      "Related Praise be to Allah.Firstly: Divorce in writing does not count as such unless the husband intends it as such. If he writes a divorce to his wife but he did not intend to divorce her, then divorce does not take place according to the majority of scholars, and this was the view favoured by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem and Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on them). This has been explained in the answer to question no. 72291. Based on this, the text message that you sent via mobile phone does not count as a divorce because you did not intend it as such. Secondly: If a man says to his wife, “You are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced,” intending thereby one talaaq and only repeating the phrase for emphasis or to make sure his wife understands the words, this only counts as one talaaq, according to the four imams (may Allaah have mercy on them). See: al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (1/221). Based on this, when you said to your wife “You are divorced, you are divorced, you are divorced,” intending thereby only one talaaq, it counted as one talaaq, and this was the second talaaq. As her ‘iddah has ended, you cannot take her back, but there is nothing wrong with doing a new marriage contract with her, subject to the usual conditions of marriage: the woman’s consent, and the presence of two witnesses and her wali (guardian), etc. She can come back to you on the basis of this marriage contract, with the outstanding number of divorces, i.e., there is only one talaaq left with her. You should help your wife to get rid of this depression by finding out its causes and dealing with them, and by pursuing the means that will help to bring her relief and peace of mind. And Allaah knows best.\n"

However, if he finds out that the janaba was from a previous sleep, then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred1. The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba in preparation for salaat are many, one of which is Allah's command in the Qur'an, a translated meaning of which is: \"O' You who believe, do not get approach salaat while you are drunk until you know what you are saying, nor while impure due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform ghusl\" (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said \"I was a man with frequent urethral discharge, so I kept performing ghusl until the skin of my back started cracking, so I mentioned this to the Prophet peace be upon him (or it was mentioned to him) so the messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, \"Don't do ghusl if you see urethral discharge, just wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat. If semen appears, then perform ghusl\"2. This hadith indicates that appearance of semen requires ghusl whereas urethral discharge only needs washing of the sexual organ followed by wudu'.From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situtations...? 1 Al-Mughni ma'a al-Sharh il-Kabeer 1/199. 2 Narrated by Abu Dawood number 206 and verified sahih by Albani in Arwaa' al-Ghaleel number 125.\n",

      "Contents Related Male circumcision in Islam Is male circumcision mandatory in Islam? Is circumcision necessary for conversion to Islam? Praise be to Allah.Thank you for submitting this question. The issue of circumcision is one of the issues which in several cases forms a barrier for some of those who want to enter the religion of Islam. The matter is easier than many people think. Male circumcision in Islam As for circumcision, it is one of the symbols of Islam. It is part of sound human nature (fitrah), and is part of the way of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth.” [an-Nahl 16:123] The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old…” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6/388) Is male circumcision mandatory in Islam? Circumcision is obligatory for a Muslim man, if he is able to do it. If he is not able to do it, such as if he fears that he may die if he is circumcised, or if a trustworthy doctor has told him that it will lead to haemorrhaging that may cause his death, then he is exempt from circumcision in that case, and he is not sinning if he does not do it. Is circumcision necessary for conversion to Islam? It is not appropriate under any circumstances to let the issue of circumcision be a barrier that prevents a person from entering the faith; rather the soundness of a person’s Islam does not depend upon him being circumcised. A person’s entering the religion of Islam is valid even if he does not get circumcised . With regard to the issue of female circumcision, you will find the answer in question no. 427 . I ask Allah to enable you to do all that is good and to protect you from all that is evil. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.This case depends on the type of blood. Is the blood what is known as post-natal bleeding (nifas) or vaginal bleeding (istihadah ) (but not part of her regular period)? The scholars have declared the regulation in this matter. They said: \"If she sees the blood after the abortion of a formed human being, then it is nifas; if she sees blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas.\" (Al-Mughni ma' al-Sharh al-Kabir 1/361) In the latter case, she is considered to be mustahada, so she performs wudu for every prayer when the time for it is due and she prays. Whereas if the aborted object is a fetus or has human-formed organs like an arm or a leg or a head, then it is considered nifas. For the case where the aborted object is disposed of in the hospital before the woman saw it, the scholars have mentioned that the least amount of time human form starts to take place is eighty one days after pregnancy. (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/292) This is based on the report of ‘Abdullah Bin Mas’ud's hadith (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) spoke to us, and he is the truthful and believed one, and said: \"Each one of you, human creation, forms in his mother's womb for forty days, then he is a hanging clot for the same amount of time, then he is a mudghah (the size of a morsel) for the same amount of time, then Allah sends an angel who is commanded with four things: he is told to write his deeds, his livelihood and sustenance, whether he is happy or distressed \" (Sahih al-Buhari 6/303) Ladies in this case should spend the effort to find out from the doctors' estimations until her situation is clear to her. As for the blood that is discharged just prior to a normal delivery, if it is accompanied with the pains of contraction, then it is nifas, and if not, then it is not. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) said: \"What she sees when the contractions commence is nifas. What is referred to here is contractions after which follows delivery; otherwise it is not nifas.\" (Majmu’ Fatawa Ibn ‘Uthaymin 4/327) Reference: “What Should You Do in the Following Situations by Sheikh Muhammad Salih Al-Munajjid.\n",

      "Contents Related Satanic whispers during prayer Tips on how to stay focused in prayer Praise be to Allah.Satanic whispers during prayer This happened to one of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) whose name is ‘Uthman ibn Abi Al-’As, (may Allah be pleased with him). ’Uthman came complaining to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and said: \"The Shaytan comes between me and my prayer and causes me problems with my recitation.\" So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"That is a Shaytan called Khanzab , so if you feel his presence, seek refuge in Allah and blow a mist to your left three times.\" He said: \"I applied this advice and Allah has rid me of him.” (Sahih Muslim, 2203) Tips on how to stay focused in prayer This hadith includes two ways on how to get rid of the shaytan while praying . Seeking refuge in Allah from the Shaytan's evil by pronouncing the words of seeking refuge and this is OK in this case. Blowing with mist to the left three times. This is basically blowing air in a similar manner to spitting, but with a minute mist of saliva, on the condition that this does not disturb or bother the person next to him, nor make the masjid dirty.

The question of does he repeat maghrib has two scholarly opinions: the first is that he repeats. This is the saying of Ibn Omar, Malik, Abi Hanifa and Ahmad in what is most well-known about this issue. The second opinion is that he does not repeat. This is the saying of Ibn Abbas, the Shafiei madhab, and the second opinion of Ahmads school of thought. The latter is more correct, for Allah did not make it obligatory on the person to pray a salaat twice if he has feared Allah as much as he can (wallahu a'lam [and Allah knows best]).1 From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations... ? 1 Majmooa Fatawi Ibn Taimiyya 22/106.\n",

If it appears to him that the imam is resident, then he should pray the complete prayer. The evidence: what Imam Ahmad authenticated and narrated that Ibn Abbas was asked: \"What is reason that the traveler prays two rakaat (iterations of prayer) if he is alone and four rakaat if he is led in [a full] prayer by a resident? So he said, that is the sunna (tradition of the Prophet ), and in another narration \"That is the sunna of Abi Al-Qasim.\" Take the case of one who assumes that the imam is a traveler, and thus prays with him two rakaat with intention of qasr. Then, after salaam (completion of prayer) with the imam, it becomes clear to him [from speaking with others after the prayer, for example] that the imam is actually a resident and that the two rakaat that he had prayed were the imam’s third and fourth. In such an instance, he should stand up and make two rakaat to complete the prayer, he makes sujood sahw (an extra two prostrations).

      "Praise be to Allah.If a person praying needs to do something relatively minor during prayer, like opening a door and the like, it is OK as long as his direction does not change from the qibla (direction of prayer). The evidence for this is what Abu Dawood narrated that Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her), said, \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), used to pray with the door closed, so I arrived and asked him to open it, so he came and opened it and returned to his prayer\" (the narrator mentioned that the door was in the direction of the qibla).1 The same is true if a mother needed, while praying, to save her child from danger or harm and the likesmall movement to the right or left, or forward or backward, does not harm the prayer. Similarly if the ridaa (upper body cover) falls off, the praying person can pick it up and if the izar (lower body cover) became loose, then he can tighten it up. The sharia (laws of Islam) have allowed for the praying person in some cases excessive movement even if he were to change direction from qibla, as evident in the hadith of Abu Huraira, (may Allah be pleased with him), where he said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), said: Kill the two black things while in prayer: the snake and scorpion. \"2 Also, preventing a person from passing in the place of prostration by pushing (or even fighting him if he insists) is prescribed, as related in Bukhari from hadith Abi Saleh Al-Samman, who said: \"I saw Aba Saeed Al-Khudri on Friday praying with something in front of him to protect him from [passing] people, and a young man from Bani Abi Muaet wanted to pass in front of him in the place of prostration. So Abu Saeed pushed the mans chest, so the man looked [around] and did not find any place from which to walk except in front of him, so he tried to pass in front of him again. Abu Saeed pushed him harsher than the first time, so he cursed Abu Saeed. Then the young man went to Marwan and complained about Abu Saeeds action and Abu Saeed entered after him at Marwans place so Marwan said: What is the matter with you, doing that to your brothers son oh Abu Saeed.? He said: I heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) saying: \"If one of you prays with something in front of him protecting him from [passing] people, and someone wants to pass in front of him, then he should push him, and if he refuses to [turn back], then fight him, for he is a shaitan (satan).\"3 From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations... ? 1 Sunan Abu Dawood, number 922, and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 815.2 Sunan Abu Dawood, number 921, and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 814.3 Narrated al-Bukhari Fath 1/582.\n",

The right of the person himself who was murdered cannot be compensated for in this world.

Or, the bribe was taken from an unjust (zalim) man like he was himself before he repented. That is, someone who achieved or attained things via bribes which were not his right. This amount is not to be returned to him. Instead the repentant should spend it in a charitable way, such as on the poor and the destitute.

When a man who used to sell wine or drugs repents he should not return the amounts to those who used to buy from him. Nor should he who used to swear for others as a false witness return the amounts he earned to those for whose benefit he used to swear. The reason being that if he returns the amounts to him who paid, then he will be depositing with him both the unlawful money as well as the unlawful commodity that he took through bribe or wages of sin.

Questions of this sort are asked so often and by so many that it is time Muslims paid serious attention to their reformation in the light of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings), in order that such things do not occur in the first place. Special stress is to be placed on the lowering of the gaze, no bodily contact (including shaking hands) between men and women, wearing of the full hijab (women’s Islamic dress code), prohibition of meetings in secrecy in particular and of mixing of sexes in general, discouraging unwarranted travel to non-Muslim countries, and early marriages. As for the question about one who committed fornication, there can be two situations. Either the man did it by force, that is, raped the woman. Such a man should pay her the amount of mahr (dower) in accordance with her social class, as compensation for what harm he caused her. As for himself, he should sincerely repent. And, if the matter has reached the authorities, then he should be punished according to the law of shari’ah (Islamic law). See Madarij. Or, he has had sex with a woman who consented to the act. There is nothing due from such a man except repentance. Neither the child is his, nor is the cost of upbringing born by him because it is an illegal child and must be attached to the mother and not the father. The man’s marriage to the woman, for the sake of covering up the issue, is also not permissible. For Allah revealed in the Quran a verse whose meaning can be translated as: “An adulterer does not marry but an adulteress or mushrika (female polytheist). And an adulteress does not marry but an adulterer or mushrik (male polytheist).” (24:3) It is also not permissible to marry a woman who is pregnant from an adulterous act, even if the man has fathered the baby in the womb, as it is also not permissible to marry a woman about whom it is not known if she is pregnant or not. Nonetheless, if he repents, and she also repents, and she is not carrying a child, then it is permissible for him to marry her and begin a new life. If she is carrying a child, they must wait until she gives birth. And Allah knows best.\n",

This renunciation is an obligation and is a precondition for the acceptance of repentance. Allah says (what means): “Save for those who repent, make amends and show clearly [what they used to say/rule wrongly], it is from those whom I accept their repentance, and I am very Forgiving, very Compassionate.” [2:160] The tafseer (explanation) for this verse indicates that it was revealed regarding the scholars of ahl ul-kitab (People of the Book) who used to conceal what had been revealed regarding the signs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the commands to believe in him. The repentant person should now engage themselves in the spread of the truth of Islam, spending their energies in defense of its teachings, and educating people in their religion. They should use their power of speech or writing to counterattack the forces of falsehood, to expose their deceits, plans and strategies, even as he used to co-operate with them in opposing Islam, and thus become a sword in the defense of Islam. It is also binding on he who convinced another man, even if in a private meeting, against things declared haram (forbidden) by Islam, such as, for instance, taking interest, to get in touch with the person he was instrumental in changing his opinion and let him know of his own renewed enlightenment.

      "Related Praise be to Allah.If a person prays in a mosque and then goes to another one to attend a lecture or for any other reason, and finds the people there praying, then he should join them and his prayer would be considered a supererogatory (nafilah, nafl, tatawwu‘) prayer . He should do so even if it is during the prohibited times of prayer because there is a reason behind it. The evidence for this comes from what has been narrated in the hadith of Yazid bin Al-Aswad (may Allah be pleased with him) in Sunan Al-Tirmidhi in the chapter on “What has been reported about a person who prayed alone and then joins a congregation”: “He said: I performed Hajj with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and prayed Fajr with him in Masjid Al-Khayf. When he completed his prayer and turned around, he found two people who did not pray with him. He said: I have to talk to them. So he came to them and they were trembling. He asked them: What prevented you two from praying with us? They said: O Prophet of Allah! We had already prayed in our places. He said: Do not do that. If you already prayed at your places and then came to a congregational mosque, pray with them too and it will become a supererogatory prayer for you.” (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, No. 219; Sahih Al-Jami‘, No. 667) In another hadith it is narrated that the two came after the Fajr prayer which is a prohibited time for prayer. Imam Malik has reported in Muwatta in the chapter on “What has been narrated about repeating the prayer with the Imam after a person has prayed individually”: Mihjan (may Allah be pleased with him), says that he was in the company of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) prayed in congregation and returned while Mihjan himself did not pray with them. So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: What prevented you from praying with the people? Are you not a Muslim? He said: Indeed, O Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)! But I had already prayed at home. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: When you come (to the mosque) then pray with the people even if you have prayed.” For more about repeating prayers, please see these answers: 90038 , 9023 , and 32680 .

      "Praise be to Allah.If a person enters the mosque and is praying the sunnah while the iqamah is called, then the best opinion in this case is that if he is in his second rak‘ah, he should shorten it, and if he is in the first rak‘ah, he should just break his prayer and enter the congregation with the Imam1. The evidence for this comes from what Imam Muslim has narrated in his Sahih: Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If iqamah is called for the prayer then there is no prayer except the obligatory one. (Sahih Muslim, 1/493) So, if one has performed the ruku‘ for the second rak‘ah, then he should complete the prayer, and if not, then he should discontinue because what is left from his sujud and tashahhud is not needed any more. Moreover, he should break without salaam, and it is enough to have the intention in the heart, contrary to common misconception.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If there is a congregation praying, and during their prayer they are informed about the right direction of qiblah, they should all turn towards the correct direction. The same is also true for someone praying individually. Whatever part of their prayer has been performed (before changing direction) will be correct. The evidence for this a narration by Imam Muslim from Anas (may Allah be please with him), that: While the Prophet (peace be upon him) was praying towards Bayt-al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), the verse was revealed to him (translation of meaning): Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a qiblah that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram. (Al-Baqarah, 2:144). A man from Bani Salamah was passing by and found them (i.e., the people of Bani Salamah) in the state of ruku‘ in the Fajr prayer in the second rak‘ah. He shouted to them: Indeed the qiblah has been changed. So, turn to the qiblah as they (i.e., the Prophet and his Companions) have. (Sahih Musim, No. 527) If some of the people were informed and the others were not, then the one to whom it was made clear should turn to the direction he believes to be the correct direction of qiblah. Now if all of these people (who were informed or not) were originally praying together in the same direction, and some of them turned towards right and some towards left, it is correct for some to follow others. But the scholars have a difference of opinion about some people following others in the situation where there was complete disagreement (among the praying people) about the direction of the qiblah. If there was someone among them who was completely ignorant about the direction, he should follow the one who is more aware amongst them of the direction of the qiblah.1 For the one who was uninformed about the direction f the qiblah, must ask someone if he can, or else he should make ijtihad (make a judgment based on the best of his ability with the information available) if he is able to, otherwise he must follow someone who is reliable. If he cannot find one, then he should do his best in obedience to Allah and complete his prayer, and his prayer is correct. This sometimes happens to a number of those who travel to the lands of disbelievers and find no Muslim around them to inform them of the correct direction of qiblah. If one was capable of finding out the direction of the qiblah, but was neglectful and prayed without making all possible efforts, he should repeat his prayer because he was careless.2 1 Al-Mughni, 1/473. 2Al-Mughni, 1/490\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If someone is praying in a congregation and the loud speaker stops working or the person is drowsy, and he lags behind the Imam by one or more obligatory acts (arkaan) of prayer (i.e., the Imam performed it and he could not because of not hearing the Imam’s voice), then when he returns to consciousness or the sound of the speaker returns back, he should complete the missed obligatory acts and then continue with the Imam. This situation has many cases. Take for example the following case: the Imam recited a verse that contains the word of prostration (sajdah) and the people misunderstood it to be an actual verse of prostration while in reality it is not, so when the Imam says takbeer for ruku‘ at the end of the verse and performs ruku‘, some of the followers (especially those towards the rear of the rows) take it to be the takbeer for the prostration of recital, thus going into prostration. When the Imam stands up from the ruku‘ saying “sami‘a Allahu li man hamidah”, they return back (stand up) from their prostration. Thus, they missed the act of ruku‘ and standing up from it. So it is incumbent on them to complete what they missed and then catch up with the Imam. This is because they did not do it intentionally. However, for the one who intentionally lags behind the Imam (e.g., someone who prolongs his prostration to make a long supplication such that he misses the obligatory act which is after the prostration) the majority of the scholars say that the prayer of someone who misses two consecutive obligatory acts of prayer without a valid excuse, is void and he is sinful.1 However, in principle the Imam must be followed as said by the Prophet (peace be upon him): The Imam is selected to be followed; the, do not differ with him. When he makes the takbeer, make the takbeer, when he goes into ruku‘, make ruku‘. When he says “samia‘ Allahu li man hamidah” (Allah hears he who praises Him), say “Rabbanaa lakal Hamd” (O our Lord! To You belongs the Praise). When he goes into sajdah, make sajdah. If he prays sitting, then all should be sitting. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 689)\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If the Imam enters the state that nullifies his ablution or prayer, or remembers during the prayer that he did not perform ablution, then he should come out from prayer and appoint someone from the attendees who can lead them to completion. This has been narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali, ‘Alqamah and ‘Ataa’. If he did not appoint anyone and the people prayed individually, this would be acceptable, and this is the opinion taken by Imam Al-Shafi‘i. If he elected someone and advanced him to lead them, that is also permitted. The evidence for this is what has been narrated regarding ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) when he was stabbed. He took Abdur Rahman bin ‘Auf who led the prayer to completion.1 And the reason for this deduction is that ‘Umar did so in the presence of a number of Companions and others and no one opposed this act, so it became a consensus (ijma‘).2 If the Imam remembers that he is not in a state of purity, he should indicate to the followers to remain as they are and purify himself and come back to lead them. The evidence for this is the following narration of Abu Dawud from Abu Bakrah: The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) entered into the Fajr prayer and indicated to the people that they should stay in their places. Then he came back to lead them and water was dripping from his head. (Sunan Abi Dawud, No. 233; Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 1/45) Commenting on this hadith, Imam Al-Khatabi says: In this hadith there is an evidence that if one is leading the people in prayer while in a state of impurity and the people do no know of it, then their prayer is unaffected and there is no need for them to repeat it. But the Imam has to repeat his prayer.3 If one is praying (either as Imam or follower or individually) and recalls that he had wiped over his socks during wudu’ while the duration of wiping had expired, he should terminate his prayer because his ablution is incorrect. This is what has been quoted from Imams Ahmad and Al-Shafi‘i.4 Sahih Al-Bukhari/Fath Al-Bari, 7/60. 2 Ahkam Al-Imamah by Al-Muneef, 234, 1st Edition. 3 Ma‘alim As-Sunan by Al-Khatabi (Collected by Al-Da‘as) 1/159. 4 Al-Mughni, 2/505.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If the Imam remembers in the final tashahhud (sitting of the prayer) that he had recited at-tahiyyaat (the greetings mentioned during the sitting) in the beginning of the rak‘ah instead of Al-Fatihah, he should stand up and offer another rak‘ah, which is correct in exchange for the one he performed incorrectly and did not recite Al-Fatihah. This is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: There is no prayer for the one who did not recite (in it) Al-Fatihah (the opening chapter of the Qur’an). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 723) It is also required for the followers to follow him even though it would be the fifth rak‘ah for them. If they do not understand and do not stand up, and say “subhan Allah” to indicate to Imam that he is error, the Imam should inform them by hand movements to the right and left to tell them that he did it purposefully and to indicate to them to stand up. However, if something like this happens to one of the followers behind the Imam, his prayer will be correct as long as he followed his Imam. The evidence for this is the Hadith of Abu Bakrah when he entered into the prayer in the position of ruku‘ and did not recite Al-Fatihah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him: May Allah increase your endeavor. You do not need to repeat. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, No. 750) If the follower forgets to recite Al-Fatihah or is ignorant of its obligatory nature or finds the Imam in the state of ruku‘, then his rak‘ah will be considered as complete and his prayer correct. He does not need to repeat the rak‘ah, as he is his excused due to ignorance or forgetfulness or if he missed catching the qiyam (the position standing upright).

      "Praise be to Allah.If someone, after raising his head from ruku‘, remembers that he did not say the supplications of ruku‘, he should not return back to the ruku‘ because the requirement for supplication of ruku‘ has been dropped by virtue of his rising it. If he returns back to the ruku‘ intentionally, this action would render his prayer invalid since he added an extra rukn (pillar, or obligatory act of the prayer) which is this second superfluous ruku‘. However, if he did it in ignorance or forgetfulness, his prayer will not be nullified, but in this case he must make the prostration of forgetfulness if he was praying individually or leading a congregation. This is because tasbeeh (subhaana Rabbi al-Azeem, How Perfect is my Lord, the Supreme, or another supplication of ruku‘) is wajib (required), and forgetting it makes the prostration of forgetfulness necessary.

If he does return knowing that his return is unapproved of, his prayer will be nullified because he has already started another obligatory act. Due to his missing the wajib (i.e., tashahhud) he is forced to make the prostrations of forgetfulness. The evidence is the hadith narrated by Al-Mugheerah bin Shu‘bah that: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If the Imam stands up after the second rak‘ah, and remembers that he has to sit, before he straightens himself (upright), then he should sit down, and if he straightened upright, he should not sit and make two prostrations of forgetfulness. (Abu Dawud, No. 1036; Silsilah Al-Sahihah, 321) In short, if someone stands up for the third rak‘ah, forgetting the tashahhud, he is in one of the three situations: He remembers it before standing up straight: then he should return to tashahhud. He remembers after standing up straight, and before starting the recitation of Al-Fatihah: then it is better for him not to sit, but if he sits his prayer will be correct. He remembers it after starting the recitation of Al-Fatihah: then he is not allowed to return to tashahhud. (al-Mughni 1/677) These three cases have been deduced from the above Hadith.\n",

For example, suppose a woman has a normal period of 6 days. However, during a given month blood continued to flow until 15 days had passed, while she is still waiting for the end of the period. In this case she makes ghusl immediately, and starts praying, and prays all the prayers for the 9 days counted from the end of her normal period until she made ghusl. The reason for this is that the longest that a woman's menstrual cycle can be is 15 days according to madhab Imam Ahmed and many scholars (al-Mughni 1:388). Thus, if the flow continues past 15 days, then everything after the number of days in a normal cycle is considered istihada (which is blood that flows from a woman due to reasons other than menstruation, such as from a burst vein, hemorrhage, etc.) Regarding making up the missed prayers, she should pray them consecutively in order by intention, in one session, and she can rest if she gets tired.\n",

This situation about which this sister is asking is a common one and occurs often as a result of a clash of desires between parents and their daughter. It could be for a benefit or interest the mother or father sees and the young woman doesnt, and each regards the issue from a different perspective or with a particular consideration. And perhaps the opinion of the parents is the appropriate and correct one as a result of their prior trials and longer experience in life, and perhaps the woman sometimes looks to the appearance of the groom more than anything else, whereas the parents may look to other considerations, such as his family status, or his long-term career or employment. Of course none of this means that the womans opinion isnt sometimes more correct and preferable, particularly when the opinion of the parents stems from a benefit they may realize if the marriage is accomplished, and they do not actually make the priority their daughter who is the most important thing in this issue. And while being vigilant in advising you of the importance of obeying ones parents and struggling with oneself to realize their wishes and desires and giving their opinion the priority, the point must clearly be made that the following two hadeeth from the Prophet (peace be upon him) must be abided by and carried out, as within them are the complete answer to your question and questions from others in similar situations: The first hadeeth: If he whose character and deen (practice of religion) pleases you, approaches you in marriage, then marry him, for if you dont, their will be fitna in the land and vast corruption. (Tirmidhi and others, see Sunan Tirmidhi #1085 and it is hassan (reliable) as per Sahih ul-Jaami #270). (fitna here can be understood to refer to the temptation for fornication, enmity and the cutting off of relations among the people and relatives, and the spreading of hatred) The second: Buraida (may Allah be pleased with him) said that a young woman came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, My father married me to his brothers son (i.e. her cousin) in order to raise his standing among the people, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) put the matter in her hands (i.e. asserted that the validity of the marriage is conditioned on her approval and negated by her refusal). So she said, I authorize and endorse what he has done but I wanted women to know that fathers cannot force their will in these matters. And it was narrated by NisaaI via Abdullah ibn Buraida via Aaisha that a young woman came to her and said, My father married me to his brothers son in order to raise his standing among the people and I am unwilling (to agree to it), so she said, Sit until the Prophet (peace be upon him) comes. So the Prophet (peace be upon him) came and she informed him of the situation, so he sent for her father and invited him (over) and asserted that the matter is in the brides hands. So she said, Oh Prophet of Allah I have authorized and endorsed what my father has done, but I wanted to know if women had a say in the matter or not. (Sunan al-NisaaI, Kitaab al-Nikaah min Sunanihi and it is sahih). I ask Allah for you success and guidance to that in which there is blessings for you and your family, and may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad .\n",

      "Contents Related Man-woman relationship before marriage Conditions to marry a second wife in Islam Second marriage in Islam: Do you need permission from your first wife? Praise be to Allah.Man-woman relationship before marriage Before responding to this question, a comment must be made regarding an objectionable and reprehensible issue implied in the question, and that is the mentioning by the sister that he “falls in love with another woman”. It is known that it is not permissible in the Islamic religion to establish a relationship between a man and a woman who is ajanabiyya to him (lit. foreign, i.e., marriageable) before marriage, for Allah revealed in Surat al-Maidah (the Table), ayah 5 a verse whose meaning can be translated as: “This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste and virtuous women who are believers, but chaste women among People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues. If anyone rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good).” And the word “akhdan” that appears in this ayah (appearing above as “secret intrigues”) means intimate friend or companion, and in this case refers to a lover , and Allah has indicated in Surat al-Ahzab (33:53) that a condition for talking with women when it is needed is: (a translation of the meaning) “…and if you ask them (women) for something you want, ask them from behind a hijab (both in the sense of a physical barrier such as a screen or wall, as well as in clothing); that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs…” And Allah has commanded women not to speak with soft, sensual voices with a man who is ajnabi (lit. foreign, meaning one to whom marriage is not forbidden) so that he is not tempted by their voices, and so as not to provoke feelings of lust. Allah ta'ala said in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 32, a verse whose meaning can be translated as: “… if you do fear (Allah) be not too complacent of speech lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire; but utter sufficient and appropriate speech.” (33:32) So how could it possibly be permissible after all of these injunctions to establish love or friendship relations among women and men who are ajanib (marriageable)? Conditions to marry a second wife in Islam And as for the original matter of the question, Allah (subhanahu wa-ta’ala), Who is al-Hakim (All Wise) al-Khabir (All Experienced), and Who is more knowledgeable about the human beings He created than they themselves are about themselves, has ordained that a man is allowed to marry whom he wills among women as long as he does not bond in marriage under his care and responsibility more than four women . And this is conditioned upon him dealing justly among them the known justice specified by Shari’ah which includes overnight stays and spending. If he does not have the ability and capacity to deal with such justice , then he should suffice with one, as Allah indicates in Surat al-Nisa in ayah 3, which has a meaning that can be translated as: “… marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with them) then only one…” (4:3) And Allah’s Shari’ah (law) is all just and wise, and He ordains what He wills and does what He wants and it is incumbent upon as human beings to believe and have faith and submit and obey and abide by the Shari`ah, otherwise then we are not Muslims nor mu’minin (believers). As Allah also said in Surat al-Nisa, ayah 65, a verse whose meaning can be translated as: “But no, by your Lord, they can have no (real) faith until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction” (4:65) and in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 36, a meaning that can be translated as: “It is not fitting for a mu’min (believing man) or mu’minah (believing woman) when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if anyone disobeys Allah and His Apostle he is indeed strayed on a manifestly wrong path.” (33:36) Second marriage in Islam: Do you need permission from your first wife? Furthermore, no evidence appears either in the Quran or sunnah requiring the permission of the first wife if her husband wishes to marry another wife, and therefore he is not required to ask her permission. However, he needs to be judicious in taking this decision and to weigh it carefully with respect to benefits and drawbacks and to look with the eye of wisdom at all of the considerations pertaining to the matter, and he should strive all he can to conciliate, reassure, and satisfy his first wife, in order to ease and mitigate the effect of the matter upon her.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Nisaab ul-Zakat for naqd (gold and silver) is defined as the minimum amount of naqd specified by shari’a below which one is not required to pay zakat, whereas if one’s wealth exceeds it then zakat becomes incumbent. And it is known that zakat ul-maal (wealth) in shari’a is required for the two types of naqd—gold and silver—and what serves their function in modern times (commonly referred to as cash), whether it is dollars or riyals or pounds or otherwise. Nisaab for gold as our Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed us (and for currencies made from gold) is 20 mithqaalan, a measure which is equivalent to 85 grams of pure gold (1 mithqaal = 4.25 grams). It becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%. Nisaab for silver and currencies made from silver is 200 dirhams, which is equivalent to 595 grams of pure silver (1 dirham = 2.975 grams). Likewise, it becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%. It is well known that there is a noticeable disparity between the value of nisaab for gold and that of silver in our times. The best and most conservative for a poor person is to assess how many dollars he has that have been in his possession for a complete lunar year (Hijri, which is 354 days). If the amount reaches the value of nisaab for silver or more, then he should pay from it for every 1000 dollars, 25 dollars (i.e., 2.5%) to be spent in the prescribed benficiaries as specified by shari’ah, and we ask Allah to aid us and help us succeed in haqq il-maal wa salla allahu ala nabiyyana muhammad\n",

If he had known at the time he was working about the prohibition of the haram things, then his income in this situation comprises mixed money, both halal and haram.

      "Praise be to Allah.All Praise is due to Allaah A- Evidence From The Qur'an First Evidence Our Lord tabaraka wa ta'aala said what may be translated as {And when you [i.e., the commander of an army] are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you and let them carry their arms. And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you} (Quran 4:102) I say: In the verse is an order to establish salat, and the order was repeated once more, \"and let the other party ...\" There is evidence here that jama'ah meaning congregational prayer is obligatory on all because the obligation did not fall from being upon the second party simply by the congregation of the first party. Allah has commanded a congregational prayer while they are in a state of war and fear, and if it were only a sunnah then it would have been better to abandon the congregational prayer; however, since Allah has ordered it, and obligations like following the Imam are allowed to be violated in order for the second party to pray behind the Imam. This proves clearly that the congregational prayer is obligatory. This is a clear proof, and there is none amongst Muslims (scholars) that denies the salat of fear ordered in this verse. Second Evidence Our Lord the Exalted has said what may be translated as \"The day that a Shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not be able to. Their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them, seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration while they were whole, and had refused.\" (Quran 68:42-43) The evidence here is from several facets amongst them: Allah punished them because they did not answer the call to prostrate. The one that is calling to salat is the one calling Athan. As has been explained by the hadeeth of Ibn Abi Maktoom: the Prophet told him \"do you hear Hayya Alassalat, Hayya Alalfalah (parts of the call to prayer)\"? He said yes, then the Prophet said \"fahayhala\" which means something like \"then go answer the call.\" This hadeeth is sahih (which means sound, and authentic) and is narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. So he learned that the one who does not answer the call, has not answered. Third Evidence Allah ta'aala said what might be translated as \"Establish salat and pay your zakat and bow with those that are bowing\". (Quran 2:43) The proof therein is: That Allah ordered us to bow, and meaning salat because it is a pillar of the salat. His statement which was translated as \"with those that are bowing\" is an order to bow with those that are bowing, and that is not accomplished except through congregation. So this is evidence that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because the meaning of the verse is not accomplished except through congregation. B- Evidence From The Sunnah First Evidence Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah said \"The heaviest salat for the hypocrite is that of Isha'a and Fajr and if they knew what was in them they would have attended them even if it meant crawling, and I have a strong desire to order the salat to be established, then order a man to lead the people in salat then I would go with some men carrying bundles of wood to a people not attending the salat and burn their houses on them.\" Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim, and this was Muslim's version. This hadeeth proves that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because one's house would not be burned for leaving a sunnah. Those of the opinion that salat al-jama'ah is not obligatory find refuge in a few excuses with regards to this hadeeth which follow: They said this punishment is in reference to those that do not attend the Jum'ah (Friday) prayer, and their evidence in this regard is the hadeeth of Abdullah Bin Mas'ood narrated by Muslim that the Prophet said to a people that miss the Friday prayer \"I have a strong desire to order a person to lead the salat and I would burn the homes of those that have missed the Friday prayer\". This is not in contradiction to the hadeeth of Abu Huraira because Ibn Mas'ood is stating that the burning is for those that miss the Friday prayer, and Abu Huraira is stating that the burning is for those that miss salat al-jama'ah and there is no contradiction between the two because the hadeeth of Abu Huraira clearly states the Isha'a and Fajr and it is likely that what is meant is to show that both cases are worthy of the burning. They say: This has been abrogated! My reply is: Where is the proof that this has been abrogated, and who has narrated it? However, to simply claim abrogation without evidence is a forgery upon Allah which is not backed by any knowledge. They say: The Prophet wanted to burn their houses because they were hypocrites, not because they did not attend the prayer in congregation. The best rebuttal of this statement was given by Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him in his statement, ...as for your claim that he wanted to punish them because of their hypocrisy, and not for missing the congregation this implies two errors: The first: cancelling what the Messenger confirmed and related to missing the congregation. The second: Confirming what the Messenger cancelled. For he never punished the hypocrites for their hypocrisy; to the contrary, he used to accept from them what they announced, and left what they concealed between them and Allah. As such the hadeeth of Abu Huraira remains a strong argument for the obligation of salat al jama'ah. Second Evidence What Muslim narrated in his Sahih that a blind man said, \"Oh Messenger of Allah, I do not have someone to guide me to the Mosque,\" and thus asked the Messenger to grant him special permission not to attend congregational prayers. As he was leaving, the Messenger called him and said \"Do you hear the call? \", he said \"yes\". He said, \"Then answer.\" Authentic versions narrated by Ahmed and others came as: narrated by Ibn Maktoom that he said: \"Oh Messenger of Allah, I am blind, live far away, and have a guide that does not suit me, so can't you give me consent to pray at home?\" He said \"Do you hear the call?\" Ibn Maktoom replied \"Yes\". The Prophet then said \"I cannot find an excuse for you\". If the blind man has no excuse not to pray in congregation, how can there be an excuse for the one that can see? Those that conclude salat al-jama'ah to be sunnah say, \"This is an order to pray in congregation that implies the preference not the obligation of salat al-jama'ah\". The response to this is that since the order here was unrestricted one needs supportive evidence to conclude that it was only meant to show preference. Now how about supportive evidence confirming salat al-jama'ah to be obligatory. If supportive evidence were not necessary to conclude that an order was stated to imply preference then each and every order could be understood to have been implying preference, and nothing would remain obligatory. Third Evidence Narrated by Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them (him, and his father), that the Prophet said, \"Whosover hears the call to salat, and does not respond, then there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse.\" This is a sound, and authentic hadeeth. Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote in his Risalat Assalat \"... and mind you this chain (referring to chain of narration of the above hadeeth) is authentic.\" This hadeeth has been narrated by Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Daar qutni, Al-Hakim, Al-Baghawi, Bayhaqi, and has also been traced and judged authentic by the following scholars: Al-Thahabi, Al-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani, Ibn Taimiya, Ibn Qayyim Al, and Al-Albani. Some have spoken about this hadeeth, claiming that its chain is stopped (literal translation for the Arabic word mawqoof; however, the authentic chains of narrations which have been traced to the Prophet contradict their claim. That hadeeth states that whoever does not answer the call, there is no salat for him, and this judgment would not be passed to someone who is simply going against an order which implies preference, and not obligation. Fourth Evidence Abdullah Bin Mas'ood said: who ever would be pleased to meet Allah as a Muslim, then let him take care of those salat which are called to because they are of the ways of huda (guidance), and Allah has given to your Prophet the ways of huda. And if you were to establish salat in your homes, like that person staying behind in his home, you would be abandoning the sunnah of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the sunnah of your prophet you would surely go astray. And there is not a man amongst you that purifies himself (yatatahhar), and does so properly, then directs himself to one of these mosques except that Allah will write for him with each step he takes a hasanah (merit), and raises him a grade, and drops from him a sayyi'ah (demerit). And I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind from prayer in congregation except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy is known. And one that could not come on his own would be carried between two men until he is stood in the row. In another narration he said, \"the Messenger of Allah taught us the ways of huda, and amongst the ways of huda is salat in the Mosque in which Athan is called\". Narrated by Muslim. The evidence in this hadeeth is that not praying in congregation is considered a sign of confirmed hypocrisy. It is known that the signs of hypocrisy are those of abandoning something which is obligatory, or doing something which is haram (unlawful.) And there is not a Muslim in whose heart iman (faith) has established itself, that would want to be like the hypocrites in their attributes. Fifth Evidence Ibu Sa'eed Al-Khudry said that the Messenger of Allah said, \"If there are three let one of them be their Imam, and the one with the strongest right to be Imam is the one that is the best reciter of the Quran (both in terms of the amount memorized, and ability to recite it properly)\". Abu Ad-Darda'a said that the Messenger of Allah said \"There are not three in a town where no Athan is called, and congregational prayers are not established amongst them except that the Sheitan will overcome them, so you must stick to jama'ah because the wolf gets the stray one\". Authentic hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmed. Sixth Evidence Abu Asha'a'thaa'a Al-Muharibi said: We were sitting in the masjid (mosque) then the Mu'athin (the one that makes the call to prayer) made the call to prayer. Then a man got up from the masjid walking. Abu Huraira followed him with his sight until he left the Masjid. Then Abu Huraira said \"as for this person he has disobeyed Abal Qasim (the Messenger) \". Narrated by Muslim. Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, judged this man as having disobeyed Abal Qasim , and Abu Huraira would not have passed this verdict without knowledge of the sunnah of Abal Qasim . And whosoever is considered among the disobedient then he has left something which is obligatory. These, my Muslim brothers are some of the pieces of evidence that oblige the Muslim servant to pray in congregation, and whoever ponders in the Quran and Sunnah will find more and more. Each piece of the preceding evidence is enough in itself to be proof that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory. We also remind our brothers that the Muslim servant is not allowed to reject anything from Allah or his Messenger just because a certain scholar ruled differently. Evidence is an argument against all people. Imam's that have concluded differently are expected to have a valid excuse because even they cannot contradict clear evidence from Quran and Sunnah. Their teachings that people must follow Quran and Sunnah are well known, and they, may Allah have mercy upon them, did not become Imam's except by strong adherence to Quran and Sunnah. Know this because it is beneficial to you... Of Allah's bounty upon us with regards to this issue is that the best of people, the companions of the Messenger , have had Ijma'a (consensus) in it. There are no narrations passed down from any one of them giving leave not to pray in congregation. And following is what has been confirmed by them: Ibn Mas'ood said, \"and I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known.\" (5th evidence) Ibn Mas'ood, Abu Musa Al-Ash'ary, Ali, Abu Huraira, Ayesha, and Ibn Abbas have stated, \"Whoever hears the call to salat and does not answer, there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse.\" (3rd evidence) Ibn Al-Qayyim said after he presented the statements of the companions: \"These are statements of the companions as you find them, authentic and well known, and there is not one known statement from any of the companions which contradicts this. Each of these pieces of evidence is enough all by itself, so how about when they all enforce one another. Verily in Allah is our success.\" These are the statements of the people of knowledge: Al-Baghawi wrote in Sharh Assunnah (3/349), \"More than one of the companions were of the opinion that whoever hears the call and does not answer, then there is no salat for him.\" Ata'a bin Rabah said, \"There is no excuse for anyone created by Allah in a city or country side not to attend if he hears the call to prayer.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"If his mother forbids him from praying Isha'a in congregation, out of pity, he should not obey her. Al-Awza'i said: \"There is no obedience to the father in leaving the Friday prayer, or the daily congregational prayers, regardless of whether one heard the call to prayer or not.\" Amongst those that have said that it is obligatory as well are Ibn Khuzaima, Al-Shafi'i, Al-Bukhari, Ibn Hibban, Dawood, Ahl Al-Dhahir, Hanabila, Ishaaq, and most of Ahl Al-Hadeeth, and some of the companions of Al-Shafi'i. You now know, may Allah have mercy upon you, the preceding evidence concerning the obligatory status of salat al-jama'ah,and the statements of those that conclude it as such from amongst the pious predecessors of our Ummah (nation.) Now what remains for you to know is that whoever prays alone, then his prayer is correct; however, he has the ithm (sin) of leaving the jama'ah (congregation). As for the acceptance, or rejection, this is up to The Creator, and no one can say that the prayer of Zaid is accepted while the prayer of Obaid is not. We ask Allaah to help us in remembering and thanking him and better worshipping him. Allaah the exalted knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If a person is performing tawaaf (circumabulation around the Ka'bah) or sa'i (between Safa and Marwah), and he comes across a need (e.g., he is thirsty and wants to drink something, or loses someone from his family members and stops to look for him, or becomes tired and wants to take some rest), and if the break was short, then he may continue his tawaaf from where he left off. If the prayer is called and he interrupts his tawaaf to pray, the scholars have disagreed on this issue. The most conservative opinion is that when he continues his tawaaf, he should not count the last round which he left incomplete.1 The issue of taking a rest in tawaaf and sa'i, however, is based on the condition that tawaaf and sa'i should be completed contiguously. In sa'i, continuity is not a requirement according to the best opinion.2 So, if a person is performing sa'i, and he breaks after some of the rounds, and then comes back to complete them, this would be considered permissible. However, regarding continuity of tawaaf, the scholars have two opinions: That continuity is waajib (mandatory), and that a long discontinuity without due justification nullifies the tawaaf. That continuity is a sunnah, and the tawaaf is not nullified even though the break was long.3 However, it is better to act according to the first opinion. 1 Fataawa Al-Hajj Wal 'Umrah by Ibn Baz, p. 80; Al Majmu' by Al-Nawawi, 8/49. 2 Al-Mughni, 3/414. 3 Al-Majmu' by Al-Nawawi, 8/47\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars (al-jumhoor) comprising the Maliki's and the Shafiei's and the Hanbali's have taken the opinion that the recognized distance for one who has undertaken its travel in shortening the prayer is four burud (an antiquated unit of distance), which is two average day's travel by heavily-loaded camels (equivalent to 88.7 km in distance). Among what they have quoted as evidence is what was authentically (sahih) narrated by Ibn Omar and Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to shorten the prayers and break fasting at a distance of four BURUD. This quoted distance is approximate and not exactly limited as per the majority of scholars, and thus what is slightly less is exempted as well. Some scholars including ibn Qadama and Sheikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyya and his pupil Ibn ul-Qayyim have taken the opinion that all that is referred to as travel in practice and in language, and requires preparation of provisions as well as rest and similar things, falls under the licenses of shari'a such as the shortening of the prayer and breaking the fast of Ramadan. Their pretext and justification is the generalization in the wording referring to the shortening of the prayer as it appears in the Qur'an and sunnah, as in the example of surat al-Nisaa', verses 4:101-102: \"When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you: for the unbelievers are unto you open enemies. When you (O Messenger) are with them, and stand to lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear. And let the other party come up - which has not yet prayed - and let them pray with you, taking all precautions, and bearing arms: the Unbelievers wish, if you were careless of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the unbelievers Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment.\" And in the following hadith: Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 2960: Ya'la bin Umayyah said: I said to 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab \"Verily Allaah has said ' if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you' and now the people feel secure.\" 'Umar said, \"[Indeed] I wondered the same thing you are wondering, so I mentioned it to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and he said '[It is] a charity that Allaah has bestowed upon you so accept His charity.' \" (Abu 'Isa said this hadith is hasan sahih.) Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 453: Umayyah ibn Abdullah ibn Khaalid ibn Asid said to Ibn 'Umar, \"How can you shorten the prayer when Allaah the Almighty has said, 'there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear' ,\" so Ibn 'Umar said, \"O son of my brother, verily the Prophet (peace be upon him) came to us when we were misguided, so he taught us, and among what he taught us was that Allaah the Almighty has ordered us to pray two raka'a during travel.\" (Al-Shu'aithiy said that al-Zuhriy used to relate this hadith via Abdullah ibn Abu Bakr.) The ayah expresses the permission for shortening the prayer for one who travels without specifically restricting the distance. Thus the Qur'an and sunnah mention \"travel\" and do not differentiate a particular travel from another, and as such if one travels via air for one hour without any burden or hardship it would be permissible for him or her to shorten the prayer and break the mandatory fast. In fact, this is the most viable opinion, unless for a particularly case there is confusion as to whether it is commonly regarded as travel or not, in which case one falls back to the opinion of the majority of scholars (al-jumhoor) (regarding the minimum required distance).\n",

It is a condition that the sin be given up immediately and that there should be true feelings of regret in the heart. This should be accompanied by the firm intention not to fall into it again. Now, with these conditions met, if he falls into it again, then this will be considered a new sin altogether, requiring a new repentance and with no connection to those of the past. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.As far as the five daily prayers are concerned, the preferred opinion is that the repetition or compensation (or what is known as qadha in Arabic), is not obligatory for the reason that prayers are obligatory at a particular time, and once that time has elapsed, there is no way to offer them. However, one should seek Allah's forgiveness and offer as many nawafil (voluntary prayers) as possible. As for fasting-yes; if a person was a Muslim at the time they became obligatory and he did not fast, then their performance is required, accompanied by the feeding of a poor Muslim for every day of fastng that was not observed during previous years. What is required is always a day for a day-no more, no less. Example 1: A person did not fast three days of Ramadan in the year 1400 A.H., and five days of Ramadan in the year 1401 A.H., all out of negligence. He must now fast eight days, and feed eight poor Muslims in compensation. Example 2: A girl reached puberty in Ramadan of the year 1400 A.H. but out of shame and modesty did not inform anyone of her menstruation, and, rather, continued fasting say for eight days of her period. Thereafter, she repented. She would then be required to redo eight days of fasting. It may also be pointed out here that this is the predominant position. A minority opinion is that the ruling for fasting is the same as that for the prayers, i.e., there is no qadha (making up) for fasting in the case of a person who did not fast and did not have a valid reason for not fasting. As for he who did not offer the obligatory zakah, it is necessary for the repentant to pay it for all previous unpaid years, for it is, from one angle, Allah's right, while from another, the poor people's right.

      "Praise be to Allah.Yes, repentance from a particular sin is acceptable even if the repentant insists on another sin which is of a different nature and not the same as the one from which he has repented. For example, if a man repents from having accepted interest but not from drinking wine, his repentance over accepting interest is acceptable, and vice versa. But if he repents from simple interest but not compound interest then his repentance is invalid. Or if he repents from taking drugs but insists on drinking wine, or vice versa, then the repentance is invalid too. It will also be incorrect and unacceptable if a man repents from adultery with one woman but commits it with another. In all of these cases they have only shifted from one variety of sin to another within the same kind. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.In all these cases it is incumbent upon you to search for them to the extent of your means. If you find them, return them their right. If the owner or owners have died, then their right should be returned to their immediate kin. However, if you cannot locate them, then spend in charity equal amounts on their behalf. Allah will give them the reward of this charity. And if they are unbelievers, Allah will compensate them in some way or other in this world itself, since there are no rewards for the unbelievers in the Hereafter. This is similar to the story that Ibn ul-Qayyim has written in his Madarij Al-Salikin (1/388). He states that a soldier of a Muslim regiment ghalla [i.e., stole from al-ghaneema (the war spoils)]. Then, after some time, he repented and took with him what he had stolen and reported to the commander of the regiment. But the commander refused to accept it back saying, 'And how do I return this to the soldiers [seeing that they have dispersed].' The man then went to a scholar - Hajjaj bin al-Sha'ir [seeking his advice]. He [Hajjaj] told him: 'Listen! Allah knows the army involved and each soldier's name and lineage. Send one fifth of the amount to the one whose right is one-fifth (this is in reference to bait ul-maal, or the central depository in the Islamic government which contains money to be spent in charity, and which receives one-fifth of all spoils of war), and spend the rest in charity in their name and Allah will give convey it to them.' The man did so. And when the news reached Mu'awiyya bin Sufyan [who was then the khalifa], he said: 'That I had been the man who gave that ruling, is dearer to me than half of what I rule over.' Imam Ibn Taymiyya has also given a similar ruling. (See Madarij)\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The answer will depend on the nature of the interests of the people involved. If the case is such that if he were to inform them of what he had once said about them, it would not be likely to increase their anger, then, he should do that and seek their forgiveness. He may then tell them - in general terms, and without offering details - that he had wronged them in the past by expressing such sentiments about them that were not right and just, and that now he has repented and seeks their forgiveness. But if the case is the opposite, that is, the fear is that if he told them of the previous backbiting or slander, they will - and in most cases that is most likely to happen - be angry with him, or will not be satisfied with the general terms, rather, will demand to know all the details, which is sure to provoke them to anger, then, in such a case, it is not obligatory on him to let them know and seek their forgiveness for the sharee'ah (Islamic law) does not order adding insult to injury. And informing a person who was in a happy mood, of things that will evoke feelings of distress or anger, is something against the purpose of the sharee'ah, which enjoins the spread of happiness and brotherliness. In fact, sometimes such action may give place to animosity where there was love. In such situations it is enough to repent in the following manner. Evoke in oneself the feeling of regret, and seek forgiveness from Allah accompanied by the conviction that it was an abominable and unlawful thing in which he had indulged. Try and make up for what he had said earlier before others by denying the presence of things and qualities he had alleged were in them and clear the person or persons involved. Follow up by mentioning and asserting good qualities of those he had spoken ill of in the presence of the same people in whose company he had slandered them. Defend the people he had slandered when they are slandered in his presence. Pray to Allah in private to forgive the sins and shortcomings of those he had wronged. (See Madarij Al-Salikin, and Al-Mughni with explanatory notes for further elucidation). You must note, dear brother Muslim or sister Muslimah, that there is a difference between the material rights of the people and non-material rights, between backbiting and defamation. When the material rights are returned to the people, they are put to some use and cause increase in happiness, and therefore they must not be put under the mattress. Whereas non-material rights, such as those concerning a man's honor, when returned to the people can only cause increase in distress. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The basis for the answer is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: \"He upon whom his brother has a right, be it of the nature of money or honor, let him compensate for it before he is made to compensate for it on a day when there will be neither dinar nor dirham to deal with. Instead, if he has a good deed in his account it will be taken away from him and given to the person he had wronged. And if he has no good deeds in his account, sins of the other person will be taken from him and added to his account\" (al-Bukhari). Accordingly, the repentant can escape the questioning only by either giving back to the people wronged their due or seeking their forgiveness. If they forgive, he need not worry, but if they do not, then he must return their dues. And Allah knows best.\n",

Al-Khiraqi (rahimahullah) said: \"If it (nisaab al-zakaat) is reached then a quarter of 1/10 is due upon it and upon whatever exceeds it, no matter how small.\" Ibn Qadama (rahimahullah) in explaining this statement said: \"Meaning that if the amount of silver has reached 200 (which is the nisaab of silver in dirhams as has been discussed in question # 64) and the dinars 20 (which is the nisaab for gold in the units of mathaqeel [ see also question #64]) then one is obligated to pay zakaat upon it one quarter of 10 percent, as this has been established by his (the Prophet's , peace be upon him) saying 'for silver, one fourth of one tenth' \" (Al-Mughni ma'a al-sharh il-kabeer, 2/600) As for the meaning of the rest of the statement that what exceeds the nisaab no matter how small, it means that 1/4 of 1/10 (i.e. 2.5%) is also due upon this surplus difference. Thus, the overall meaning is that if monetary wealth surpasses the amount of nisaab, then zakaat is due upon it all, and not upon the surplus only, nor upon the amount of nisaab only, but on the total. Note that zakaat must be paid on the excess amount over nisaab, regardless of how small. This is the opinion taken by Malik and al-Shaafi'i and jumhoor al-ulemaa'. (see the source quoted above)\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah).al-hamdu lillah (all praise be to Allah). The Christians and the Jews of the People of the Book in our times are indeed those People of the Book that are mentioned in the texts of shari'ah in the Qur'an and sunnah, and they are the kuffar (unbelievers) of the Jews and Christians that existed at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). They are the people of the corrupted Torah and corrputed Injeel, as evidenced by the fact that Allah (swt) addressed them and named them \"People of the Book\" despite their being kuffar and their books being corrupted, as indicated in the following interpretations of the meanings of the aayaat: Aala 'imran: 70: O People of the Book! why do you reject the Signs of Allah, of which you are (yourselves) witnesses? Al-maa'ida: 15: O People of the Book! there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much that you used to hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There has come to you from Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book. Al-hashr: 2: (in regards to the Battle of Bani al-Nadeer): It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces) These kuffar among the People of the Book have certain abrogating qualities distinguishing them from the rest of the kuffar, by virtue of the fact that they are recipients of heavenly guidance and are people of previously revealed divine bookseven though they corrupted themunlike the remainder of the kuffar who have neither a previous book nor messenger, such as the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the communists, and others. Because of this distinguishing quality, the shari'ah has specified special rulings particular to the People of the Book, and exceptions specific to them in some rulings, such as allowing marriage to the the chaste and virtuous (whether virgins or previously married) among their women and the permissibility of eating their slaughtered meat, as indicated in the following ayah (interpretation of the meaning): Maa'ida: 5 This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues The preceding discussion is in regards to the general ruling with respect to slaughtered meat of the People of the Book; as for the specifics, the slaughtered meat of People of the Book can be one of several cases: That he slaughters it via the known way specified by shari'ah and he speaks the name of Allah upon it. In this case there is no problem in the permissibility of eating it. That he does not slaughter it by the way specified by shari'ah as is the case if he chokes it or electrocutes it until it dies or drowns it in water until it dies or kills it by a bullet, etc. In this case there is no doubt that eating it is forbidden since it is maita (meat of an animal that has died without properly being slaughtered) and Allah has forbidden it in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning): \" and forbidden unto you is maita\" (al-Maa'ida:3) That he mentions the name of someone or something other than Allah upon it as he is slaughtering, such as the Messiah or otherwise. Likewise there is no doubt that the meat in this case is haraam, since it is among what has been dedicated to other than Allah, which is specifically forbidden in the ayah in surat al-Maa'ida: 3 (interpretation of the meaning): \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: maita, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has ben invoked the name of other than Allah; that which has been killed by strangling or by a violent blow\" That we receive their meat and we don't know if it has been slaughtered properly or not. In this case the rule of thumb is that if we don't know the way of slaughter, the default is that it is permitted if it has been slaughtered by Muslims or Ahl il-Kitaab (Fatawa Islamiyya, Sheikh Abdel-Aziz Bin Baz, 3/404), as per the generally encompassing ayah (interpretation of the meaning) \"and the food of the people to whom have been revealed the Book is permitted for you.\" (al-Maa'ida:5) If it becomes evident to us that they have not slaughtered it properly then it would not be permisible. That we receive their meat and we don't know what they have mentioned upon it, and in this case likewise the preferrable and recommended opinion is the permissibility of eating it, as per the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari via Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the Prophet (peace be upon him) that a people come to them with meat which they do not know whether they have mentioned the name of Allah upon it or not. The Prophet replied \"Mention the name of Allah upon it and eat it.\"\n",

      "Contents Related Can you marry your cousin? Should marrying cousins be the last resort? Praise be to Allah.Can you marry your cousin? There is no objection whatsoever in the Islamic religion for a man to marry any of his relatives except al-maharim (those forbidden for marriage ) whom Allah mentioned in Surat Al-Nisa, 4:23 (interpretation of the meaning): “Prohibited to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers (who breast-fed you), foster-sisters (who breast-fed from the same woman as you); your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives with whom you have consummated marriage, no prohibition if ye have not consummated; (those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” Thus, when Allah mentioned for us the relatives to whom marriage is forbidden, we then come to know that there is no objection for the remainder of the family relations. Should marrying cousins be the last resort? Furthermore, there is no condition that it be the last resort as indicated in the question. Among the most prominent evidence of this fact is that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married his daughter Fatimah to ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) and he is the son of her father's uncle, as well as the marriage of the Prophet himself to Zainab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) and she is his aunt's daughter (i.e. his cousin); and there are many other such examples. However, a different question may be asked, namely: \"Is it better or preferable for a Muslim to marry someone he is not related to rather than a relative?\" The answer to this question varies from case to case, and perhaps it may be preferable to marry people who are non-relations, for example if one aspires to form new social ties or bonds, and regards the existence of a marriage relationship with a different family as constructive in widening the circle of social bonds.

      "Praise be to Allah.And peace and blessings be on His Prophet. Smoking is one of the things which has caused a lot of problems and harm these days and it has spread like wild fire. Before we discuss this topic in detail, we should know that Allaah the Almighty has divided things in the world into two types, good or permissible (al-tayyibaat, al-halaal) and evil or prohibited (al-khabaa'ith, al-haraam), and there is no third type. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning) in surat al-A'raaf (7:157): \"And He makes good things halaal for them and bad things haraam.\" Considering this fact, smoking can either be permissible and good or prohibited and evil. Thus, we present some of its characteristics and let the person asking the question see himself in which type lies smoking. There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for health. It is one of the major causes of lung cancer and other diseases. It is also one of the major causes of death. Since, it is known that the Islamic law prohibits everything that is harmful for a human being. Allah said (interpretation of meaning): \"Do not kill yourself. Allah is Merciful unto you.\" (Surat al-Nisaa' 4:29) In addition, His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"There is no harm or causing of harm (in Islaam).\" (Arabic \"laa darar wa laa diraar\") He (peace and blessings be upon him) also said: \"A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ... his body as to what he engaged it in.\" Smoking also goes against the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): \"Your body has a right on you.\" There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for the health of others who inhale the polluted breath of the smoker. Medical research has proven the harmful effects of smoking mothers on their children. The offensive smell caused by smoking is a source of pain to the worshippers of Allah among humans and angels. The angels are offended and suffer from the same things that the human beings suffer from. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): \"Those who cause harm to believing men and women without any reason do a great sin.\" (Surat al-Ahzaab, 33:58) The money that is spent on cigarettes is used on buying a harmful thing and is therefore an extravagance. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): \"… and do not be extravagant wasters. Those who are extravagant are kinsmen of Satan.\" (Surat al-Israa' 17:26-27) Extravagance (in Islam) means spending on something haraam. Spending money on cigarettes is a waste of resources as well. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ..... what he owned as to how he spent it.\" Considering all that has been presented, it can be clearly seen that smoking is an evil among many others. It is not permissible to indulge in it, or buy and sell it, or even to offer it to others. It is incumbent on a person who is addicted to it that he must make all efforts and get whatever necessary treatment to stop it. If the unbelievers have understood the harm caused by smoking and made laws regarding it, the Muslims should be even more eager to stop it and treat those who are addicted to it. We ask Allah the Almighty to cure everyone indulging in this evil and help him in giving it up. Allah is the Best Guide to the Right Path.\n",

      "Contents Related A message of thanks How to embrace Islam The meaning of the shahadah Convert to Islam NOW before it is too late Is dating haram in Islam? How to approach a woman for marriage in Islam Praise be to Allah.A message of thanks Respected questioner (may Allah protect you from every evil), Please accept from me a well-intentioned greeting! I commend and appreciate your wise and mature sense of judgment in supporting your friend's decision to accept Islam. It shows admirable wisdom and a balanced sense of sagacity and understanding of this blessed event. How to embrace Islam Regarding the procedure for embracing the religion of Islam, it is actually an extremely simple process, without complication or prolongment. This is because it is something between a person and his Lord and there are no other parties involved. All that is required of a person in order to embrace Islam is that he or she pronounces the two testaments of belief in the Islamic creed, believing in their meaning, then to take a complete bath with the intention of (ritual) purification in order to start performing prayers (note to ensure complete cleanliness one should shave pubic and under-arm hair, and a man should be circumcized if he is not already--Islam places great emphasis on proper hygiene and personal cleanliness). The meaning of the shahadah As for the two testimonies of creed, the first is \"ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah\" (I testify that there is no deity other than Allah), which means that one believes and confirms that there is nothing to be worshipped other than Allah and that one is prepared to implement His divine rulings and guidelines (Shari`ah) for all aspects of life. The second is \"ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasool ullah\" which means the belief that Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the seal of the prophets (i.e. the final one), whom Allah has sent with the Islamic religion to supercede all other previous religions and that it is obligatory to comply with what he has enjoined, and to abstain and renounce all that he has prohibited and restrained. Convert to Islam NOW before it is too late I tend to gather from your question that there is a degree of pondering on your part or inclination towards embracing the Islamic religion, joining the example of your friend. I would invite you to carry through with it without excessive delay and reluctance , for one does not know when one's fate will come. So why not meet one's unavoidable fate as a believer in Allah (God) and the Hereafter, a member of the religion of Islam? It is the religion which Allah has specified that He will not accept any other religion besides it, and He will not save anyone from Hell besides its followers. Undoubtedly, this step will be the greatest thing that you will ever have experienced in your life. Surely you will not regret it at all and Allah will help you to surmount the difficulties you perhaps may face in your path after accepting Islam, such as the scorn of some relatives or family members or the alientation of some friends. However, the step in fulfilling your destiny is much more important and significant than all this. We pray for you to be bestowed with grace, and may Allah guide you to success. Waiting for glad tidings in the near future, may Allah guard and protect you. For more about the pillars of Islam, please see this answer: 13569 Is dating haram in Islam? I was extremely pleased to receive your questions regarding the nature of the relationship between men and women in Islam. Regarding the issue of dating in Islam , one must first define what is meant by \"dating.\" If dating is understood to mean how a man and a woman get to know each other for the purpose of marriage, then there are certain guidelines and established procedures which can be discussed. However, if dating is understood to refer to casual relationships between men and women for the purpose of \"fun\" or \"going out\" and such, then there is no provision for this in Islam. Such a situation is not considered respectful for either the man or the woman, nor is it constructive for the concept or the building of the family or society or social responsibility. Opening the door to relationships of love and infatuation and passion and pre-marital sex is categorically prohibited in Islam. It does not lead to the establishment of a family nor to proper and virtuous upbringing of children nor to stability and mutual care and tranquility and peace of mind between a man and woman. Rather, dating leads to disorder, the disgracing of one's honor and dignity, and to a lifestyle similar to that of animals, and to that of illegitimate children who are subjected to a life of vagrancy and loss. (Please see question # 61 which addresses the issue of prohibition of pre-marital relationships). How to approach a woman for marriage in Islam As for the former case, regarding how a man and a woman come to know each other for the purpose of marriage , it varies from circumstance to circumstance. Normally if a man has the desire to marry and has the ability to accept the responsibility, and he does not have anyone in mind, he will ask his friends, family, and relatives if there is a lady that may be suitable for him and his expectations among their acquaintances and relatives. If someone is suggested, he normally asks about her extensively, about her religious observance, her personality, her knowledge, strengths, weaknesses, suitability as a wife willing to accept all the relevant responsibilities, etc. If preliminary information seems appealing, then normally she is told that there is someone interested in meeting her and she is likewise given relevant information about him. At this point, assuming the man and the woman as well as both families involved agree that there is potential, then the man usually visits the woman's family, often accompanied by members of his own. They are given the opportunity to see each other and sit and talk together, to converse modestly (but not in complete solitude) regarding whatever is relevant to making an informed judgment. The intention for this meeting should be for them to be able to make a decision whether or not they feel they are mutually suitable. Afterwards, they each evaluate their own and their families' reactions, and pray to Allah that He guides them to what is in their best interest, and to make them accept the outcome. When both sides feel comfortable and feel they know everything they need to, based on all that has been mentioned such as asking about the other person, knowing their family, meeting in person, etc., they can make a final decision whether to carry on with marriage or not. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is absolutely not permissible under any circumstances in Islamic law (shari'a) of Allah, the most esteemed and exhalted, for a non-Muslim to marry a Muslim woman, as per what He has said regarding the marriage of a kafir (unbeliever) to a Muslim woman and vice versa: (interpretation of the meaning). They are not lawful (wives) for the unbelievers, nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them... (Al-Mumtahina:10) And Allah the most esteemed and exhalted has also said (interpretation of the meaning): Nor marry (your girls) to unbelievers until they believe... (Al-Baqara:221) i.e., it is not ever permissable for someone to marry his Muslim daughter or sister or any Muslim woman for whom he is a guardian to a kafir. Islam must be exhalted and cannot be subjugated, so how could a Muslim woman be put under the care of a kafir man, when the man is normally naturally in a stronger position? In such a situation he could cause her to corrupt the practice of her religion or force her into subdual by causing her to live a life of oppression with him. He could also prevent her from practicing some of her religious rites.

If a woman becomes a Muslima and her husband is a kaafir, then it becomes mandatory for her to separate from him and it is not permissible for her to remain with him in his state of shirk (disbelief), as per Allah's injunction (interpretation of the meaning): \" do not send them back to the disbelieversthey are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them\" (Al-Mumtahinah 60:10). It is her duty to invite him to Islam and to attempt to convince him via various approaches in the hope that Allah may accept her efforts and give her the great reward for his guidance through her. The prophet (peace be upon him) once told Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) when he sent him to a people who were idol-worshippers: \"Invite them to Islam and inform them what is required of them, for (I swear) by Allah, that Allah guides a man through you is better than if you had humr un-na'am (a particular kind of camel which is the most sought-after wealth among the Arabs)\" (Al-Bukhari, Fath il-Baari 3009). As for the course of the marriage, and what she should do if her husband accepts Islam or doesn't, Ibn ul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy upon him) said: What is indicated by evidence of his (i.e., the prophet's) ruling is that the marriage is mawqoof, or in abeyance (i.e. suspension); if her husband accepts Islam before the elapsing of her 'iddah (waiting period), then she remains his wife. If her 'iddah elapses then she has the right to marry whom she pleases or if she likes she may wait (in the hope he may still accept Islam). If he then accepts Islam, she becomes his wife without need of renewing the marriage. (Zaad ul-Ma'aad, Vol 5 p.138). wallahu a'lam.

      "Praise be to Allah.The pronunciation and spelling of the word which is closest to the Arabic pronunciation is Ramadhaan. The month of Ramadhaan for this Hijrah year 1418H is expected to commence on 30 or 31 December 1997, as will be established by sighting of the moon. Allah has said in surat al-Baqarah, 2:189 (interpretation of the meaning): \"They ask you [O Muhammad ] about the new moons. Tell them they are signs for people to mark fixed periods of time and for the pilgrimage...\" so that they may fix their times of worship and other appointments.

Dear brothers: As-salaamu alaikum wa-rahamat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh, I ask Allah ta'ala that this message finds you all in good health and that He brings you success in all that is good. Before answering your most recent question, the following point must be made clear: Performing the duties of a mufti, a judge, an imam, a khateeb, or a mu'adhin is considered a duty of shari'ah, associated with the Hereafter, which must be rooted in one's volunteering and seeking the reward from Allah. It is not a worldly employment for profit or attaining income, and thus one cannot apply the principle of identifying a remuneration or compensation for specifically defined duties as one would do in the case of a worldly employment contract. If one cannot find those who are willing to volunteer to fill these duties without compensation, then it is permissible to arrange a payment for he who will execute these tasks and free himself up for them, since his duties as an imam or judge or mufti or similar functions may occupy his time such that he may not find the opportunity to gain his income through other means. Note that this payment is appointed for him for the purpose of freeing him up for his duties vis-a-vis shari'ah, and it is NOT a \"fee for hire\", i.e. NOT a salary compensating for work done. Thus, the correct case is that he accepts money so that he can be free to make fataawa (for a mufti), NOT that he makes fataawa so that he can make money; likewise, he accepts money so that he can be free to be an imam, NOT that he works as an imam so as to make money, etc. Both the correct and invalid cases are a means to an end; what makes one correct and the other invalid is what comprises the means and what comprises the end. The accepting of money must be the means, i.e. an instrument, aiding a person to the end, which is to establish and conduct acts of worship and pleasing Allaah, and to free himself up for this. Acts of worship cannot be the means to the end of achieving an income. Now we come to your question regarding giving the imam a portion of the zakaat which he is gathering for the purpose of the charitable project. This suggestion is based on the fact that he is among those who administer the funds, a category mentioned in the aayah regarding eligible parties that may receive from the zakaat funds. This category must be identified by its definition according to shari'ah, and it is: those officials appointed by the khalifah of the Muslims and their Imam for collecting zakaat, keeping account of it, guarding it, and distributing it among those who deserve it. Among the prerequisites required of those who collect zakaat are: that they are Muslim; that they are respected and trusted and don't betray; that they are reliable, trustworthy, and impartial, not inclined to favor anyone; fair and not liable to deal unjustly; knowledgeable in the required Islamic fiqh, aware of what is to be taken and what is not; disciplined and able to perform the duties. It is permissible for to give such persons a compensation from the zakaat itself or a salary from bait ul-maal from other funds. However, the official cannot take anything from the zakaat other than what the imam gives him, nor is he allowed to accept any gifts from those from whom he is collecting zakaat, as has been indicated by authentic ahaadeeth. If there is no khalifah of the Muslims to appoint those who will collect the zakaat or the khalifah has not sent someone to collect it (in a particular, perhaps remote, location), it becomes an obligation upon those who have wealth to pay it themselves and distribute it to those who deserve it. Further, the venerable Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baaz has given us a fatwah indicating that it is permissible when necessary for the president of the Islamic center, or whoever is responsible for the matters of the Muslims, in non-Muslim countries, to appoint someone to collect zakaat and to give them an appropriate portion of it as a compensation, as they would be considered as among those employed to administer it. Important observation: If the person collecting zakaat is already receiving a salary from bait ul-maal such as a judge (qaadi), mufti, imam, etc., then he does not receive anything (additional) from the zakaat because he already has an income taken from bait ul-maal. In addition, the duties of anyone in such a position includes general work for the good of the Muslims (see Al-Mughni ma'al-Sharh al-Kabeer, Vol 7, p. 319, and al-Majmoo' lil-Nawawi, Vol 6, p.188). If what he receives does not cover his needs then he would be classified as being among the poor (al-fuqaraa'), and thus would be entitled to be given enough to meet his needs. Note, again, that he should not take anything himself unilaterally, so as not to compromise his impartiality and sincerity. And Allah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is best most correct.\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) \"not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)\" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of this issue in question #61) As for your statement: \"I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,\" by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): \"You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred\" We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider them carefully. Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worship per of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissable and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah: Every Muslim has to implement Islamic law, with all possible means, in all affairs, being social, economical, etc., in accordance with the verse: (interpretation of the meaning) \"Say: My prayer, my sacrifice, my life and my death are for Allah\". On certain occasions Muslims may be ruled by a non-Islamic system, which makes it very difficult for them to practice their religion. Their example may be similar to that predicted by the prophet, (peace be upon him): \" There will come a day where a Muslim holding fast to his deen (religion) is like he who is gripping a hot coal\" (Al-Tirmidhi, sahih). When a Muslim is faced with such a situation, he should hold fast to the teachings of the Qur'an, keep himself within a good Muslim community, and strive his best to implement Islam, asking Allah's forgiveness for things he could not implement. Allah, the Merciful, has stated that (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allah does not require from a soul more than what it can bear\". When the situation becomes too difficult and over-bearing, a Muslim enters in a state of \"adversity\" or \"necessity\" (al-dharoorah) where unlawful things (al-mahdhooraat) become permissible. This is a great rule in Islam which reflects its mercy and appreciation to its followers. However, this issue is very sensitive as many Muslims, out of their ignorance, mistreat this rule. For example they neglect the corollary which says: \"The state of necessity should be dealt with in proportion to its measure.\" Therefore it is very important to mention the constraints and conditions under which the rule of necessity is applicable. Some of these are: That the level of harm associated with the unlawful action be less than that caused by the state of dharoorah. That the permissible degree or amount of the unlawful action he is allowed to commit be just enough to get him out of the state of dharoorah. That there is no other alternative in facing the state of dharoorah other than committing the unlawful act. That the duration of the concession be restricted to the duration of its cause. That the dharoorah is actually existing and not only anticipated or expected. When someone is faced by dharoorah and all its conditions and constraints are observed then the unlawful thing becomes lawful to him. Here are few practical examples to illustrate the above: It is permissible for the Muslim to eat from the dead animal if he finds nothing halaal to eat, and he will die if he doesn't eat It is permissible for a Muslim to utter the words of kufr (disbelief) when he is under a painful torturing that he cannot bear. It is permissible to deposit the money at the banks to save them from being lost or stolen, although that is considered to be helping the banks in their haraam interest transactions. It is permissible to enroll in car insurance (considering that most of the forms of car insurance are not acceptable in Islam) if he is in bad need to have a car and he is not allowed to drive one without insurance. It is permissible to complain to the \"civil courts\" (although they may not be implementing the Islamic law) to obtain one's rights if they is no other means to do so, provided one has the sound belief that there is no judgment except that of Allah. Since the question inquires about transactions in particular, it is worth noting the following: It is never permissible to ask for riba nor to accept it under any circumstances. Such unlawful action is not permissible under any need. Minimizing the risk, or having more convenience are not valid excuses to enter into unlawful contracts, like those involving riba. Improving the income or promoting the profits are also not valid excuses to adopt unlawful ways of earning. Let's remember that a little blessed halaal earning is better than many folds of haraam earning. Finally we have to say that it is the duty of Muslims everywhere to strive to find lawful alternatives to alleviate the state of dharoorah and save themselves from the need to adopt unlawful ways. We ask Allah to give us of His bounties what keeps us sufficed and satisfied, and not to make us in need of anyone other than Him. Ameen.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Paying visits by Muslim men to cemeteries is a practice of the sunnah, and it reminds one of his destiny so that he may strive for it. As the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"I [once] had forbid you from visiting graves, [and I now enjoin] you to do so, so that the visit may serve as a beneficial reminder.\" (related by Muslim and others) and in the version of al-Haakim: \" for [such visits] soften the heart, bring tears to the eyes, and serve as a reminder of the Hereafter, [but be careful] not to speak forbidden expressions [i.e. while visiting].\" (Sahih al-Jaami' 4584) Concerning visits to cemeteries by women, scholars have varied opinions on this issue: it is allowed or preferred and their case is similar to that of men it is makrooh (reprehensible), which is the opinion of jumhoor ul-'ulemaa' (the majority of the scholars) it is forbidden, this one probably being the strongest opinion, as indicated by al-hadith al-sahih in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"Allaah has cursed women who frequent graves,\" related by Ahmed and Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah and in one version, \"Allaah has cursed women who visit graves and those who build mosques and place lights upon them.\" (related by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaa'i and al-Haakim) This condemnation would warrant the validity of the argument against women visiting cemeteries as the lawmaker (i.e. Allaah) would not condemn something that is permissible or reprehensibleonly that which is forbidden completely. Regarding what would be the reason for this condemnation, the scholars have cited two main arguments: Firstly, that women for the most part are emotionally weaker in accepting calamities and perhaps being in sight of her dear one's graves may break into wailing and loud weeping, which would be detrimental to her religious character and harmful for her body as well. Secondly, cemeteries are oftentimes isolated places which may not be safe for someone being alone, possibly exposing a woman to people of corrupt or loose moral character. In summary, the rationale behind this prohibition is that women are often not as strong emotionally in the face of calamities, and not visiting graves prevents them from the trial and from being exposed to unnecessary fitnah.

Ash'had said: Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy upon him) was asked regarding naming someone the name Gibreel he abhorred it and it didn't please him; Judge 'ayaad said: \"... and others allowed it.\" Abdul-Razzak said in al-Jaami' via Ma'mar: \"I said to Hammaad ibn Abi Sulaiman what would you say regarding a man whose name is Gibreel or Mikaa'eel, and he responded, 'There is no objection.' (laa ba's bi-hi)\" Regarding the hadeeth: \"laa tusammow bi-asmaa' il-malaa'ikah\" (\"don't name yourselves with the names of the angels\"), al-Bukhari has said that the validity of its chain of narration is questionable. This means that the hadith would not be considered sahih. (\"Tuhfat il-Mawdood,\" p. 83) In al-Mawsoo'ah al-Fiqhiyya most of the scholars have ruled that using the names of the angels like Gibreel and Mikaa'eel is not makrooh (disagreeable or reprehensible). Maalik, on the other hand, has ruled that it is makrooh. (al-Mawsoo'ah al-Fiqhiyya, al-Kuwait, Vol 11/p.334) Some have stated that the meaning of Gibreel is Abdullah and likewise Mikaa'eel. See Tafseer Ibn Katheer under aayaat numbers 97-98 in Surat il-Baqarah. Thus, based on what has been presented, it is preferable not to use the names of the angels, and that we follow the rightly-guided forefathers in the naming of our children and in the naming of those who accept Islam among the non-believers.

It is mandatory that a divorced woman stay in her husband's home during the period of iddah (specifically after the first and second divorce). It is not permissible for her husband to force her out of the home. The verse from the Qur'an which asserts this is al-Talaaq (65:1), (interpretation of the meaning): \"... and do not force them out of their homes, nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in the case where they are guilty of open illegal sexual intercourse...\" The husband is also obliged to provide for her during this period of iddah, as she is still under his guardianship ('isma). It is permissible for the woman to beautify herself for her husband during the iddah. In fact, one of the reasons for iddah is to provide a period of reflection and contemplation, so each party may consider the consequences and review the decisions and circumstances, so as to provide a chance for them to get back together. If the husband abandons the house or forces the wife out, then the reasons for which Allah has ordained this period have been missed. Thus, it is incumbent upon the husband to beware of this, as he would be disobeying a command from Allah. There is nothing wrong with her going out of the house for visits, etc., with his permission, just as before her divorce. Regarding the length of the iddah, please refer to question #31.

Neither does a dress that is transparent and displays skin complexion, nor a tight dress that shows the size, shape or bends of the `awrah. All of this is prohibited (haraam) in front of people whether the women are ashamed of looking at it or not (as asked in the question). If the trousers (or pants) are wide enough and not tight, then one may tuck his shirt in it as long as it does not display his `awrah. Covering the `awrah is obligatory during the prayer and outside it. What many people do is cover their `awrah while going to prayer but are negligent of it outside the prayer.

The Antichrist (Al-Dajjal) The Dajjal – a man created by Allah, who will appear at the end of time because of something that makes Allah angry. He will spread corruption on earth and will claim divinity, calling on people to worship him. People will be tested by the extraordinary powers that Allah will grant him, such as causing rain to fall, reviving the earth with vegetation and extracting the treasures of the earth. The Antichrist will be a young man with a ruddy complexion, short of stature, with curly hair. He will be one-eyed; his right eye will be flat and his other eye will have a thick piece of flesh over it. Written between his eyes will be the word “Kafir” (disbeliever). Most of those who follow him will be Jews. He will meet his end at the hands of ‘Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary) who will kill him with a spear in Lod, which is in Palestine. Gog and Magog Yajuj and Majuj are two disbelieving tribes from among the sons of Adam. They have wide faces and small eyes. They used to spread mischief on earth, so Allah gave Dhu’l-Qarnayn the power to build a barrier to detain them. They will keep on digging at it until Allah gives them permission to come out at the end of time, after ‘Isa (peace be upon him) has killed the Dajjal. Gog and Magog will emerge in huge numbers and will drink up the lake of Tiberias (in Palestine). They will spread mischief on earth and no one will be able to resist them. Jesus (peace be upon him) and the believers with him will take refuge in Mount Tur until Allah destroys Yajuj and Majuj by sending worms that will eat their necks. Then Allah will send rain to wash away their bodies into the sea and cleanse the earth of their stench. The Beast Al-Dabbah is a great creature which Allah will cause to emerge when the people become corrupt. It will speak to mankind and exhort them, having the ability to reason and speak. It will make marks on the people’s noses which will distinguish the believers from the disbelievers. (For more, please see Ashrat al-Sa’ah by Yusuf al-Wabil or al-Qiyamah al-Kubra by ‘Umar al-Ashqar).

Thirdly, a Muslim should be clever and sagacious in choosing the appropriate words and gentle-mannered approach to inform such a kind person of the place where one can buy \"halaal\" meat. Since he is already spending money on the meat whether he buys Islamically-slaughtered meat or otherwise, your guiding him to the appropriate place preserves the benefits and interests from all facets, i.e.: not refusing his gift; and achieving the permissibility of eating the meat. In fact, it would be a wise idea even for the meat he buys for himself and his house, as it will be better and healthier. Perhaps you could approach him with the idea as a suggestion and not as a firm requirement, explaining to him the reasons behind it both from the point of view of the Islamic shari'ah as well as health reasons. Thus, it would not be something you are presenting as forcing your opinion upon him; rather, you would express the importance of the issue for you, while at the same time complimenting and praising him for his generosity, expressing your embarrassment for having opened the subject.

      "Praise be to Allah.Among what the Islamic shari’ah asserts is the binding and coupling of the testimony of oneness for Allah and the testimony of the calling and message of prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Examples of such linking are in the adhan for salaat and in the iqaamah for it. Additionally, in a hadith the prophet (peace be upon him) teaches: “Islam was built upon five pillars: to witness that there is no deity except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah… .” It represents what a mukallaf (one who is legally capable, liable for one’s actions, and obliged to perform required acts, which in Islamic law, shari’ah, starts at puberty) is required to believe. It must be understood together, and are pronounced together as a testimony of belief. As for writing it interwoven, nothing is available neither in the Book of Allah nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). As a result, there is great danger in this. For it has a resemblance to the false precept in the Christian faith of trinity, and the concept that the father and the son and the holy spirit are one deity. Further, it could be construed as an emblem representing the false faith of the unity of existence. In addition, it may be used as support for the extremism in the Prophet and worshipping him with Allah. Therefore, writing the name of Allah (the Most High) with the name of his prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this way, i.e. making the letters of their names interwoven and the crossing of the letters of each of their names with the other, must be prevented. It is even not permissible to write (Allah - Muhammad) on the door of the masjid, nor in other locations, due to the confusion, misrepresentation, and serious concerns described and warned of above.\n",

      "Contents Related Meaning of “la ilaha illa Allah” Meaning of “Muhammad Rasul Allah” Praise be to Allah.Meaning of “la ilaha illa Allah” Bearing witness “la ilaha illa Allah” and that “Muhammadun Rasul Allah” is the first pillar of the five pillars of Islam. And the meaning of “la ilaha illa Allah” is that nothing worshipped is worthy of worship except Allah—it is simultaneously a denial and affirmation. “la ilaha” is denial of all worship other than that of Allah. “illa Allah” is affirmation that all worship is for Allah Alone without partners. Meaning of “Muhammad Rasul Allah” As for the declaration, “Muhammadun Rasul Allah ,” its meaning is the assertion of the message of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and to believe in it and to adhere to it by speech, action and faith, and to avoid all that is against it, whether it be sayings, actions, or intentions. In other words, obeying him in what he ordered and believing in what he said and relayed and avoiding what he has forbidden and denounced and not worshipping Allah except as he has ordained. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If the condition of those with whom you live is as you mentioned, appealing for help from other than Allah, such as appealing for help from the dead and the non-living or the trees or stones or planets and the like, then they are committing the greatest shirk which causes expulsion from the community and faith of Islam. It is not allowed to ally with them just as it is not permissible to ally with non-believers. Praying behind them is not valid. It is not allowed to mix socially with them nor to reside amongst them except for the one who calls them to the truth with knowledge, and sees hope that they will accept and that their religious condition will become correct due to his efforts. Otherwise, it becomes obligatory for him to abandon them and to join a different community in which he can work with on establishing the fundamentals of Islam and its branches and reviving the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him). If he is not able to find the proper community, he should seclude himself from all communities, even if he experiences harshness, as has been related by Huthaifa (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The people used to ask the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) about goodness. And I used to ask him about evil from fear of falling in it. So I said, O Messenger of Allah, we used to be in ignorance and evil but Allah gave us this goodness, so is there evil after this goodness? He said: “Yes”. So I said is their goodness after this evil? He said “Yes and it has some darkness” I said what is its darkness? He said: “A people following an example other than my example and calling to a guidance other than my guidance; you would agree with some of what they do and disagree with some.” So, I said is there any evil after that goodness? He said: “Yes, callers on the doors of Jahanam (the Hellfire); whoever answers their call to it are thrown in it.” So, I said: O Messenger of Allah describe them to us. He said: “They are from amongst us and they speak with our tongues” I said: O Messenger of Allah, what do you command me to do if this happens in my time. He said: “Adhere to the community of Muslims and their leader.” So, I said: What if there weren’t a community of Muslims nor a leader? He said: “Then seclude yourself from all the communities, even if you were to bite on the root of a tree until death” Mutafaqun alayh (lit. agreed upon, i.e. narrated by both Muslim and Bukhari). Blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Mohammed, his family and companions.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) \"not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)\" (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of this issue in question #61) As for your statement: \"I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,\" by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): \"You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred\" We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider them carefully. Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worshipper of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissible and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If the building you describe was intended as a mosque, and the people on the higher and lower floors can hear the voice of the Imaam, then the prayer of all of them is valid. In this case it is not permissible for menstruating women to sit in the place that is prepared for prayer in the lower level, because it is part of the mosque. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I do not make the mosque permissible for menstruating women and those in a state of ritual impurity.” As for a menstruating woman passing through the mosque for some purpose, as long as she takes care to ensure that no blood leaks, then there is nothing wrong with this, because Allâh says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Approach not As-Salaah (the prayer)… when you are in a state of Janaabah (i.e., when you are in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath) except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or when passing through a mosque)…” [al-Nisa’ 4:43] And it was reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told ‘Aa’ishah to fetch his prayer rug from the mosque, and she said that she was menstruating. He SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told her: “Your menstruation is not in your hand.” But if it was not the intention of those who established this mosque that the lower floor was to be part of the mosque, but it was to be a storeroom or to serve some other purpose, as mentioned in the question, then it does not come under the rulings governing mosques. It is permissible for menstruating woman and those who are in a state of impurity to sit there. There is nothing wrong with praying there in the places that are pure (taahir) and are not part of the washrooms, as it is permissible to pray in all clean places where there is no shar’i reason not to pray. But anyone who prays there cannot be considered to be following the imaam who is praying on the upper floor, if he cannot see him or any of the people who are praying behind him, and because this is not a part of the mosque, according to the more correct scholarly opinion. With regard to the pillars which interrupt the rows, they do not adversely affect the prayer, but if it is possible to form the rows in front of or behind the pillars so that the row will not be interrupted, this is better. And Allaah is the source of strength.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This is one of two cases: either this man is ignorant and what he says is of no significance, or what he says is a fabrication and a lie. We Muslims know well the aayah (Qur’aanic verse) in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) (Deut, xviii 15) and the Injeel (Gospel) (John, xiv 16), — he commands them for Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful At‑Tayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al‑Khabaa’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaah’s Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Qur’aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful [al-A’raaf 7:157] Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse: “ ‘Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)’ – this is a description of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the books of the Prophets who gave their nations the glad tidings of his coming and commanded them to follow him. This description is still there in their books and their scholars and rabbis know it. Imaam Ahmad narrated: Ismaa’eel told us from al-Jareeri from Abu Sakhr al-‘Aqeeli, a man from among the Bedouin told me, I brought a milch-camel to Madeenah during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When I had sold her, I said, “Let me meet this man [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] and listen to him.” I met him walking between Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, and I followed them until they came to a Jewish man who was reading from a scroll of the Torah, consoling himself for the plight of his son who lay dying, a boy who was very handsome and good looking. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘I ask you by the One Who revealed this Torah, do you find any mention in this book of yours of my attributes and my coming?’ The man gestured with his head to indicate ‘No’. But his son said, ‘Yes indeed, by the One who revealed the Torah, we do find mention of your attributes and your coming in our book, and I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that you are the Messenger of Allaah.’ [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, ‘Keep this Jew away from your brother.’ Then he took care of shrouding him and praying [the funeral prayer] over him.” This is a qawiy jayyid hadeeth. It was narrated that ‘Ataa’ ibn Yassaar said: “I met ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr and said, ‘Tell me about the attributes of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described in the Torah.’ He said, ‘Yes, by Allaah he is described in the Torah as he is described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner” [al-Fath 48:8] – and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger; your name is al-Mutawakkil; you are not harsh and aggressive; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.’” ‘Ataa’ said: “Then I met Ka’b (who was one of the People of the Book who had become Muslim) and I asked him about that, and he told me exactly the same, not even one letter was different…” Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that ‘Ataa’ ibn Yassaar said: “ I met ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him) and said, ‘Tell me about the description of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Torah. He said, ‘‘Yes, by Allaah, he is described in the Torah in some of the same terms as he is described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner” [al-Fath 48:8] – and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger; your name is al-Mutawakkil; he is not harsh and aggressive, and he does not make a noise in the market-place; he does not repay evil with evil, rather he overlooks and forgives; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes.’” (al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2125) Allaah did not send any Prophet without taking from him the covenant and promise that if the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) were to appear during his lifetime, he would follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah says in Soorat Aal ‘Imraan (which no Christian reads with an open mind but he will become Muslim) (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allaah said: ‘Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).’” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:81] Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse: It is said that Allaah took the covenant from the Prophets that they would confirm one another, and He commanded them to believe in one another. This is the meaning of believing and helping (‘you must, then, believe in him and help him’)… Taawoos said: Allaah took the covenant from the first Prophets that they would believe in the Message of the later Prophets… The Messenger here is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), according to the view of ‘Ali and Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them). Allaah took the covenant from all the Prophets that they would believe in Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if they met him, and He commanded them to take the same covenant from their nations. If you want to know more about the references to the coming of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Bible (even after it has been altered!) we refer you to the books “Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Bible” and “What the Bible says about Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)” by Ahmad Deedat.

She should respond to this request what harm could it possibly do?

      "Praise be to Allah.the Lord of the Worlds, and peace and blessings be upon his truthful Prophet. Firstly, how can there be any such thing as bidah hasanah (good innovation) when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Every bidah is a going astray and every going astray is in Hell-fire. So, if anyone says that there is such a thing as bidah hasanah, he can only be insisting on going against the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Secondly, saying al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allaah) when coming out of rukoo is a well-known phrase of dhikr which is proven in sound ahaadeeth reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). All that this Sahaabi did was to come up with a new phrase expressing praise to Allaah. How can this be used as evidence to support innovations in worship and dhikr that have no basis in the sources of Islam? Thirdly, what this Sahaabi did cannot be taken as evidence in and of itself. It was not even considered to have been a correct action until after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had approved it, and not before. But how on earth could this innovator obtain the approval of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) after he has passed away?\" Fourthly, if we accept the use of this report as evidence, it is still no more than an isolated incident which cannot be generalized, whereas the hadeeth every bidah is a going astray is clearly a general statement. It is a well-known principle among the ulamaa (scholars) that what is stated clearly takes precedence over what is merely implied. Fifthly, how can we know what is good or not with our limited minds alone and without the input of Revelation? Is there not the possibility of differences of opinion? What one person sees as good will be seen differently by another, so what would the standard be? Whose reasoning could we rely on or refer to? Would this not be confusion, even anarchy itself? Sixthly (which confirms the third point made above), when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of an act of worship or a dhikr (remembrance of Allaah) on the part of one of his Sahaabah, it would thus become a part of shareeah and hence be regarded as a sunnah hasanah. But with the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the ceasing of Revelation, how can we know whether innovated acts of worship or dhikr are correct or would be approved? We have no way of knowing, so we should limit ourselves only to the forms of worship that have been narrated in sound reports. The great scholar al-Haafiz ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated many comments by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in Fath al-Baari; he agreed with some and disagreed with others. This is the business of the scholars: they discuss and debate with one another, with the aim of reaching the truth which may lie with the one who is disagreeing or with the one whose opinion is being criticized. As for the unpleasant comment quoted in the question, from what we know of Ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) and his good manners, fear of Allaah, awareness of the value of knowledge and respect for the scholars, we are sure that this comment is a fabrication. May Allaah forgive all the scholars and reward them for their efforts and concern.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is the Muslim’s duty to follow the truth and to join the victorious group, the people of Sunnah and Jamaa’ah (Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah) who are followers of the pious predecessors (al-salaf al-saalih), loving them for the sake of Allaah whether they are in his own country or elsewhere, and cooperating with them in righteousness. The attributes of the victorious group are related in a number of saheeh ahaadeeth, for example: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “My ummah is an ummah which carries out the commands of Allaah; those who let them down or differ from them do not harm them and they will keep adhering to this path until the Day of Judgement.” Mu‘aawiyah and ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with them) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ‘A group of my ummah will continue victoriously adhering to the truth until the Last Hour begins.’” Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu‘bah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) say: “Some people of my ummah will remain victorious over the people until the decree of Allaah reaches them.” ‘Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “A group of my ummah will continue fighting for the truth, and will prevail over those who oppose them, until the last of them will kill al-Maseekh al-Dajjaal (the Liar or Anti-Christ).” From these ahaadeeth we may understand the following: (1) The Prophet’s words “A group of my ummah will continue . . .” indicate that this is a section of the ummah, not the entire ummah. This also indicates that there will be other groups and sects. (2) His words “those who oppose them will not harm them” indicate that there will be other groups who oppose the victorious group in the way they practice the religion. This also concurs with the hadeeth which describes the ummah being divided into seventy-two groups or sects who oppose the one group that is following the truth. (3) Both ahaadeeth offer glad tidings to the people who are following the truth. The hadeeth that speaks of the victorious group speaks of their victory in this world. (4) The words “until the decree of Allaah reaches them” refer to the wind or breeze that will come and take the soul of every believing man and woman. This does not contradict the hadeeth “A group of my ummah will remain victoriously supporting the truth until the Day of Resurrection,” because that hadeeth means that they will continue to follow the truth until that gentle breeze takes their souls just before the Day of Resurrection, when many other Signs of the Last Hour have already manifested themselves. The characteristics of the victorious group From the ahaadeeth quoted above, and other reports, we can derive the following characteristics of the victorious group: (1) They follow the truth. They are described variously as “following the truth,” “following the commandments of Allaah,” “following the true religion,” etc. All of these phrases indicate that they are adhering to the true religion with which Muhammad (peace be upon him) was sent. (2) They obey the commandments of Allaah, which means: (a) They are distinguished from the rest of mankind by carrying the banner of Da’wah towards Allaah. (b) They undertake the mission of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. (3) They will be victorious until the Last Hour. The ahaadeeth say that “they will be victorious until the decree of Allaah comes,” “they victoriously support the truth,” or “they will be victorious over those who oppose them.” This victory includes: Being open and not hiding: they are well-known and prominent and have the upper hand. Adherence to true religion, righteousness, following Allaah’s commands and fighting against His enemies in jihaad Victory by defeating others (4) They are patient and resist others with patience. Abu Tha‘labah al-Khashani (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “After you there will come days of patience, in which the patience required will be like having to hold a burning coal in one’s hand.” Who are the people of the victorious sect? Al-Bukhaari said: “They are the people of knowledge (the scholars).” Many scholars said that the victorious group is the scholars of hadeeth. Al-Nawawi said: “It is possible that this group is scattered among all types of believers. Some may be brave fighters, or fuqahaa’, or scholars of hadeeth, or ascetics, or people who enjoin good and forbid evil, and other types of good people.” Al-Nawawi also said: “It could be a group of different types of believers, including those who are brave and skilled in warfare, faqeehs, scholars of hadeeth, Qur’aanic commentators (mufassireen), those who enjoin good and forbid evil, ascetics and devoted worshippers.” Ibn Hajar, may Allaah have mercy on him, explained the matter as follows: “They do not have to all be in one city; they could be gathered in one country or dispersed across the world. They may be gathered in one city or in a part of it. It is possible that one group may exist, then disappear, then be replaced by another group, and so on, until the Day of Judgement, when all will disappear except for one group in one city, who will disappear when the breeze decreed by Allaah comes.” The scholars’ discussion of this group does not specify one type of people, or one city or country, except for the last group, which will be in al-Shaam (the territory comprising modern-day Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine) and will fight the Dajjaal, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said. No doubt those who are involved with the sciences of sharee’ah – ‘aqeedah, fiqh, hadeeth and tafseer, studying and teaching – are the people who are most qualified to be called the Victorious Group, and they should be at the forefront of da’wah and jihaad, and enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and refuting the people of bid’ah, all of which must be accompanied with sound knowledge based on the Wahy (Revelation). We ask Allaah to make us among them. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars (jumhoor ul-'ulmeaa') assert that salaat ul-witr (witr prayer) is a sunnah mu'akkada (confirmed sunnah that the Prophet peace be upon him, practiced consistently), and that it is not obligatory. This is based on the hadith (saying) regarding the bedouin who once came to the Prophet asking about Islam, the Prophet answered, \"Five prayers within one day-and-night.\" The bedouin asked, \"Am I obliged to other than those?\" The Prophet replied, \"Unless you volunteer of your own.\" (al-hadith muttafaqun alaih.) Some scholars have said that qiyaam ul-layl (prayer at the heart of night) and salaat ul-witr are the best of the voluntary prayers (al-nawaafil). Therefore, one should consistently practice them and not neglect them. The Prophet did not neglect the prayers during night nor two rak'ah before al-fajr neither in residence nor in travel (as related in al-sunnah al-sahihah).\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There were two calls for salaat ul-fajr (prayer) at the time of Allaah's Messenger (peace be upon him), the first just before dawnfor those who are awake performing night prayers( Qe iaam Al-lyl) so as for them to either rest for Fajr or have food if they intend to fast the next day, and for those who are asleep in order they may begin to arouse and be ready for Fajr( since it is preferred as early as possible)and the second at the actual time of fajr to indicate the appropriate time and to call people to the prayer, among other benefits of the adhaan. Regarding the second point, jumhoor al-'ulemaa' (majority of the scholars) agree that the statement (within adhaan for fajr) \"prayer is superior to sleeping\" should be said in the second call to prayer. Hence, the caller or mu'athin should adhere to the saying phrase and recite it even if people are inside the mosque. It contains benefits which might be slip one's mind. Moreover, it reminds people of the very fact: \"prayer is superior to sleep\" which concerns the immediate day as well as all forthcoming days. Muslims benefit from it even when they are already in the mosque and gain the reward of repeating it after mu'athin, as per the saying of the Prophet : \"If you hear al-Mu'athin, say [i.e, repeat] as he says\" which is hadith sahih. Perhaps women and children who live near the masjid may benefit as well, and even the Muslims among the jinn. Additionally, there may be some people who feel sleepy inside the mosque or those who have nodded off while sitting. Thus, Muslims should preserve and practice this sunnah and not abandon it. May Allaah make us all successful in following the sunnah and vigilant in adhering and preserving it.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah has blessed His slaves by creating for them all kinds of provision on earth, and He has permitted them to eat from that which is halaal (permissible) and good; this includes very many things, it is not limited. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy.” [al-Baqarah 2:168] Allaah forbids a limited number of foods, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): “I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely, is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allaah’s Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering).” [al-An’aam 6:145] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the eating of every carnivorous animal that has fangs, and every bird which has talons. (Narrated by Muslim, 6/60) And he forbade the flesh of (domestic) donkeys (narrated by al-Mukhari in al-Fath, no. 4215). Of the foods which are to be found nowadays, some of them are clearly haraam, such as dead meat [from an animal which has died naturally as opposed to being slaughtered properly] and pork. Some foods may contain ingredients and derivatives which come from haraam sources, so we have to find out where they come from so that we may know what the ruling is concerning them. The gelatin which was mentioned in the question may originate from the skin, muscles and bones of haraam animals such as pigs. Hence gelatin which is derived from collagen which comes from pigs is haraam, because it is as if the pig had been turned into salt. The most correct view is that it is haraam even if it has been changed, so long as it originally came from a pig, which is haraam. The fats which are used in foods come either from vegetable sources or animal sources. If they come from vegetable sources they are halaal, so long as they have not been mixed with anything that is impure (najjis) or anything that could contaminate them. If they come from animal sources, they are either from animals that we are permitted to eat or animals that we are not permitted to eat. If they come from an animal that we are permitted to eat, then they come under the same ruling as the meat of that animal. If they come from an animal which it is haraam for us to eat – such as pigs – then we look at whether they are used in foods or for other purposes. If they are usedfor non-food purposes, e.g. many fats are used in making soap, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion, but the most correct view is that they are haraam. If they are used in foods, e.g., pig fat (lard) is used in making sweets and other foods, this is haraam. With regard to cheese: if it is made from the milk of an animal which we are not permitted to eat, then according to scholarly consensus it is not permissible to eat it. If it is made from the milk of an animal which we are permitted to eat, and it is known that it is made with rennet that has been derived from an animal slaughtered according to sharee’ah andit has not been mixed with any najaasah (impurity), then it may be eaten. If it was made with rennet derived from dead meat, there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether we may eat it, but the most correct view is that it is haraam. If it was made with rennet from a source which is inherently naajis (impure), such as rennet derived from pigs, then it should not be eaten. See Ahkaam al-At’imah fi’l-Sharee’ah al-Islamiyyah by al-Tareeqi, p. 482 In many cases these matters are unclear to the Muslim (he does not know the source of food ingredients). In this case, it is better to fear Allaah and be cautious. Avoiding doubtful things may be preferable to using them in these circumstances, as stated in the hadeeth narrated by al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say – and al-Nu’maan pointed to hisears – “That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain, and between the two of them there are doubtful matters about which not many people know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allaah’s sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if it is sound, all the body issound and which, if it is corrupt, all of it will be corrupt. Truly it is the heart.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1599). From the above we learn that the basic principle concerning food is that it is halaal, apart from those things for which there is clear evidence (daleel) that they are haraam, such as dead meat, blood, animals sacrificed to other than Allaah and meat over which the name of Allaah was not pronounced at the time of slaughter. Concerning the foods mentioned in the question: if it is proven that they contain ingredients derived from haraam sources, it is necessary to avoid them, otherwise they need not be avoided. If you are not sure whether they contain anything haraam or not – without being paranoid or succumbing to the waswaas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan) – then it is preferable to avoid them as a precaution out of fear of Allaah. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The prostration of forgetfulness (sujood ul-sahw) is required whenever one inadvertently adds extraneous parts or misses parts or is in doubt regarding parts of the arkaan (essential pillars) of the prayer and/or its other requirements. The question posed regards what to do when in doubt regarding the number of raka’aat prayed, and the answer is covered in the following points: First, definition of doubtfulness: when two possibilities are equally probable without knowing or feeling one is more likely true than the other. Second, when one doubts after performing salaam: One should disregard such doubt. For example, take the case of one who has completed praying dhuhr then questions after finishing the prayer, \"Did I really pray four raka’aat or only three?\" Such doubt should be disregarded completely unless it is substantiated by clear and certain indications; otherwise, it opens the door to waswasah (the whispering of Satan) and unwarranted extraneous additions to the prayer. Third, when one doubts during the prayer; this must fall into one of the following two cases: One can discern that one of the two possibilities about which one is in doubt is more likely or more certain by virtue of one’s prevalent feeling or most likely inclination: In this case, one should act according to his best assumption and perform the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam. The evidence for this opinion is what was related by Ibn Mas’ood, may Allaah be pleased with him, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed either an extraneous addition or missed an essential part of the prayer (one of the narrators of the hadeeth was in doubt which). After saying ‘salaam,’ it was said to him, \"Oh Prophet of Allaah, has there been a new change in [the way of performing] the prayer?\" He replied, \"Why [would you say that]?\" They responded, \"You prayed in such and such manner.\" So he bent his legs and faced towards the qiblah and performed two prostrations then performed tasleem (saying ‘salaam’ to the right then the left). After facing towards us, he said, \"If something new had been introduced regarding the prayers, I would have informed you about it. To the contrary, I am but a human like you I forget as you forget, so if I forget, remind and inform me. If any of you doubts during his prayer then he should try to discern the more certain and correct case, then complete the prayer based upon it, then perform tasleem, followed by two prostrations.\" (Al-Bukhari, Fath Al-Baari #401). One cannot discern nor is there any prevalence apparent to indicate which of the two cases is more certain: In this case, one should assume the least of the two and continue based on this assumption, then perform the two prostrations of doubt before tasleem. An example of this would be one who while praying the dhuhr prayer is completely uncertain whether he has completed three or four raka’aat and cannot determine which is more true. Thus, he would assume the lesser of the two, i.e. three, and complete another raka’ah then sit for the tashahhud, then prostrate two prostrations before saying \"salaam.\" The basis for this ruling is the hadeeth related by Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudri, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said: the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"If any of you doubts during his prayer and he does not know how many [raka’aat] he has prayed, whether it is three or four, then he should discard and cast away his doubt. He is to continue upon what one is sure of [i.e. the lesser] then perform two prostrations before making tasleem. If he ends up [in reality] praying five [raka’aat], then his prayer will be an intercession for him; and if he ends up completely the [requisite] four [raka’aat] then it is targheeman for shaytaan.\" (targheeman: i.e., a way of vexing Satan and humiliating and debasing him, as well as rejecting him as a result of his failure to achieve his desire of disturbing the worshipper.) (Al-Nawawi in explaining the hadeeth from Sahih Muslim, 5/60).\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) gave one of the chapters in his Saheeh the title of “Baab qabool al-hadiyah min al-mushrikeen (Chapter on accepting gifts from the polytheists),” under which heading he listed a number of ahaadeeth indicating that this is permitted. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar commented: “On this topic, Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi narrated from ‘Ayyaad ibn Himar [??] who said: ‘I gave the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a gift of a she-camel. He asked me, “Have you become Muslim?” I said, “No.” He said, “I have been forbidden to accept the gifts of the mushrikeen.”’ Then al-Haafiz (may Allaah have mercy on him) quoted some of the comments made by the scholars to reconcile the texts which indicate that such gifts should be refused with those which indicate that they should be accepted. (The scholars said that) gifts should be refused when the intention behind them is to win the Muslim over (by softening his heart towards them), and they should be accepted when by doing so there is the hope of befriending that person and opening his heart to Islam. There is nothing wrong with accepting unsolicited gifts and donations from non-Muslims, and it is permissible to spend them on Islamic projects and in other ways. But asking for donations from non-Muslims carries several risks, such as being humiliated in front of them or being controlled by them. If there is no danger of such things happening, there is nothing wrong with asking. When he was still in Makkah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to ask for help for the sake of da’wah, without any humiliation involved, from some of the mushrikeen, such as his uncle Abu Taalib and others. There is no humiliation involved in putting out charity boxes or circulating flyers giving account numbers for donations, and so on. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. Muslims must realize that the age of living estranged (religiously) in non-Muslim societies effects the proliferation of the haraam and the diminishment of the halaal. It is very possible what you have suggested is true, since the business sector specifically is more involved in interest than those in the government sector. However, I do not think that this cannot be generalized as a matter of principle in this matter. In general, we can say that it is permissible for the muslim to work in any sector as long as the work there involves halaal activities, and that it is not permissible to work in any occupation or position in any sector which would involve the Muslim in a function that is muharram. (interpretation of the meaning): \"... And for those who fear Allaah, He (ever) prepares a way out, and He provides for him from (sources) he never could imagine. And if anyone puts his trust in Allaah, sufficient is (Allaah) for him. For Allaah will surely accomplish His purpose; indeed, for all things has Allaah appointed a due proportion\".

So long as a woman adheres to these conditions, she may wear whatever she likes in public places and elsewhere, and her hijaab will be considered Islamic. These conditions may be summarized as follows: The hijaab must cover her entire body It should be thick enough to conceal what is underneath it It should be loose-fitting, not tight It should not be so attractive as to call men’s attention to it It should not be perfumed It should not be a dress of fame and vanity (i.e., it shouldn't be extravagant or excessively opulent) It should not resemble the dress of men It should not resemble the dress of kaafir women It should not be adorned with any crosses or pictures of animate beings Further discussion of each of the above points will appear soon, in sha Allaah.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Expenditure is obligatory upon a father to his son/daughter according to the Islamic law and shari'ah, as regards his/her housing, clothing, food, drink and the like. However, the concept is not tied to being a \"minor\" in the sense of Western laws. The requirement according to Islamic shari'ah are: that the person spent upon is poor or does not own anything, or does not own or possess what is enough for his requirements and is unable to gain their own income. that the one spending has enough wealth to spend on himself and his wife. that the one spending and the one spent upon are of the same religion. When the son/daughter is in need for expenses, then he/she is allowed to take from his/her father's earning even though it is haraam (forbidden). In such a case his/her du'aa' to Allaah won't be affected, since being a minor, he/she has neither might nor power. But while doing so, he/she should abide by the following observations: Not to expand and widen the scope of taking or accepting from his/her father's illegitimate earnings. He/she should try if he/she is able to earn a halaal income to become independent and self-sufficient and no longer in need of the father's support. To try as hard as possible all ways to admonish and advise he/her parents in the hope that Allah Almighty may guide them towards repentance from haraam earnings.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.You have discovered pages at a particular site, for which you have asked a proper rejoinder, that indeed show hostility towards the religion of Islam, ridicule the personality of our Prophet (peace be upon him) and carry false accusations and distortions. However, the matter is as said by Allaah (azza wa jall) (interpretation of the meaning): \"They want to blow out, with their mouths, the light that Allah has sent, but Allah has decided to bring this light to a completion even though the disbelievers do not like it\" (Al-Tawbah 9:32) I do not see any point in announcing the URL of their page in any other Islamic page which Muslims visit frequently. We should not propagate its existence or invite people to it even by indirect means. What I see as important is that some capable persons should send the proper translation of meanings of the following verse of Qur'an and other such verses to them: \"Those who disbelieve spend their wealth in distracting people from the right path, will continue to spend until it becomes a source of regret for them and then they will be overcome. And the disbelievers will be resurrected towards Hellfire so that Allaah may distinguish the evil from the righteous\" It should be enough to send them this and similar verses of Quran in rejoinder and to raise their anger. Doing so will be an act of worship and nearness to Allaah as Allaah (azza wa jall) has informed about the true believers (interpretation of the meaning): \"They suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of Allaah, nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness. Surely, Allaah wastes not the reward of the righteous\"(At-Tawbah, 9:120) I ask Allaah to reward you for your religious spirit and protect and support you.\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.1. A wife is permitted to serve her husband and his guests if she is wearing complete hijaab and nothing of her body can be seen. She is also permitted to sit with them so long as there is no sitting alone with one non-mahram* man, wanton display or other cause of temptation involved. As far as eating with them is concerned, if this involves uncovering some part of her body, then she should not eat with them. 2. The husband's brother is not a mahram. The various types of mahram have been described in the Qur'aan, and this matter has already been explained under question # 316. On this basis, it is not permitted for her to travel with him. In view of the seriousness of the matter of non-mahram men, especially the husband's relatives, entering upon women, and the fact that so many people take this matter lightly, there follow a few words of important advice:Warning against non-mahram relatives entering upon women in the absence of their husbands Some homes are not free of the presence of relatives of the husband who are not mahrams of his wife. They may be living with him for a number of reasons, such as brothers who are students or bachelors. These men enter the house without there being any sense of something strange, because they are known to the neighbours as relatives of the head of the household. The neighbours know that this is a brother, or nephew or uncle. This casual approach leads to many immoral deeds that earn the wrath of Allaah because the limits that He has prescribed are not being adhered to. The basic principle in this matter should be the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \"Beware of entering upon women.\" A man of the Ansaar asked, \"O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think about the brother-in-law?\" He said, \"The brother-in-law is death.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, 9/330) Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: This hadeeth refers to all the relatives of the husband apart from his father and sons, who are mahrams for the wife and she is allowed to be alone with them; they are not described as \"death.\" It refers to the brother, nephew, uncle, cousin and other relatives of the husband whom she would be permitted to marry if she were not already married. Because people customarily treat this matter so lightly, and a man may sit alone with his brother's wife, the brother-in-law is likened to death, and he is the foremost among non-mahram men who should be prevented from doing so. The expression \"the brother-in-law is death\" may have a number of meanings, such as the following: That being alone with a brother-in-law may lead to religious doom if it results in sin. That it may lead to actual death if an immoral deed is committed that dictates the punishment of stoning. That it may spell disaster for the woman if her husband's jealousy leads to divorce. That you should fear being alone with a non-mahram woman as much as you fear death. That being alone with a non-mahram woman is as terrible as death. All of this stems from the fact that Islam wants to preserve families and households, and prevent anything that could lead to their destruction. What do you say now, after hearing the warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about those husbands who say to their wives: \"If my brother comes and I am not here, show him into the sitting-room\" or a woman who says to a male visitor: \"Go into the sitting room\" - when there is no-one else present in the house? To those who take the idea of trustworthiness as an excuse, and say things like, \"I trust my wife and I trust my brother or my cousin,\" we say: do not trust too much and do not doubt too much, but know that the hadeeth \"No man sits alone with a (non-mahram) woman, but the Shaytaan is the third among them\" (reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1171) includes both the most righteous of people as well as the most immoral of people, and that Islam makes no exceptions whatsoever in such reports.A real problem This is the problem: a man marries a woman and brings her to his family's home, where she lives happily with him, then his younger brother starts to enter upon her when her husband is absent, and they begin to talk in an affectionate or even passionate manner. This leads to two things: she begins to detest her husband, and grows attached to his brother, but she cannot divorce her husband, or do what she wants to with the other. This is the grievous torment. This story represents one aspect of corruption, besides which are other kinds which reach the level of immoral sexual conduct and illegitimate children. In answer to the second question, a woman is not permitted to travel with her husband's brother, who is not her mahram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"A woman should not travel unless she is with a mahram, and no man should enter upon a woman unless she has a mahram with her.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1729). Among the conditions of a mahram for travel purposes are: he should be someone whom she is permanently forbidden to marry, such as her grandfather, father, brother, paternal uncle, nephew, etc. And Allaah knows best. * Translator's note: \"mahram\" refers to a blood-relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden, such as a woman's father, brother, son, uncle, etc.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This is a reasonable enough question for one who has not entered Islam, but one who believes in and practices this religion already knows the blessings which are his because of this religion. There are many reasons for this, which include the following: (1) The Muslim worships One God, Who has no partner, and Who has the most beautiful names and the highest attributes. Thus the Muslim’s focus and aim is concentrated, focused on His Lord and Creator; he puts his trust in Him and asks Him for help, patience and support; he believes that Allaah is able to do all things, and has no need of a wife or son. Allaah created the heavens and earth; He is the One Who gives life and death; He is the Creator and Sustainer from Whom the slave seeks provision. He is the All-Hearing Who responds to the supplication of His slave, and from Whom the slave hopes for a response. He is the All-Merciful and All-Forgiving, to Whom the slave turns in repentance when he has committed a sin or fallen short in his worship of Allaah. He is the Omniscient and All-Seeing, Who knows all intentions and what is hidden in people’s hearts. The slave feels ashamed to commit a sin by doing wrong to himself or to others, because his Lord is watching over him and sees all that he does. He knows that Allaah is All-Wise, the Seer of the Unseen, so he trusts that what Allaah decrees for him is good; he knows that Allaah will never be unjust to him, and that everything that Allaah decrees for him is good, even if he does not understand the wisdom behind it. (2) The effects of Islaamic worship on the soul of the Muslim include the following: Prayer keeps the slave in contact with his Lord; if he enters it in a spirit of humility and concentration, he will feel tranquil and secure, because he is seeking a \"powerful support,\" which is Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. For this reason, the Prophet of Islaam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say: \"Let us find relaxation and joy in prayer.\" If something distressed him, he would hasten to pray. Everyone who finds himself faced with disaster and tries prayer finds strength, patience and consolation, because he is reciting the words of his Lord, which cannot be compared to the effect of the words of a created being. If the words of some psychologists can offer a little comfort, what do you think of the words of the One Who created the psychologist? Now let us look at zakaat (the poor due), which is one of the pillars of Islaam. Zakaat purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness, and accustoms people to being generous and helping the poor and needy. It will bring a great reward on the Day of Resurrection, just like other forms of worship. It is not burdensome, like man-made taxes; it is only 25 in every thousand, which the sincere Muslim pays willingly and does not try to evade or wait until someone chases him for it. Fasting involves refraining from food and sex for an appointed time. It is a form of worship, and a way in which one can feel the hunger of those who are deprived. It is also a reminder of the blessings of the Creator, and it brings rewards beyond measure. Hajj is the Pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allaah, which was built by Ibraaheem (Abraham, upon whom be peace). By performing Hajj one is obeying the command of Allaah and the call to come and meet Muslims from all over the world. (3) Islaam commands all kinds of good and forbids all kinds of evil. It encourages good manners and proper treatment of others. It enjoins good characteristics such as truthfulness, patience, deliberation, kindness, humility, modesty, keeping promises, dignity, mercy, justice, courage, patience, friendliness, contentment, chastity, good treatment, tolerance, trustworthiness, gratitude for favours, and self-control in times of anger. Islaam commands the Muslim to fulfil his duty towards his parents and to uphold family ties, to help the needy, to treat neighbours well, to protect and safeguard the wealth of the orphan, to be gentle with the young and show respect to the old, to be kind to servants and animals, to remove harmful things from the road, to speak kind words, to forgive at the time when one has the opportunity to take revenge, to be sincere towards one’s fellow-Muslims, to meet the needs of the Muslims, to give the debtor time to repay his debt, to prefer others over oneself, to console others, to greet people with a smiling face, to visit the sick, to support the one who is oppressed, to give gifts to friends, to honour his guest, to treat his wife kindly and spend on her and her children, to spread the greeting of peace (salaam) and to seek permission before entering another person’s house, lest one see something private that the other person does not want one to see. Some non-Muslims may do these things out of politeness or good manners, but they are not seeking reward from Allaah or salvation of the Day of Judgement. If we look at what Islam has prohibited, we will find that it is in the interests of both the individual and society as a whole. All these prohibitions serve to safeguard the relationship between the slave and his Lord, and the relationship of the individual with himself and with his fellow-man. The following examples demonstrate this: Islam forbids the association of anything in worship with Allaah and the worship of anything other than Allaah, because this spells doom and misery. Islaam also forbids visiting or believing soothsayers and fortune-tellers; magic or witchcraft that may cause a rift between two people or bring them together; belief in the influence of the stars on events and people’s lives; cursing time, because Allaah is directing its affairs; and superstition, because this is pessimism. Islam forbids cancelling out good deeds by showing off, boasting or reminding others of one’s favours; bowing or prostrating to anything other than Allaah; sitting with hypocrites or immoral people for the purposes of enjoying their company or keeping them company; and invoking the curse or wrath of Allaah on one another or damning one another to Hell. Islaam forbids urinating into stagnant water; defecating on the side of the road or in places where people seek shade or where they draw water; from facing the qiblah (direction of prayer) or turning one’s back towards it when passing water or stool giving the greeting of salaam (peace) to one who is answering the call of nature; and putting one’s hand into any vessel before washing it, when one has just woken up. Islaam forbids the offering of any nafl (supererogatory) prayers when the sun is rising, when it is at its zenith, and when it is setting, because it rises and sets between the horns of Shaytaan (Satan); praying when there is food prepared that a person desires; praying when one urgently needs to pass water, stool or wind, because that will distract a person from concentrating properly on his prayer. Islam forbids the Muslim to raise his voice in prayer, lest it disturb other believers; to continue offering supererogatory prayers at night when one feels drowsy - such a person should sleep then get up; to stay up all night in prayer, especially one night after another; and to stop praying when there is doubt as to the validity of one’s wudoo’ - unless one hears a sound or smells an odour. Islaam forbids buying, selling and making \"lost and found\" announcements in the mosque - because it is the place of worship and remembrance of Allaah, where worldly affairs have no place. Islam forbids haste in walking when the iqaamah (call immediately preceding congregational prayer) is given, and prescribes walking in a calm and dignified manner. It is also forbidden to boast about the cost of building a mosque; to decorate a mosque with red or yellow paint or adornments which will distract the worshippers; to fast day after day without a break . Islaam forbids building over graves, making them high, sitting on them, walking between them wearing shoes, putting lights over them or writing on them. It is forbidden to disinter the dead or to take graves as places of worship. Islam forbids wailing, tearing one’s clothes or leaving one’s hair unkempt when a person dies. Eulogizing the dead in the manner of the times of Ignorance (Jaahiliyyah) is also forbidden, although there is nothing wrong with informing others that a person has died. Islaam forbids the consumption of riba (interest); all kinds of selling which involve ignorance (of the product), misleading and cheating; selling blood, wine, pork, idols and everything that Allaah has forbidden - their price, whether bought or sold - is haraam (unlawful); najash, which is offering a price for something one has no intention of buying, as happens in many auctions; concealing a product’s faults at the time of selling; selling something which one does not own or before it comes into one’s possession; undercutting, outbidding or out bargaining another; selling produce before it is clear that it is in good condition and free of blemish; cheating in weights and measures; and hoarding. A partner who has shares in a plot of land or a date palm tree is forbidden to sell his share without consulting his partners. It is forbidden to consume the wealth of orphans unjustly; to bet or gamble; to take anything by force; to accept or offer bribes; to steal people’s wealth or to consume it unjustly; to take something for the purpose of destroying it; to undermine the value of people’s possessions; to keep lost property which one has found, or to keep quiet about it and not announce it, for it belongs to the one who recognizes it; to cheat in any way; to ask for a loan with no intention of repaying it; to take anything of the wealth of a fellow-Muslim, unless it is given freely, because what is taken because of another person’s shyness is haraam (impermissible); and to accept a gift because of intercession. Celibacy and castration are forbidden, as is marrying two sisters, or a woman and her aunt (paternal or maternal), whether he marries the aunt after marrying her niece or vice versa, for fear of breaking the ties of kinship. It is forbidden to make deals in marriage, such as saying \"Let me marry your daughter and I will give you my daughter or sister in marriage.\" Such reciprocal deals are a form of oppression and injustice, and haraam. Islaam forbids mut’ah (temporary marriage), which is a marriage contract for a period of time agreed by the two parties, at the end of which the marriage expires. Islaam forbids intercourse with a menstruating woman, until she has purified herself (by taking a bath after her period ends), and also forbids anal intercourse. A man is forbidden to propose marriage to a woman when another man has already proposed to her, unless the other man withdraws his proposal or gives him permission. It is forbidden to marry a previously-married woman without consulting her, or a virgin without seeking her permission. It is forbidden to wish (a newly married couple) \"Bi’l-rafaa’ wa’l-baneen (a joyful life and many sons),\" because this is the greeting of the people of Jaahiliyyah(ignorance), who hated daughters. The divorced woman is forbidden to conceal what Allaah has created in her womb (if she is pregnant). A husband and wife are forbidden to speak (to others) about the intimacies of married life. It is forbidden to turn a woman against her husband or to take divorce lightly. It is forbidden for a woman to ask for another’s divorce, such as asking a man to divorce a woman so that she can marry him. A wife is forbidden to spend her husband’s money without his permission, or to keep away from his bed without good reason, because the angels will curse her if she does that. A man is forbidden to marry his father’s wife, or to have intercourse with a woman who is pregnant from another man. It is forbidden for a man to practice ‘azl (coitus interruptus) with his free wife without her permission. It is forbidden for a man to return home from a journey late at night and startle his family, unless he has previously notified them when he will arrive home. A man is forbidden to take anything of his wife’s mahr (dowry) without her consent, or to keep annoying his wife so that she will give up her wealth. Islaam forbids women to make a wanton display of themselves (tabarruj). It also forbids extreme forms of female circumcision. Women are forbidden to admit anyone into their husband’s home without his permission; his general permission is acceptable so long as they stay within the limits of sharee’ah (Islaamic law). It is forbidden to separate a mother and child (in case of divorce); to let one’s womenfolk behave foolishly (in an immoral fashion) and not say anything; to let one’s gaze wander everywhere; and to follow an accidental glance with an intentional glance. Islaam forbids the eating of dead meat, regardless of whether it died by drowning, strangulation, shock or falling from a high place; eating blood, pork and anything slaughtered in a name other than that of Allaah or for idols; eating the flesh or drinking the milk of beasts that feed on filth and waste matter; eating the flesh of every carnivorous beast that has fangs and every bird that has talons; eating the meat of domesticated donkeys; killing animals by keeping them and throwing stones at them until they die, or detaining them without food until they die; slaughtering with teeth or nails; slaughtering one animal (for food) in front of another; or sharpening the knife in front of the animal to be slaughtered. In the area of clothing and adornment, men are forbidden the extravagance of wearing gold. Muslim men are forbidden to be naked or to expose their thighs; to leave their clothes long (below the ankles) and trail them on the ground for the purpose of showing off; and to wear clothes that will attract attention. It is forbidden to bear false witness; to make false accusations against a chaste believing woman; to accuse someone who is innocent; to utter lies; to slander and backbite; to call people by offensive nicknames; to spread gossip and malicious slander; to make fun of the Muslims; to boast about one’s status; to shed doubts on a person’s lineage; to utter slander, insults and obscenities; to speak in an indecent or rude manner; or to utter evil in public, except by one who has been wronged. Islaam forbids telling lies; one of the worst kinds of lie is to lie about dreams, like fabricating dreams and visions in order to prove one’s virtue, or make some material gains, or to frighten an enemy. Muslims are forbidden to praise themselves, or to talk in a secret way: two may not converse secretly to the exclusion of a third, because this is offensive. It is forbidden to curse a believer or someone who does not deserve to be cursed. Islaam forbids speaking ill of the dead; praying for death; wishing for death because of some suffering that one is passing through; praying against one’s self, one’s children, one’s servants or one’s wealth. Muslims are told not to eat the food that is directly in front of others or to eat from the centre of the dish or platter; rather they should eat from what is directly in front of them or thereabouts, because the barakah (blessing) comes in the middle of the food. It is forbidden to drink from a broken edge of a vessel, because this could cause harm; or to drink from the mouth of a vessel; or to breathe into it. It is forbidden to eat while lying on one’s stomach; to sit at a table where wine is being drunk; to leave a fire burning in one’s house when one sleeps; to sleep with Ghamr in one’s hand, like an offensive smell or the remainder of food (grease); to sleep on one’s stomach; or to talk about or try to interpret bad dreams, because these are tricks of the Shaytaan.

Islam forbids taking back one’s charity, even if one pays to get it back; employing someone to do a job without paying him his wages; being unfair in giving gifts to one’s children; bequeathing everything in one’s will and leaving one’s heirs poor - in such a case the will should not be executed; writing a will that concerns more than one third of one’s legacy; being a bad neighbour; or changing a will to the detriment of one or some of one’s heirs. A Muslim is forbidden to forsake or shun his brother for more than three days, except for a reason sanctioned by sharee’ah; to hold small stones between two fingers and throw them because this could cause injury to eyes or teeth; to include his heirs in a will, because Allaah has already given heirs their rights of inheritance; to disturb his neighbour; to point a weapon at his Muslim brother; to hand someone an unsheathed sword, lest it harm him; to come (walk) between two people except with their permission; to return a gift, unless there is some shar’i objection to it; to be extravagant; to give money to foolish people; to wish to be like someone to whom Allaah has given more of something; to cancel out his charity by giving offensive reminders of his giving; to wilfully conceal testimony; or to oppress orphans or scold one who asks for help or money. It is forbidden to treat with evil medicines, because Allaah would not create a cure for this ummah which includes something that He has forbidden. It is forbidden to kill women and children in warfare; to boast to one another; or to break promises. Islaam forbids betraying a trust; asking for charity that one does not need; alarming a Muslim brother or taking away his possessions, whether jokingly or seriously; changing one’s mind after giving a gift, except in the case of a gift from a father to his child; practising medicine without experience; or killing ants, bees and hoopoe birds. A man is forbidden to look at the ‘awrah (private parts) of another man, and a woman is forbidden to look at the ‘awrah of another woman. It is forbidden to sit between two people without their permission; or to greet only those whom one knows, because the greeting is to be given to those whom you know and those whom you do not know. A Muslim is forbidden to let an oath come between him and good deeds; he should do what is good and make expiation for the oath. It is forbidden to judge between two disputing parties when one is angry, or to judge in favour of one party without hearing what the other has to say. It is forbidden for a man to walk through the market-place carrying something - like a sharp weapon - that could harm the Muslims, unless it is properly covered. A Muslim is forbidden to make another person get up, so that he can take his place. There are more commands and prohibitions which came for the benefit and happiness of individuals and mankind as a whole. Have you ever seen any other religion that can compare to this religion? Read this response again, then ask yourself: is it not a great pity that I am not one of them? Allaah says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): \"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.\" [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85] Finally, I hope that everyone who reads this will be guided to the correct way and to follow the truth. May Allaah protect you and us from all evil.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. If a man executes a valid marriage contract with a woman then it is permissible for the two to do as they please between themselves, even with only the contract. There is no period prescribed by Islamic shari'ah between the contract and consummation of the marriage, so this issue is up to the two partners as to what they decide is most appropriate and in their best interests. It is incumbent upon both parties to consider, respect, and ensure the other one's personal comfort and ease. Thus, if the husband sees that the wife needs some time to become acclimated and develop their relationship and level of intimacy before consummation, such as 3 months, for example, he should do so, and vice versa. Likewise, it is incumbent upon the wife if she sees that her husband feels an urgent need to guard his chastity by consummating the marriage that she should not prolong the period so that he does not fall into a state of awkward discomfort and difficulty, and vice versa.\n",

(a) Jumhoor al-ulemaa' (vast majority of the scholars) agree that the aqeeqa is a sunnah mustahabbah for those who are capable of doing it and can afford it. Among its benefits are breaking the influence of the shaitaan on the new-born. It is also permissible for a Muslim to make an aqeeqah for himself if his parents did not perform it for him. Similarly, he can do it for his children even if it is after many years if he didn't do it when they were young. Refer to the book \"Tuhfat ul-Mawdood bi-Ahkaam il-Mawlood\" by Imam Ibn ul-Qayyim, Chapter 6: \"The Aqeeqah and its Rulings\", Part 19: \"The Ruling for One Whose Parents Did Not Perform an Aqeeqah--Should He Perform one on His Own Behalf?\" for more details. It is mentioned there that Ismaa'il ibn Sa'eed al-Shaalanji asked (Imam) Ahmed regarding a man whose father informed him that he did not perform an aqeeqah on his behalf--should he perform it on his own behalf? He said, \"That is the father's duty.\" ... and it was said, \"Should one perform an aqeeqah on his own behalf as an adult?\" ... and I saw that it is preferrable if an aqeeqah was not performed as a child then it should be performed as an adult, and (Imam Ahmed) said: \"If someone does that I would not discourage it or regard it as reprehensible.\" (b) It is not mandatory for a person to take a loan in order to spend on an aqeeqah. However, if he does it then it would be considered commendable as per Imam Ahmed's opinion. It was related by Abi il-Harith that he asked Abu Abdullah regarding one who doesn't have enough to perform an aqeeqah; Imam Ahmed said, \"If he borrowed for it I hope Allaah would reward and provide for him by virtue that he has observed a sunnah.\" Refer to \"Tuhfat il-Mawdood,\" same chapter, Part 11: \"Regarding Borrowing for an Aqeeqah and its Rulings and Benefits.\"\n",

      "Contents Related Signs of jinn or Satanic possession Signs of black magic How to protect yourself from black magic and Satanic possession Praise be to Allah.Signs of jinn or Satanic possession People who have had experience with such situations have related that the following are among the signs of a person who is possessed by jinn (or Satan): Strong repulsion when hearing the Quran or Athan (call for prayers). Episodes of losing consciousness and/or epileptic attacks, especially when Quran is recited for the possessed person. Frequent nightmares during sleep. Tendency to avoid people accompanied by out-of-the-norm behavior. The jinni who possess him might speak when the Quran is recited for the possessed person. Madness, as stated in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): \"Those who devour usury will not stand except as stands one whom Satan by his touch hath driven to [epileptic] madness\" (2:275) Signs of black magic As for a person struck by magic he might experience the following: Dislike of ones’ spouse, as indicated in the Quran by the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): \"And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife...\" (Al-Baqarah, 2:102) Different attitude in the house from that which is outside the house. For example, a person will feel that he is missing his family when is outside the house but when he goes home, love changes quickly to extreme hatred. Inability to have sexual intercourse with ones spouse. Frequent miscarriage for pregnant women. Sudden change in behavior without obvious reason. Complete loss of appetite for food. Thinking or imagining one has done something when in reality one has not. Sudden obedience and/or love for a particular person. It should be noted that if a person experiences some of the above symptoms this does not necessarily mean that he is either possessed by a jinni or struck by black magic. It might be due to physiological or psychological reasons. How to protect yourself from black magic and Satanic possession As for curing this condition the following steps are recommended: Putting ones trust in Allah with a sincere belief that He is the only cure for everything. Reading Quran and known supplications expressing seeking refuge, the most important and effective of which is sura 113 and 114, Al-Falaq and Al-Nas, which were used to cure the Prophet himself. Surah 112, Al-Ikhlas, is recommended along with them, as well as the opening chapter of the Quran, Al-Fatihah. To cure black magic, some have successfully used seven lote-tree leaves. The leaves should be crushed, then mixed with water (enough for taking a bath). The following verses from the Quran are then recited: verse Al-Kursi (2:255), surah Al-Kafirun (109), surah 112, 113, 114; the verses which mention magic, which are: in surah Al-Baqarah (2:102), Al-A’raf (7:117-119), Yunus (10:79-82), and Taha (20:65-69). The possessed person drinks some of the water, and the rest is used to give him a bath. Removing the elements of magic as was done by the Prophet when he was struck by black magic by a Jewish man called Lubaid ibn Al-’Asim. Eating seven Aliya Al-Barniy dates (among the dates of Al-Madinah) first thing in the morning; if not possible, any dates will suffice, by the will of Allah. Cupping --removing excess blood. Offering supplications. And we ask Allah to cure your brother and ease your hardship and his, as He is the One who cures and there is no one else who can cure. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Borrowing with interest is considered one of the greatest of the major sins (al-kabaa'ir). The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) has cursed those who consume interest, and those who pay it. Borrowing money with interest is considered as peddling in it as the borrower pays it to the borrower. Whoever does this is to repent and express remorse, and he is to try as much as he can to return only the principle he borrowed without the interest, advising the person who lent him the money against this practice. If he cannot, as in the case of borrowing from interest-based banks, which rarely forgive but rather get back their dues even if by force, he is to return the principle plus the interest offering repentance to Allaah at the same time. Whatever the borrower has bought or developed in terms of legitimate and Islamically-permitted business based on the borrowed money, can remain in his possession. He is allowed to continue his enterprise and profit from it, paying sadaqah at the time on a frequent basis to purify his business and himself of the misdeed he has committed. Those who work in businesses functioning on money borrowed using interest for which they are not responsible can continue to work in such enterprises as long as the nature of the business is halaal and legitimate such as a Laundromat, etc. Allaah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is most correct and best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. The situation in which you are, dear brother, is certainly a difficult one. It is not easy to live with a father that has aberrations and perversities stemming from being misguided from the true path of ahl us-sunnah wal-jamaaah (the followers of the Quraan, sunnah, and our pious predecessors). However, a Muslim is to anticipate and seek reward from Allaah for: being patient with and persevering in dealing with your father; and, being polite when counseling and showing him the truth of guidance, using appropriate and agreeable methods that do not give your father the impression that you are trying to show superiority or arrogance, or that you are belittling him. Instead, your father should feel that the advice is from a son that acknowledges and respects his position as his father, and that your concern is out of care and veneration., as the case was with Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when calling his father to the path of truth. Allaah the Most Glorious said in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): When he (Ibrahim) said to his father: \"O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything? O my father! Verily, there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you. So follow me; I will guide you to a straight path. O my father! Worship not Satan. Verily, Satan has been a rebel against the Most Beneficent (Allah). O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allaah) overtake you, so that you become a companion of Satan ( in Hell-Fire).\" He (the father) said: \" Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not stop (this), I will indeed stone you. So get away from me safely before I punish you.\" Ibrahim said :\" Peace be upon you. I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me, ever most gracious. (surat Maryam, 19:41-47) Note that Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) addressed his father in the most subordinate and most refined, courteous, and polite expression (abati in Arabic). Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) did not say to him, \"I am a scholar and you are ignorant\"; instead, he said \"There has come to me of knowledge (as a Prophet) that which has not come unto you.\" Ibrahim (peace be upon him) showed his concern and compassion towards his fathers well-being when he said, \"O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allaah) overtake you.\" When his father rejected the truth and threatened to stone him, Ibrahim (peace be upon him) replied in utmost politeness, \"Peace be upon you,\" and promised him that he will pray to his Lord on his behalf for forgiveness. This is how a righteous son should advise his misguided father. You also should know that rejecting or denying the sunnah of our Prophet (peace be upon him) is an extremely grave matter; hopefully this subject will be covered in detail as a separate issue. In brief, if your fathers bidaah (innovation in religion) takes him out of the fold of Islam, then your prayers behind him is not valid since he would be a kafir (infidel, unbeliever). Such would be the case if, for example, he insists and persists in completely rejecting the sunnah in its entirety, even after the proof and evidence demonstrating and substantiating the truth and validity of the matter is presented to him. On the other hand, if your fathers bidaah does not take him out of the fold of Islam, such as the case of refusing to perform certain acts mentioned in the Quraan and Sunnah, then it is permissible to pray behind him and your prayers are sound, and Allaah knows best. Addendum: Sheikh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn Uthaimeen has replied the following with regards to this question: Denying (the sunnah) could be of two types: a denial with regards to interpretation or a denial of rejection. If it is a denial of rejection, in the sense that one might say, \"Yes, I realize that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said this, but I reject it and dont accept it,\" then the person is a kaafir (unbeliever) and has committed apostasy. Thus, it would be impermissible to pray behind him. If, on the other hand, it is a denial of interpretation, then he is granted a respite, if the interpretation is possible and warranted by the language, and he knows the sources of Islamic law and its resources. In this case, it is not an act of kufr, but rather under the category of those who innovate incorrect practices in the religion (if his interpretation is such). It would be permissible to pray behind such a person, unless there is a beneficial objective behind not doing so, such as deterring him from such opinions, so that he may reconsider his mistaken interpretations. In this latter case, then it would be preferable not to pray behind him (if such a beneficial effect would be realized).\n",

Did leading Muslim scholars celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi? When did the celebration of Mawlid al-Nabi appear? How to express love for Prophet Muhammad Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet Muhammad’s birthday)? There is nothing in the Quran to say that we should celebrate the Mawlid al-Nabi or the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet himself did not do this or command anyone to do it, either during his lifetime or after his death. Indeed, he told his Companions not to exaggerate about him as the Christians had exaggerated about Jesus (upon whom be peace). He said: “Do not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the son of Maryam. I am only a slave, so say, ‘The slave of Allah and His Messenger.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari) What did Prophet Muhammad do on the day of his birth? What has been reported is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made the day of his birth a day of worship, which is different to celebration. He was asked about fasting on Mondays, and he said: “That is the day on which I was born and the day on which I was entrusted with the Mission or when I was first given Revelation.” (Reported by Muslim, al-Nasai and Abu Dawood) Did the Companions celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi? Moreover, we know that the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were the people who loved the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) most. Was it reported that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), who was the closest of people to him and the one who loved him the most, celebrated the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Was it reported that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who ruled for twelve years, or ‘Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him), did this? Was it reported that ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), his relative and foster son, did this? Was it reported that any of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did this? No, by Allah! Is it because they were not aware of its importance, or did they not truly love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? No one would say such a thing except one who has gone astray and is leading others astray. Did leading Muslim scholars celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi? Did any of the imams – Abu Haneefah, Malik, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Seereen (may Allah have mercy on them) – do this or command others to do it or say that it was good? By Allah, no! It was not even mentioned during the first and best three centuries. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a saheeh hadeeth: “The best of mankind are my generation (or my century), then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people who will not care if their testimony comes before their oath or vice versa (i.e., they will not take such a matter seriously).” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Muslim and al-Tirmidhi). When did the celebration of Mawlid al-Nabi appear? The celebration of the Prophet’s birthday appeared many centuries later, when many of the features of true religion had vanished and bid’ah had become widespread. Thus this celebration became a sign of one’s love for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? But can it be possible that the Sahabah, the imams and the people of the best three centuries were unaware of it, and it was only those who came later who were aware of its importance?! How to express love for Prophet Muhammad What the Quran tells us is that love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is demonstrated by following the guidance he brought. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Say: ‘Obey Allah and the Messenger.’ But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers.” [Aal ‘Imran 3:31-32] The first ayah explains that love is just a claim, but the proof of sincerity is following what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought. The second ayah reaffirms the importance and necessity of obeying Allah and His Messenger. Hence Allah ended the ayah with a very stern warning in which those who refuse to obey are described as kafirs, and Allah does not love the disbelievers. We ask Allah to keep us safe from that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us of the danger of not obeying him, and the danger of adding to what he brought. The celebration of Mawlid or his birthday is indeed an addition to what he brought – as all the scholars agree. He said: “The best of speech is the Book of Allah, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The most evil of things are those which are newly-invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray.” (Reported by Muslim and al-Nasai). We ask Allah to protect us from bid’ah and to bless us by helping us to follow. Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad. And Allah knows best.\n",

If the reason for prohibition was the ability of the deceased to see people who are alive naked, then it would also be prohibited for men to visit the graves. You need to encourage your mother and sister to make du'aa (supplication) for your father, as this offers the greatest benefit to the deceased, and it is much better than the mere visit.

      "Related Praise be to Allah.Hanging plaques and cloths containing verses of the Quran in homes , schools, social clubs and places of business, involves a number of reservations and prohibitions according to Islam, such as the following: In most cases, hanging such things on the wall is done for purposes of decoration and adornment, as the verses etc. are written in calligraphy and colorful brocade. This is an inappropriate use of the Quran, as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind. Some people hang up such things for blessing - which is a form of worship. The blessing as described in Islam comes from reading or reciting the Quran, not from hanging it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and three-dimensional images. This is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Khalifas (al-Khulafa al-Rashidun), may Allah be pleased with them, who never did such a thing. The best way is to follow them, not to introduce innovations in religion. History tells us that in places such as Andalusia, Turkey, etc., the adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of verses only happened at times when the Muslims were weak and humiliated. Hanging up such pictures or plaques could lead to shirk, because some people think that these things are amulets that will protect the house and its people from evil and disease. This is shirk and is haram, because the One Who really offers protection is Allah, may He be glorified, and one of the means of gaining His protection is sincere recitation of the Quran and du’as taught in the Quran and Sunnah. There is the risk that the Quran may be used, in such cases, as a means of promoting one's business or increasing one's earnings. The Quran should be protected from being used for such purposes. It is well-known that the production and sale of these pictures and plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money. Many of these plaques are painted with real gold, which makes using them and hanging them up even more haram. Many of these plaques involve a kind of carelessness, because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no benefit to anyone because they are barely legible. Sometimes words are fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating, and similarly forbidden pictures of animate beings. Verses and surahs of the Quran are exposed to misuse and abuse by this practice. For example, when moving house, they are piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings, and other objects may be placed on top of them. This also happens when they are taken down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned. Some Muslims whose observance of Islam is lacking put these plaques and pictures up so that they can feel that they are doing something religious, in order to reduce their feelings of guilt in spite of the fact that this practice does not help them in any way. All in all, we must close the doors of evil and follow the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of Islam, whose people the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) testified were the best of the Muslims in faith and practice. If someone were to say, We are not going to abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it, we only want to remind people (about their religion) in our gatherings, our response would be: if we look at real life, will we find that this is what actually happens? Do people really remember Allah? Do they even read these verses when they raise their heads? What really happens is the opposite: people go against the words hanging over their heads, they still tell lies, engage in gossip, make fun of others and do and say evil things. Even if we assume that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc., the fact is that they are very few, and this does not change the Islamic ruling on the matter. The Muslims must turn to the Book of Allah, read it and recite it, and act in accordance with it. We ask Allah to make the Quran a light of guidance for us, and a means of removing our grief and anxiety. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

As long as you are confident in your heart about your belief, no such insinuations will hurt you (inshaa' Allaah). If a doubt strikes a believer or something appears to him as a conflict between different textual sources of Shari'ah, he must believe that indeed for such doubts there are true answers and for such apparent conflicts there are solutions even if he doesnt know it or is unable to find the right answer himself. However, a person should not collect all the doubts in his heart and worry about the complexities and leave aside the learning of useful knowledge. This is because it is incumbent upon a Muslim to learn and know things which have been clearly described (Muhkamaat) in Shari'ah so that he may be able to repel the doubts. Regarding the question you have asked, it is a known fact that legislation differs from one Shari'ah to another, while the principles and beliefs remain the same in all of them. So, making of portraits was allowed in the Shari'ah of Sulayman (peace be upon him) but is prohibited in our Shari'ah. Similarly, making prostration of salutation was permitted in the Shari'ah of Yusuf (peace be upon him) but is illegal in ours. Also, war booty was prohibited for nations before us but it is completely legal for us. The Qiblah of people before us used to be towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, but for us it is towards Ka'bah. In a similar way, marriage between brothers and sisters was permitted in the Shari'ah of Adam (peace be upon him) as opposed to those that came afterwards. The following is a clarification on the issue by Haafidh Ibn Katheer, who said: Allaah allowed Adam (peace be upon him) to marry his daughters to his sons for necessity. Every couple used to have a boy and a girl. Hence, he married the girl of one couple to the boy of another. This is said by Suddi regarding what has been narrated by Abu Maalik and Abu Salih, from Ibn Abbas, by Murrah from Ibn Masood and by other companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that Adam did not have (in his grandchildren) a baby boy unless it was accompanied by a girl, so he married the male of a couple to the female of another, and the female of a couple to the male of another.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Mirdaawi said in al-Insaaf (2/154): The author– Ibn Qudaamah – said that two conditions apply for sujood to be made up later: It should be in the mosque A long time should not have passed. This is the right opinion, as he stated. Imaam Ahmad said: He should do the sujood if the time that has passed is short, even if he has left the mosque. He also said: He should do the sujood even if the time that has passed is long, or he has spoken or left the mosque. This is the opinion favoured by Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah]. Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 94. In Al-Rawd al-Murbi’ Sharh Zaad al-Mustaqna’ (2/461) it says: (If he forgets), i.e., he forgets to do the sujood al-sahw which should be done before the salaam, (and he says salaam), then he remembers, (he should do the sujood) and it is obligatory (if the time that has passed is short)… If he has said salaam – and if a long time has passed according to what is ordinarily regarded as a long time, or he broke his wudoo’, or he left the mosque – he does not need to do the sujood, and his prayer is still valid. In Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen (3/537), it says: The phrase ‘If he forgets and says salaam, he should still do the sujood if the time that has passed is short’ refers to the sujood that should be done before the salaam, when he has already said the salaam. He should do this sujood if the time that has passed is short, otherwise he no longer has to do it, and his prayer is still valid. Examples: A man may forget the first tashahhud, so he has to do sujood al-sahw before the salaam, but he forgets and says the salaam. If he remembers shortly afterwards, he should do the sujood, but if he remembers a long time afterwards, he no longer has to do it. This is why he said ‘He should do sujood if only a short time has passed. If he has left the mosque, he should not come back to do this sujood – he no longer has to do it, which is unlike when he has said salaam before completing the prayer. In the latter case, he should come back and complete it, because he has omitted an obligatory act. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: Indeed, he should do the sujood, even if a long time has passed, because this will make up for what was missing. So when he remembers it, he should make up for it. But the most likely opinion is that suggested by the author (may Allaah have mercy on him), which is that if a long time has passed, the person no longer has to do the sujood, because sujood al-sahw is obligatory (waajib) either to make the prayer valid or it is waajib in the prayer as part of the prayer, so it is connected to the prayer and is not a separate prayer. We say that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps and misses the prayer, as soon as he remembers, let him pray.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari (597) and Muslim (684) from the hadeeth of Anas). But we cannot use this evidence with regard to sujood al-sahw, because it is part of something else. If a person remembers soon afterwards, he should do it, otherwise he does not have to do it. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.wa alaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh It is permissible for women to pray in congregation among themselves. Their leader should stand in the middle of the row according to the narration regarding Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) which indicates that she used to lead women in prayer and would stand with them in the middle of the row. This has been narrated by ‘Abdur Razzaq in Al-Musannaf 3/141 and Daraqutni 1/404, and is authentic due to evidences for it. Similarly Umm Al-Hasan narrated that she saw Umm Salmah (may Allaah be pleased with her) leading women in prayer while she stood in the middle of their row. This has been narrated by Ibn Abee Shaybah 2/88 and is also authentic due to other supporting evidences. Ibn Qudamah has quoted the difference of opinion on whether congregation for women is recommended, and then says about their leader: “The one who leads them should stand in the middle of the row. We do not know of a difference of opinion on this among those who support that one women may lead others in congregation. Since it is recommended for the women to be covered, ….. standing in the middle of the row makes it a better covering for her from the sides.”(Al-Mughni, 2/202) The author of Al-Muhadhdhab (4/295) says: “It is sunnah that the leader of women in congregation stand in the middle of them as narrated about ‘Aa’ishah and Umm Salmah that they lead women and stood in the middle of their row.” For further details refer to Jaami‘ Ahkaam Al-Nisaa’ by Al-‘Adawi (1/351).

Some powders and cosmetics that are used as makeup form a insulating layer over the skin and prevent water from reaching it, while others do not prevent water from reaching the skin. If a cosmetic item insulates the skin (e.g., nailpolish as asked in the question) then it is not permissible to perform wudoo' or ghusl over it, for any act of worship that requires wudoo or ghusl (such as prayer, etc.). Allaah the most glorified and Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning): \"O you who believe! When you prepare for prayer, wash your faces and hands .\" Al-Maa'idah (5:6) Washing implies that water must actually reach the part of the body being washed. Based on this observation, anything that prevents water from reaching the skin must be removed, otherwise purification will not be achieved, resulting in the prayer being void. If the cosmetic item does not insulate the skin and does not prevent water from reaching it (e.g., dying by henna or similar things which do not insulate the skin), then wudoo' or ghusl may be performed with it. Hence, dyes are of two type: the first is that which is waterproof, such as nailpolish, which must be removed before performing wudoo' or ghusl. The second is that which does not form an impermeable barrier to water, such as henna dye, and hence does not hurt the wudoo or ghusl.

      "Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. If your friend is mentally sound, then all you have mentioned about him indicates his disrespect of prayers. If he means what he says, then he would perform his prayers. His claim that he likes prayers is not truthful; if it were, then he would perform them accordingly. In fact, the following verse from the Holy Qur'aan applies to such a recalcitrant and unobservant person (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then there has succeeded them a posterity who have neglected and lost the prayers, and followed their lusts; thus, they will face devastation (on the Day of Judgment, i.e., he will face Hell).\" Surat Maryam 19:59. By completely ceasing to perform prayers, a person is judged to be a kaafir, based on several ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace be upon him), one of which is: \"The obligation and pact between us and them (the munaafiqeen, the hypocrites) is the prayer, so whoever abandons it has indeed committed kufr (i.e., become a kaafir, a non-believer).\" (Tirmidhi, hadeeth #2621, and it is sahih) The meaning here is that the hypocrites are guaranteed their security and immunity from being fought by the Muslims as long as they perform their prayers; if they abandon their prayers, then they are among the kuffaar, and are subject to being fought and killed in the war against them. The Prophet further says, \"What is between a person and committing shirk (associating partners with Allaah) and kufr (disbelief) is abandoning the prayer.\" (Sahih Muslim, #82) The man in question, accordingly, is to be shunned--no one should eat the meat he slaughters; he is not to marry a Muslimah; he is not to inherit a Muslim relative; he is not allowed to enter Mecca; upon dying he is not entitled to Muslim burial rites such as the washing of the body or the shrouding or the funeral prayer; and his inheritance is to go to the the community fund and not to his inheritors. Thus, it is incumbent upon you to exert as much effort as possible in advising him and admonishing him concerning the gravity and danger of his crime, and of the punishment of Allaah the Almighty. If he persists and rejects your admonition, then you would not be wrong in abstaining from your friendship with him, until you can solicit help from other friends among those who accept guidance so that you may spend your time with them inviting him to Allaah.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.What your muallim (teacher) has told you, that in sujood the toes should be bent and should touch the ground, is correct. It is a proven part of the sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh from Abu Humayd al-Saaidi that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he prostrated the tips of his toes would be facing the qiblah (Fath, no. 828). Abu Dawood reported from Abu Humayd al-Saaidi: he would bend his toes when he prostrated. (Reported by Abu Dawood, no. 716, Bab fi iftitaah al-salaah). The author of Awn al-Mabood Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood said: He would bend (yaftukh) his toes the meaning of fatkh is to bend or flex, so he would bend his toes and point them towards the qiblah. (Awn al-Mabood, 2/419). The hadeeth was reported by al-Albaani in Sifat al-Salaah p. 142, 1411 AH edition [This book is also available in English under the title The Prophets Prayer Described Translator]. Pointing the toes towards the qiblah is sunnah and is encouraged, but if a person does not do it, his prayer or leadership of the prayer is still valid, especially as many people do not have the ability to flex their toes in the manner described. But everyone should put their toes on the ground when prostrating, because they are counted among the seven parts of the body on which we are commanded to prostrate. If a person lifts his feet off the ground when prostrating, and does not place the tips of his toes on the ground, then his prayer or leadership of the prayer is not valid. With regard to the way one should sit between sujoods, two ways of doing this have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Keeping the right foot upright and sitting on the left foot, as was described in the saheeh hadeeth which describes how he sat between two sujoods: He kept his right foot upright, and he pointed its toes towards the qiblah. This is the most well known way, and it is the way he sat most of the time. Keeping both feet upright and sitting on the heels, as was described in the saheeh hadeeth which describes how he sat between two sujoods: Sometimes he would rest on both his heels and the balls on his feet. (See Sifat al-Salaah by al-Albaani, p. 152). This is not the way of sitting that is forbidden. If a person who is praying puts one foot on top of the other and sits on them, he is doing something other than the sunnah, but his prayer or leadership of the prayer is still valid. In all cases, we should guide people towards the sunnah and teach them about it, because this is an important matter how could it be otherwise? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Pray as you have seen me praying. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 631). And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.I was very happy to hear that you and your sisters are studying Islamic issues and trying to find out about Islamic views of love. No doubt you and your sisters understand the importance of the scholars views and referring to them in matters of dispute. I will quote here a number of views about love, so that you will understand the matter better, in sha Allaah Love may be divided into mahabbah khaassah (specific love) and mahabbah mushtarakah (general love). Mahabbah khaassah (specific love): Specific love may be divided into types that are halaal and types that are haraam. Halaal love includes: (1) Love of Allaah, which is the most important obligation, as it is the basis of Islam. By perfecting ones love of Allaah, one perfects ones faith. If ones love of Allaah is lacking, then ones Tawheed is also lacking. The daleel (evidence) for this is the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning): . . . But those who believe, love Allaah more (than anything else) . . . [al-Baqarah 2:165] Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight . . . are dearer to you than Allaah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allaah guides not the people who are faasiqoon (rebellious, disobedient). [al-Tawbah 9:24] There are also other similar proofs in the Quraan and Sunnah. Love of Allaah may also take the form of preferring what Allaah loves and wants of His slave to what the slave himself might love and want. So he loves what Allaah loves, hates what He hates, takes as friends or regards as enemies for His sake, and adheres to His laws. There is much that may strengthen this love. (2) Love of Allaahs Messenger, which is also one of the most important duties of Islaam. Indeed, faith is not complete until a person loves the Messenger of Allaah more than he loves himself, as in the ahaadeeth: The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said: None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people. (Reported by Muslim, no. 44). Abdullaah ibn Hishaam said: We were with the Prophet (peace be upon him), and he was holding the hand of Umar ibn al-Khattaab. Umar said to him: O Messenger of Allaah, you are dearer to me than everything except my own self. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: No (that is not right), by the One in Whose hand is my soul, until I am dearer to you than your own self. Umar said to him, Now, by Allaah, you are dearer to me than my own self. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Now (you are right), O Umar. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 6632). This love is part of loving Allaah and is manifested by following the Prophet (peace be upon him) and preferring his opinion over that of others. (3) Love of the Prophets and the believers. This is obligatory because loving Allaah dictates that one should love the people who obey Him, in other words the Prophets and righteous people. The daleel (evidence) for this is the hadeeth Whoever loves for the sake of Allaah (i.e., loves the people of faith for the sake of Allaah). Obedience to Allaah is based on love of Allaah. Faith cannot be perfected except in this way, even if one has a lot of prayer and fasting to ones credit. As Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: You have seen us at the time of the Messenger of Allaah: none of us would think that he had more right to his own money than his Muslim brother. Forbidden love: This includes love which constitutes shirk, which is when a person loves something instead of Allaah or as much as Him. In such a case he has taken that thing as a rival to Allaah. This is the shirk of love, and most people have taken things as rivals to Allaah in love and glorification. There are also types of forbidden love which do not go to the extent of shirk, such as loving ones family, wealth, tribe, business or house, and preferring those things, in whole or in part, over doing the duties that Allaah requires of him, such as hijrah (migration for His sake), jihaad, etc. The daleel (evidence) for this is the aayah quoted above (Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline, and the dwellings in which you delight . . . are dearer to you than Allaah and His Messenger, and striving hard and fighting in His cause, then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision (torment). [al-Tawbah 9:24]) Mahabbah mushtarakah (general love): General love is of three types: (1) Natural love, such as the love of a hungry person for food, or a thirsty person for water. This does not involve any kind of glorification, so it is permissible. (2) Love based on mercy and pity, such as the love of a father for his small child. This also involves no kind of glorification, so there is nothing wrong with it. (3) Love based on acquaintance and friendship, such as that between those who share a common profession, or scholars in the same field, or people one meets on a daily basis (such as fellow-commuters), or people one does business with, or travelling-companions. This type of appropriate love between people, or brotherly love, does not imply shirk or associating anyone else in ones love for Allaah. For more information, see Kitaab Tayseer al-Azeez, Baab wa min al-naas man yattakhidhu min doon-Allaahi andaadan. We hope that this explanation makes the matter clearer. We ask Allaah to bless you and us with good. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim performs Taraaweeh in congregation in the mosque, and wants to offer more prayers at home, he should pray a series of two-rak'ah prayers and should not repeat witr, because the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"There cannot be two witr prayers in one night.\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and others, and deemed saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami', 7565). Umm Salamah reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to pray two rak'ahs after witr. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and others, al-Sunan 433). Al-Nawawi said: \"The correct opinion is that he performed the two rak'ahs after witr sitting down, to demonstrate that this is permissible, and he did not do this all the time.\" (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi Sharh Jaami' al-Tirmidhi). The sunnah is to make the last of one's night prayers an odd number of rak'ahs, as is reported (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 943). But if he has already prayed with the imaam, and wants to perform more prayers on his own and has time to do so - especially in the winter - he should do as is outlined above. As regards the number of rak'ahs to be performed in the night prayers, the Sunnah is to perform no more than eleven rak'ahs, because of the hadeeth narrated by 'Aa'ishah may Allaah be pleased with her, who said: \". . . He never used to pray more than eleven rak'ahs, in Ramadan or at any other time . . .\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 1874). The best way to perform the night prayer is to pray two by two (rak'ahs), and to separate the two even rak'ahs of witr from the one rak'ah (i.e., not to join the three rak'ahs of witr). The evidence for this is the hadeeth of Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: \"The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to perform the night prayers two by two (rak'ahs), then he would end with a single rak'ah.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 940). This is the best-known way of performing the night prayers according to the Sunnah of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him); other ways are also known.\n",

However, he did change the first names of those who had names with forbidden or undesirable meanings. Because your first name has pagan origins, your changing it to another name, such as Bilaal, is proper and correct.

      "Praise be to Allah.If a woman finds that she has to work because of necessity, she is permitted to work outside the home, as is indicated by the fact that the two daughters of Shu’ayb used to water the sheep, and the story of Asma’ bint Abi Bakr working outside the home. If a woman is widowed with children, and has no breadwinner and is receiving no money from the Bayt al-Maal (treasury), it is permissible for her to earn a living. Although we say that a woman is permitted to work outside the home when it is necessary, she should nevertheless do only the work she needs to do in order to meet her needs. If a woman has professional skills which not every woman possesses, and which are needed by other woman and society as a whole, then it is permissible for her to practice her profession outside the home, so long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee’ah and has the permission of her legal (shar’i) guardian. The evidence that it is permissible for the woman to work outside the home in a field where there is a need for her work, as long as she adheres to the conditions prescribed by sharee’ah, is to be seen in the fact that at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), midwives used to attend women in labour, and skilled women used to practice circumcision, and he did not condemn them for doing so. It is also known that Rufaydah al-Ansaariyyah used to treat the wounded in her tent, which had been set up in the mosque for that purpose. She was very skilled in treating the sick, and her work was done with the knowledge and express permission of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Sa’d ibn Mu’aadh was transferred to her tent for treatment. This indicates that it is permissible for a woman to practice her profession outside the home, and by analogy we may deduce that it is permissible for a female doctor to open a clinic outside her home for the treatment of women and children. By doing this, she is fulfilling the duty of fard kifaayah (a duty falling on the entire community – if some people fulfil it, responsibility is lifted from the rest, otherwise all will be held accountable. Translator). Such clinics make it easy for sick women to come to a female doctor, hence they no longer have to uncover their ‘awrah before a male doctor when they need treatment. But this permission is given on the condition that this work does not affect her duties towards her own home, husband and children, and that she has her husband’s permission, because these duties are her individual duties (fard ‘ayn), which take precedence over her responsibilities towards the community (fard kifaayah). When there is any conflict, her individual duties must come first. (Al-Mufassal by ‘Abd al-Kareem, 4/272). Another hadeeth which describes Muslim women at the beginning of Islam practising a profession was narrated by Hafsah, concerning a woman who used to treat the wounded. Al-Bukhaari, may Allaah have mercy on him, reported in his Saheeh that Hafsah said: “A woman came and stayed at the fort of Bani Khalaf, and told us about her sister. Her sister’s husband used to go out on military campaigns with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He had been on twelve campaigns, and she (his wife) had accompanied him on six. She said, ‘We used to treat the wounded and take care of the sick…’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 313). But a woman’s work as a nurse or doctor is regulated by the rules indicated in other Islamic texts. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar, may Allaah have mercy on him, commenting on the above hadeeth, mentioned some of these conditions: “What we learn from this hadeeth is that a woman is allowed to offer medical treatment to a non-mahram man (one to whom she is not related), so long as this takes the form of bringing medicine to him, for example, or other forms of indirect treatment (i.e. with no touching or direct contact involved) – except in cases where it is necessary and there is no fear of temptation (such as in an emergency situation or in the event of a disaster).” If a woman works in complete hijaab, without touching a male patient, or being alone with him in any way, and as long as there is no fear that she may be the cause of temptation or be tempted herself, and she is not neglecting a more essential duty such as taking care of her husband or children, and she has the permission of her guardian, then it is permissible for her to work. In principle, men should be treated by male doctors and nurses, and women by female doctors and nurses. There should be no mixing of the sexes in medical treatment, except when it is necessary and as long as there is no fear of temptation. And Allaah knows best.\n",

To the honorable brother: Sheikh Ali Darani , May Allah safeguard you , Judge of Nairobi - Kenya May Allaah’s peace and blessings be upon you. I have received your question by e-mail concerning the legality of spending interest money for the benefit of needy students studying in educational institutions in your country. Herein, I will summarize the answer to your question according to what scholars have mentioned: If a Muslim has earned or received unlawful money, he should get rid of it. He must neither derive any personal benefit from it, such as spending this money in eating, drinking, housing, family expenditure, educational tuition, nor can he use it in averting hardship and acts of injustice as paying compulsory insurance fees, government or sales taxes, and customs and duty charges. Indeed, the intention of its removal must be the purification of one’s money from interest, and it is not considered alms giving because Allaah is pure and good and He, the Almighty, accepts only that which is pure and good. This interest money can be spent in many beneficial areas, such as for the poor and needy, for medication costs for needy people, helping mujaahideen and advocators of Islam, sustaining the impoverished and relieving debtors who can not repay their debts. Moreover, this money could be used in Islamic Center needs, such as maintaining mosques (i.e. mosque washrooms and other such facicilities), roads, etc… Thus, spending this money in the tuition of needy students studying in educational institutions falls within the aforementioned possible avenues of expenditure. This is permissible even if these institutions are supervised and directed by unbelievers, on condition that the subjects areas studied are Islamically permissible and do not result in any harmful or unlawful consequences. Moreover, this interest is considered forbidden and unlawful to the one who earns it, but as for the people to whom this money given, it is permissible and lawful to make use of it, for it is considered as lost money that no one owns. Finally, may Allaah grant us success in supporting Islam and Muslims. Reference: Fataawa Islamiyyah, 2/401-411, \"What should one do who repents from earning forbidden money\", Al-Fawzaan.\n",

The disbelief of the disbelieving People of the Scripture, that include Jews and Christians, in our times does not expel them from being People of the Scripture. So, the rules and regulations related to them regarding permissibility of eating their food and marrying their chaste women, in the Quran and Sunnah, are still applicable to them.

      "Praise be to Allah.There are differences among the scholars concerning this matter. The correct opinion is that Tahiyat al-masjid is permitted at all times, even after Fajr and after ‘Asr, because of the general applicability of the hadeeth “When any one of you enters the Mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two rak’ahs” (Saheeh – agreed upon), and because this is one of the prayers that is done for a specific reason, like Salaat al-Tawaaf (prayer done after circumambulating the Ka’bah) and Salaat al-Kusoof (prayer at the time of an eclipse). The correct view concerning all of these is that it is permissible to do these at times when prayer is generally disallowed, like making up missed prayers. Concerning Salaat al-Tawaaf, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Banu ‘Abd Manaaf, do not prevent anyone from circumambulating this House and praying at any time of night or day.” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and the authors of Sunan with a saheeh isnaad); concerning Salaat al-Kusoof, he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The sun and moon are two of the Signs of Allaah; they are not eclipsed because of the death or life of anyone.” (1/332).\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. The division of the inheritance in the case you mention is as follows: An eighth of it is due to the wife, since the father had children, as indicated in the verse (intrepretation of the meaning): \"And if you have children, then to them (the wives) is due an eighth of what you have left behind, after [paying] any amount specified in the will or any loans due.\" (surat al-Nisaa':12). The remaining seven-eighths (7/8) is divided into 11 equal portions. Each male among his children is entitled to two portions and each female one portion, as per Allaah's specification (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allaah has enjoined upon you with regards to your children that the [entitlement of] the male is twice that of the female.\" (al-Nisaa':11). For example, let's suppose the man in question left property and wealth with a total worth of $88,000, and he does not owe payment on any loans and did not specify any special requests or instructions to make particular donations in his will. Thus, the division would be as follows: For the wife, an eighth, 1/8 of 88,000 which is $11,000. The remaining 77,000 is divided into 11 equal portions, 1/11 * 77,000 = $7,000 So each son is entitled to two portions, or 2 * 7,000 = $14,000 And each daughter is entitled to $7,000.\n",

My forelock is in Your hand (i.e., You have complete mastery over me), Your command over me is forever executed, and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety’ - but Allaah will remove his sorrow and replace his grief with joy.\" The people said: \"O Messenger of Allaah, we should learn these words.\" He said: \"The one hears them should learn them.\" Ibn ‘Abbaas reported that at times of distress, the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to say: \"There is no god but Allaah, the All-Great, the Patient; there is no god but Allaah, Lord of the Mighty Throne; there is no god but Allaah, the Lord of heaven, the Lord of earth, and the Lord of the Noble Throne.\" (reported by al-Bukhaari, may Allaah have mercy on him, no. 5870). The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"The prayer for one stricken by distress is: \"O Allaah, it is Your mercy that I hope for, so do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for a blink of an eye, and rectify for me all of my affairs. None has the right to be worshipped except You.\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad in al-Musnad, Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Adab, Baab maa yaqool idhaa asbaha; see also Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 3388).

The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said to his companions: \"Shall I not tell you some words which, if distress or grief befalls any of you and he offers this prayer (supplication), it will bring him joy? It is the du‘aa’ of Dhoo’l-Noon (i.e. Yunus or Jonah): ‘There is no god but You, Glory to You; verily I was one of the wrongdoers.’\" (Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no. 2605). Anas ibn Maalik said: \"Whenever something distressed him, the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to say: ‘O Ever-Living, O Self-Sustaining, by Your mercy I seek Your help.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 3446).

      "Related Praise be to Allah.If a man has divorced his wife for the first or second time, she spends her ‘iddah (waiting period) in his house and stays with him because she is still his wife and under his guardianship. If he wants to have intercourse with her, then according to some scholars if he does so at that time (i.e. the time of iddah), this means that he has taken her back and her ‘iddah is over. Other scholars say that he should say words that indicate that he has taken her back (e.g., \"I take you back\" or \"I take so-and-so back\") before he has intercourse with her, and that there should be two Muslim witnesses to these words. This puts an end to the ‘iddah , and he may then have intercourse with her whenever he wishes. The second opinion is the soundest course to take if he wishes to have intercourse with her. But in the case of the third divorce, she does not stay with him during her ‘iddah. She leaves his house and is no longer permissible for him (i.e. he cannot have intercourse with her) unless she has married another man; if he divorces her, then she is permitted to return to her first husband in a new marriage.

      "Praise be to Allah.One of the ways in which Islam protects women is that it requires a woman to travel with a mahram, to protect her from those who have bad intentions and to help her, because of her weakness, in facing the arduous trials of travelling. A woman is not permitted to travel without a mahram because of the hadeeth narrated by Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A woman should absolutely not travel unless she has a mahram with her. A man stood up and said, O Messenger of Allaah, I have enlisted in such-and-such a military campaign, and my wife has set out for Hajj. He said, Go and do Hajj with your wife. (al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 3006). What indicates that a mahram is obligatory is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded this man to give up the idea of jihaad (on this occasion), even though he had enlisted for a campaign and his wife was travelling for the purpose of worship, not for some frivolous or suspicious reason. In spite of all this, he told him to go and do Hajj with his wife. The ulamaa have listed five conditions for a person to be considered a mahram. He should be male, Muslim, adult, and of sound mind, and he should be a relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden, such as a father, brother, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, father in law, mothers husband or brother through radaaah (breastfeeding), etc. (as opposed to relatives to whom marriage is temporarily forbidden, such as a sisters husband, paternal aunts husband, maternal aunts husband). On this basis, the husbands brother and the son of a paternal or maternal uncle are not mahrams, so it is not permitted for her to travel with them. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There is a dispute amongst the religious scholars regarding the longest period of nifaas (the post-natal bleeding period). Some scholars say it is forty (40) days, others say it is sixty (60) days and some say there is no limit to the maximum number of days a woman can be a in a state of nifaas. The most predominate opinion is that the maximum period is forty (40) days according to what is narrated by Umm Salama. Umm Salama said \"The nufasaa' (a woman in a state of birth blood discharge) used to continue to be in childbed for forty days at the time of the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him.\" Al-Tirmidhi reported: \"It is unanimously agreed upon among religious scholars from the sahaabah (companions of the Prophet , peace and blessings be upon him) and al-taabi'oon (those who had met only a companion of the Prophet , but not the Prophet himself) that the nufasaa' does not pray for forty days unless she sees tuhr (blood stoppage) before the end of the forty days period. She should then perform ghusl (ablution of the whole body) and she resumes praying. The majority of the religious scholars say that a woman does pray even If she continues to notice blood after the forty days period expires and this is the opinion of the majority of fuqahaa' (religious scholars) among whom Sufian Al-Thawry, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad and Ishaaq.\" Sunan Al-Tirmidhi hadeeth # 139. The same hadeeth is also reported by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah and Al-Daraami and is classified as hasan by Al-Albaani in Irwaa' Al-Ghaleel # 201. Al-Albaani has supported this narration by another hadeeth reported by Abu Dawood narrated by Umm Salama who said, \"A Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) wife used to remain in (a state of) nifaas for forty nights and the Prophet would not ask her to make up the prayers she missed during the period of nifaas\". Ibn Majah also reported that Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him, narrated that \"The Prophet had specified a period of forty days for the nufasaa' unless she achieves tuhr before that.\" Irwaa' Al Ghaleel # 223-222/1. Therefore, if a woman experiencing post-childbirth bleeding spent forty days and she still sees blood, then we consider this blood as istihaadha (womb bleeding between periods) which does not stop a woman from performing prayer (salaat) nor fasting (siyaam), unless the end of the forty days coincides with the regular menstrual period (dawrah); in this case she would consider this blood as menstrual blood.

This game of cards is based on the idea of gambling, and it resembles playing with dice, which is clearly prohibited in Islaam, as related in the authentic hadeeth of the Prophet : \"Whoever plays with dice, would (resemble) one who has tainted his hand with the flesh and blood of a pig,\" narrated by Muslim (2260). The playing cards include pictures of creations with a soul (the Jack and Queen ). The rancor, enmity, bitterness, and/or ill-feeling which may occur between the players (shahnaa' wa-baghdaa'). The game promotes cheating, deception, and trickery (ghish wa-tahaayul). It distracts from the worship of Allaah, and from salaat.

      "Praise be to Allah., The reactions of non-muslim mothers towards their children's embracement of Islam varies. Some mothers are peaceful and passive considering this as a personal matter which does not affect the relationship between the mother and her son or daughter. In such cases more piety by the child towards his or her mother will make the mother admire and respect Islam. Other mothers adopts a more stubborn approach at the beginning but the mother finally gives in and accepts the new religion as a fact of life after she sees the child's determination and persistence which could lead the mother herself to embrace Islam. In the third case we find that some mothers are constantly stubborn to the extent that she might hurt and oppress her son or daughter. Usually such mothers are blindly prejudice because they consider that her son or daughter had gone astray by leaving the faith of his fathers and ancestors and she must do something to help go back to the right path (according to the mother). The following are three stories that took place at the time of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, that involved three of the Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him) which illustrates the reactions of their mothers after they embraced Islam: Story #1 On the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said \"My mother came to visit me one day. At that time she was still a polytheist and there was a pledge between the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, and Quraish (one of the great tribes in Arabia that lived in Mecca in the pre Islamic Period of Ignorance who used to enjoy great spiritual and financial powers). I requested the Prophet's, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, religious verdict and said: Oh Prophet of Allah, my mother came to visit me, seeking my help; should I keep a good relationship with her? Yes, keep a good relation with her said the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him:. Reported by Bukhari and Muslim, and this narration is listed in Sahih Muslim under # 1003. In another version narrated by Ahmad, on the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said \" My mother came to visit me when she was still a polytheist and she was living amongst Quraish. She was desirous, meaning in need, so I asked the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, and said: Oh Prophet of Allah my mother came to me and she is a polytheist and she needs help. Should I keep a good relationship with her? He said yes maintain a good relationship with her. Story #2 On the authority of Abu-Huraira, who said: I used to call my mother to Islam when she was still a polytheist. One day, while I was calling her she mentioned something about the Prophet , Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, that I detested. So I went to see the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, while crying and told him: I used to call my mother to Islam and she would refuse. I called her today and she mentioned something about you that I detested. Please invoke the blessings and guidance of Allah on her. Then the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, said: O Great Allah guide the mother of Abu-Huraira. So I left full of hope because of the Prophet's supplication for my mother. When I reached home I found that the door was partially closed. My mother heard my footsteps and said: Stay still Abu-Huraira, then I heard the water running; he added my mother performed body ablution, put on her cloths and hurriedly opened the door without her head-cover and said: \"None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, is the Messenger of Allah\". I went back to the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, crying of joy and told him: I am bringing you good news; Allah answered your prayers and guided the mother of Abu-Huraira. The Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, praised and glorified Allah and said: this is good. I said: Oh Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me and my mother beloved by Allah's believing slaves and make us love them. The Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, said: Oh Allah, make this little slave of Yours and his mother (meaning Abu-Huraira and his mother) become beloved by your believing slaves and make the believers love them. Ever since, there was not a believer who heard of me, even without seeing me, that did not love me. Reported by Muslim in Sahih Muslim (Muslim Authentic volumes) under # 2491. Story # 3 On the authority of Saa'd (Ibn Abi Waqas May Allah be pleased with him) who said that verses of the Qur'an revealed his story. He said Um Saa'd (his mother) swore not to talk to him ever nor eat or drink until he renounces Islam. She said: You claim that Allah commanded you to obey your parents. I am your mother and I order you to do this ( to renounce Islam). He said: She stayed with nothing to eat or drink for three days until she fainted because of strain. Then one of her other sons named Umarah gave her water to drink. And she started to imprecate against Saa'd, then Allah revealed this verse in the Qur'an, which translates to the meaning of And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do Verse 29:8 - Surah 29, Al Ankabut. This Hadith is narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad and in Sahih Muslim in his Sahih under # 1748. Also, Allah revealed another verse in the Qur'an, which translates to: \"But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that if which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do\"( 31:15 - Surah Luqman). Based on the above stories one can determine how to deal with a non believing mother and can draw the following significant conclusions: The importance of good presentation of Islam to the non believing mother and to try to kindly persuade her and to strive to convince her as Abu Huraira did (story # 1) Continue to do good to the non believing mother and to remember that her disbelief does not justify disobedience by the son or daughter and that doing her good does not contradict with your innocence of her as a non believer, on the contrary as it is stated in Verse 31:15 above, Allah has commanded us to treat the non believing parents kindly even if they strive to make their child a polytheist because of their rights as parents hoping that they will embrace Islam. Continue to sincerely pray and supplicate for the non believing mother hoping that Allah may guide her, as evident in Abu Huraira's story (story #2). The divine guidance of Allah may come after continuous strive by the child and strong objection of the mother as in Abu Huraira's story, therefore the son should never surrender or give up but should continue to pray and supplicate for the non believing mother. Regardless of how hard does the non believing mother strive to make the son renounces Islam, and the pressure she will exercise against her son such as refusing to eat or invoking upon him , the son should never surrender or give in nor should he retrocede away from the righteous path as one of the Sahaba said to his non believing mother in a similar situation: :If you had one hundred (100) souls and it all left your body one after the other I will never give up my religion (Islam)\". It seems that the mother in question deliberately oppresses her daughter through estrangement which makes her emotional torn but that should never weaken the muslim or shake his faith and belief in his religion. There is no objection to make the non believing mother understand that you are not going to retrocede , however she (the mother) can kindly ask for anything and she will be immediately answered to it except for giving up this religion. We ask Allah to quickly guide her to the righteous path and give you patience to call her to Islam and lead you to the righteous and correct way.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Punishments are what happen to people in return for their evil deeds. Trials are tests which are sent to try people, and people may be tested by good things or by bad. Concerning punishments, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself…” [al-Nisa 4:79] Concerning the phrase “is from yourself”, Qatadah said: “[It means] the punishment is for you, O son of Adam, because of your sin.” Abu Salih said that “whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself” means “because of your sin, and I [Allah] am the One Who decreed it for you.” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). Allah also says (interpretation of the meaning): “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.” [al-Shoora 42:30] Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said: “[It means] whatever misfortune happens to you, O people, is because of evil deeds that you have already done, and ‘He pardons much’ refers to evil deeds – He does not punish you for them but He pardons them. ‘And if Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, he would not leave a moving (living) creature on the surface of the earth…’ [Fatir 35:45 – interpretation of the meaning].” Concerning trials, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “If Allah loves a people, He tries them, and whoever has patience will have patience, and whoever is anxious will be anxious.” (Reported by al-Imam Ahmad; Saheeh al-Jami’, 1706). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: “The extent of the reward will be in accordance with the extent of the trial. If Allah loves a people, He tries them, and whoever is content will have contentment, and whoever is angry will have anger.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2320; Saheeh al-Jami’, 2210). The following outlines how one may tell whether a given event is a punishment or a trial: If the misfortune results from doing an act of obedience to Allah, such as being wounded in jihad, or losing money when migrating for the sake of Allah, or losing a job because of becoming a Muslim or increasing one’s commitment to Islam, then this is a trial. Whoever bears it with patience will be rewarded, but if one reacts angrily then one will earn the wrath of Allah. If the misfortune results from sin, such as sexually-transmitted diseases or illnesses caused by drinking alcohol and taking drugs, and so on, then this is the kind of punishment that comes in this world (as opposed to being deferred until the Hereafter). If the misfortune is connected neither to a good deed nor a sin – such as other kinds of diseases and sicknesses, losing a child, or failing in business – then it depends on the person’s situation. If he is good and devout, it is a trial, and if he is sinful, it is a punishment. The misfortune may be a punishment to atone for sins, or it may be a trial aimed at raising a person’s status and increasing his hasanat (good deeds/rewards) – this may be determined by whether a person is obedient or disobedient. A person should not praise himself, rather he should criticize himself for his shortcomings and strive to attain perfection. He will benefit from misfortunes in any case, if he has patience and hopes for reward. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.besides Whom there is nobody to praise when calamity strikes. My dear brother, you should realize that no calamity befalls a person except because of sin, and it cannot be lifted except by repentance. Despite all the hardship you are facing and the intense pain you are feeling, you still have to think about the root of the problem and understand the shar’i ruling on it and learn a lesson from what has happened. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself…” [al-Nisa’ 4:79] it comes from yourself because you gave yourself free rein in starting this forbidden relationship and getting to know this girl in a manner that is not approved of in sharee’ah, and because you indulged in absolute freedom in an environment that is far removed from the laws of Allaah. Don’t you see that our Lord is truly Wise and All-Knowing when He forbids men to deliberately look at non-mahram women or to touch them or be alone with them or take them as friends? Allaah knows that this leads to haraam things whether it is immoral actions of varying decrees or falling in love – which is the serious and fatal disease from which you are suffering because of your sin. You have become one of its victims, suffering its pain and choking on it. You have been very frank in describing this disease from its onset, and how you fell into this devilish trap, when you said in your question: “I have met a wonderful Muslim girl six months ago... We talked for many months and have become very close. Actually we are in love with each other.” But you mention that you feel that Allaah has led you to one another. If you mean that this has happened by the will and decree of Allaah, then this is correct. Even Iblees exists by the will and decree of Allaah. But if you meant that Allaah decreed this because He likes it and approves of it, (this is wrong, because) Allaah does not approve of anything that is haraam. Just because something happens does not mean that Allaah likes it or approves of it. Allaah decrees good and evil for reasons which only He knows. If you say now that what has happened has happened, and cannot be changed, so what can we do about this father who is standing in the way of these two lovers who want to get married? I would say that there is nothing wrong with making efforts – in halaal ways, of course – to persuade this father, such as bringing mediators from within the family, or the imaam of the Islamic Centre where the father goes, and so on, and praying earnestly to Allaah to make this girl part of your lot in life if this is good for you and for her. If what you want happens, then praise be to Allaah, Who is the Giver of bounty and blessings. But if all attempts fail, mediation does not work and the wind blows in the way that the sailor does not like (i.e., things do not go the way you hoped), then you should know that from the point of view of sharee’ah you can never marry this girl without the consent of her guardian – which is her father in the case – because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Any woman who gets married without the consent of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1102, and by Abu Dawood, Ahmad and Ibn Maajah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2709). The marriage contract will not be valid even if it was approved by jaahili courts and kaafir judges. It is impossible for running away with this girl to be a valid solution, either in this world or in the next. We must also ask some other questions raised by your situation, such as: what is your commitment to Islam – do you pray regularly, for example? Does she adhere to the hijaab prescribed by sharee’ah? What is the attitude of your own family to the idea of your marrying this girl? Finally, you must realize that you will have to forget about her if she marries someone else. In that case, you should not waste your life regretting losing her. You never know where good may come from. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you, and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know.” [al-Baqarah 2:216] What has happened is a mistake of which you are going to bear the bitter consequences, but you have to be sincere towards Allaah and strive to repent and turn back to Him. If this girl is not destined to be your lot in life, then we ask Allaah to compensate you with someone better than her. “Verily, he who fears Allaah with obedience to Him, and is patient, then surely, Allaah makes not the reward of the muhsinoon (good-doers) to be lost.” [Yoosuf 12:90 – interpretation of the meaning].\n",

Is masturbation haram in Islam? Masturbation (for both men and women) is haraam (forbidden) in Islam based on the following evidence: Prohibition of masturbation in the Quran Al-Imam Shafi'i stated that masturbation is forbidden based on the following verses from the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): {And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts). Except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.} (Al-Muminun 23:5-7) Here the verses are clear in forbidding all illegal sexual acts (including masturbation) except for the wives or what their right hand possesses. {And whoever seeks beyond that is the transgressor.} Some scholars used as evidence the ayah (in meaning), {And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His bounty.} (Al-Nur 24:33) This verse also clearly orders whoever does not have the financial means to marry to keep himself chaste and be patient in facing temptations (including masturbation) until Allah enriches them of His bounty. Prohibition of masturbation in the Sunnah 'Abdullaah ibn Mas’ud said, \"We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) while we were young and had no wealth whatsoever. Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said, 'O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.'\" (Al-Bukhari 5066) The hadeeth orders men who are not able to marry to fast despite the hardship encountered in doing so, and not to masturbate despite the ease with which it can be done. There is additional evidence that can be cited to support this ruling on masturbation, but due to the limited space we will not go through them here. Tips on how to give up masturbation As for curing/treating the habit of masturbation, we recommend the following suggestions: 1. The motive to seek a cure for this problem should be solely following Allah's orders and fearing His punishment. 2. A permanent and quick cure from this problem lies in marriage as soon as the person is able, as shown in the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) hadeeth. 3. Keeping oneself busy with what is good for this world and the Hereafter is essential in breaking this habit before it becomes second nature after which it is very difficult to rid oneself of it. 4. Lowering the gaze (from looking at forbidden things such as pictures, movies etc.) will help suppress the desire before it leads one to commit the haram (forbidden). Allah orders men and women to lower their gaze as shown in the following two verses and in the Prophet's hadith. {Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is all-aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.) ..... } (24: 30-31) Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Do not follow a casual (unintentional) look (at forbidden things) with another look.\" (Al-Tirmidhi, 2777) This is a general instruction by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to abstain from all that may sexually excite a person because it might lead him/her to commit the haram (forbidden). 5. Using one's available leisure time in worshipping Allah and increasing religious knowledge. 6. Being cautious not to develop any of the medical symptoms that may result from masturbation such as weak eyesight, weak nervous system, and/or back pain. More importantly, feelings of guilt and anxiety that can be complicated by missing obligatory prayers because of the need to shower (ghusl) after every incidence of masturbation, especially in the winter, and the invalidating of the fast. 7. Avoiding the illusion that some youth have that masturbation is permissible because it prevents them from committing illegal sexual acts such as fornication or even homosexuality, while they may not be at the gates of that immorality to begin with. 8. Strengthening one's willpower and not surrendering to the shaytan, and avoiding spending time alone as recommended by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) when he said \"Do not spend the night alone\" Ahmad, 6919. 9. Following the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) aforementioned hadeeth and fasting when possible, because fasting will temper one's sexual desire and keep it under control. However, one should not overreact and swear by Allah not to return to the act because if one does not honor one's promise, one would be facing the consequences of not living up to one's oath to Allah. Also, note that medication to diminish one's sexual desire is strictly prohibited because it might permanently affect one's sexual ability. 10. Trying to follow the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) recommendation concerning the etiquette of getting ready for bed, such as reading the well-known supplications, sleeping on the right side, and avoiding sleeping on the belly (the Prophet-peace and blessings be upon him- forbade sleeping on the belly). 11. Striving hard to be patient and chaste, because persistence will eventually, Allah willing, lead to attaining those qualities as second nature, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) explains in the following hadith: \"Whoever seeks chastity Allah will make him chaste, and whoever seeks help from none but Allah, He will help him, and whoever is patient He will make it easy for him, and no one has ever been given anything better than patience.\" Al-Bukhari:1469. 12. If one falls into this sin, they must hasten to repent, asking forgiveness from Allah, doing good deeds, and not losing hope and feeling despair; these are all prerequisites to curing this problem. Note that losing hope is one of the major sins punishable by Allah. 13. Finally, Allah is the Most Merciful and He always responds to whoever calls on Him. So, asking for Allah's forgiveness and help will be accepted, by His will. For more about the issues related to masturbation, please see these answers: 826, 27112 and 245978 And Allah knows best\n",

However, the level of education that a Muslim should provide for his children is not necessarily the highest level possible. This is because a child can lead a perfectly normal life with only, for example, high school education. And as for whether private schools are better than public schools from the shari'ah (Islamic jurisprudence) standpoint, I do not think that there is a general rule by which we can favor one schooling system over the other. It all depends on the specifics of each individual case when assessed with respect to curricula, teachers' skills, and the school district credibility. Wallaahu a'lam. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah. Performing prayers at the right time is a trust and an obligation, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Verily, al-Salaat (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.\" [al-Nisaa' 4:103]. Delaying the prayer past its appointed time is a grave major sin, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"So woe unto those performers of salaat (prayers) (hypocrites), who delay their salaat from their stated fixed times.\" [al-Maa'oon 107:4-5] Some scholars state that the person who deliberately misses one prayer and leaves it until the appointed time is over, with no excuse, is a kaafir. Claiming that one cannot find a place to pray is not a valid excuse, because either one is living on the face of the earth or not, and if one is living on the face of the earth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The (whole) earth has been made a mosque (or a place of prayer) and a means of purification for me, so wherever a man of my ummah may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 335) According to a report narrated by Muslim, he said: \"The (whole) earth has been made good for me, a means of purification and a mosque (or place of prayer); so wherever a man may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray wherever he is.\" (Saheeh Muslim, no. 521) The entire world is a suitable place to prostrate oneself; the scholars have made no exceptions except very few, such as graveyards and lavatories. Wherever a Muslim is when the time for prayer comes, he should pray: in a mosque, if possible, or else in a hallway or park, on a sidewalk or in a parking lot, or in a corner of a store. Even if one can find no other place than a church, it is permissible to pray in it. As far as praying on board means of transportation is concerned, then it is possible to pray there so long as the necessary conditions of prayer are fulfilled, or else one can wait until one gets out of the vehicle. If waiting means that the time for the prayer will pass, then you should pray in the best way that you can. Let us assume, for example, that you are in a car or train where there is no place to pray, you cannot stop and pray at the side of the road, and the time for that prayer is running out. In such a situation, the Muslim should pray in the best way that he can, even if he is sitting in his seat and even if he is not facing the qiblah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can\" [al-Taghaabun 64:16], and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"If I have commanded you to do something, do as much of it as you can.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 7288) An exception to be above is naafil (supererogatory) prayers offered when riding a camel, which is permissible even if one cannot get down or if one is not facing the qiblah. This is known from the report of Ibn 'Umar, who said: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray when travelling on his camel, no matter which direction it was facing, and he would gesture with his head to indicate the movements of the night prayer, apart from the obligatory prayers, and he would pray witr on his camel too.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 945) Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray voluntary (nafl) prayers when riding on his camel, no matter what direction it was facing, when he came from Makkah to Madeenah.\" Then Ibn 'Umar recited this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \"And to Allaah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn yourselves or your faces, there is the Face of Allaah (and He is High above, over His Throne)\" [al-Baqarah 2:115] Ibn 'Umar said: \"It was concerning this that this aayah was revealed.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2883; he said, this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth) We should not forget to point out here that Muslims living in non-Muslim countries sometimes delay or abandon their prayers for another, completely different, reason, which is that they feel too embarrassed to pray in front of the kuffaar in public or open places, or they are afraid that they will make fun of them and regard them as odd. This is a serious mistake. How can a Muslim feel embarrassed about proclaiming the truth and worshipping openly, hastening to fulfil the command of Allaah at the time when Allaah has said it is to be done? This matter has been dealt with in a similar question on this website (see question # 980). We ask Allaah to help us all to remember Him, to be grateful to Him and to worship Him properly.\n",

So spill blood for him and remove the harm from him.\" (Ahmad) He said that Ibn Sireen used to say if removing harm from him did not mean shaving the head, then I don't know what it is. Ibn Al-Qayyim (Allah's mercy upon him) said about the benefit of shaving the newborn's hair : “Shaving his head removes the harm from him, removes the weak hair so that stronger and firmer hair replaces it and it is beneficial for the head. In addition, it comforts the newborn and opens the head's skin openings... And along with this is a strengthening of his eyesight, his sense of smell and hearing. (Ahkam al-Tifl by Ahmad Al-’Isawi 192) Sheikh Ibn Uthaimin said: “It appears that shaving the head on that day has a positive effect on the hair roots.” (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti` 7/540) And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. The issue referred to in the question is one of the most serious problems in raising children nowadays. Some of the Islamic solutions to this problem and ways of instilling strength and honour in our childrens character are listed below:Takniyyah (using the kunya or patronymic in addressing children) Calling a young boy \"Abu Foolaan\" (\"Father of so-and-so) or a young girl \"Umm Foolaan\" (\"Mother of so-and-so\") will make the child feel more responsible and grown up, so he will become more mature and will feel above normal childishness. The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to give kunyas to children. Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was the best of people in attitude and manners. I had a brother whom people used to call Abu Umayr. I think he was just past the age of weaning, and whenever he came along the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) would say to him, O Abu Umayr, what did the nughayr do (Ya Abaa Umayr ma faala al-nuhgayr)?\" (The nughayr was a small bird with which he used to play). (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5735). Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was given some clothes, among which was a small black garment made of silk, known as a khameesah. He said, \"Who do you think I should give this to?\" The people were silent, then he said, \"Bring me Umm Khaalid\" and she was carried to him (which indicates that she was very young). He picked up the garment and put it on her, saying, \"Enjoy it until it wears out.\" There was a green or yellow spot on it, and he said, \"O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah\" sanaah means \"beautiful\" in Ethiopian. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5375). According to another report also narrated by al-Bukhaari: \"He looked at the khameesah and pointed to it, saying, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa.\" Sanaa in Ethiopian means beautiful. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5397).Taking them to gatherings and letting them sit with grown-ups This will increase their understanding and wisdom, and make them try to imitate adults, as well as keeping them from spending too much time on games and entertainment. The Sahaabah used to bring their children with them when they went and sat with the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him). One of the stories that describe this was narrated by Muaawiyah ibn Qurrah from his father, who said: \"The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to sit with a group of his Companions. One man had his little son with him; he would bring him from behind and make him sit in front of him\" (Reported by al-Nisaai and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaaiz).Talking to them about the heroic deeds of earlier and subsequent generations, Islamic battles and Muslim victories This will encourage them to be brave, which is one of the most important parts of being strong and honourable. Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam had two children, one of whom was present at some of the battles, and the other of whom used to play with the old battle scars on his fathers shoulder. This was reported by Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, who said that the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said to al-Zubayr on the day of Yarmook, \"Will you go and attack, and we will go with you?\" He said, \"If I attacked, you would be lying.\" They said, \"No, we will do (as we promised).\" So he launched an attack (against the Romans), penetrating their ranks and passing straight through, but no one was with him. Then he turned around and came back, and the Romans seized the reins of his horse and wounded him twice in the shoulder. Between these two new wounds was a scar from a wound he had received at Badr. Urwah said, \"When I was little, I used to play by putting my fingers in those scars.\" Urwah said, \" Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr was with him on that day. He was ten years old. He (al-Zubayr) put him on a horse and entrusted him to the care of another man.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3678). Commenting on this hadeeth, Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \"Al-Zubayr felt that his son Abdullaah was brave and chivalrous, so he put him on a horse, but he feared that he might attempt to do more than he was able, so he put another man with him so that he could feel that he was safe from the attacks of the Romans should he become distracted by the fighting.\" Ibn al-Mubaarak reported from Hishaam ibn Urwah from his father from Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr that he was with his father on the day of Yarmook, and when the mushrikoon (pagans)ran away, he attacked and started killing their wounded, i.e., he finished off every wounded soldier whom he found. This indicates that he was strong and brave from childhood.Teaching them good manners Among the manners that should be taught are those described in the hadeeth (prophetic narration) narrated by Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him): \"The young should greet the old, the passerby should greet one who is sitting, and the small group should greet the larger group.\" (Al-Bukhaari, 5736).Giving them the praise and respect they deserve in front of others This is made clear by the following hadeeth: Sahl ibn Sad (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was brought a cup and he drank from it. There was a boy, the youngest of all the people, on his right and some elders on his left. He said, \"O young boy, will you allow me to give this to these elders?\" The boy said, \"I will not give away my share of your blessings to anyone, O Messenger of Allaah,\" so he gave the cup to him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2180)Teaching them manly sports - such as archery, swimming and horse riding.Avoiding humilating them, especially in front of others Never belittling their ideas, and encouraging them to take partConsulting them and asking for their opinionsGiving them responsibilities in accordance with their age and abilitiesTeaching them to be brave as appropriate including how to speak in publicMaking sure their clothes are modest and protecting them from inappropriate clothing, hairstyles, movements and ways of walkingMaking sure that boys do not wear silk, as this is only for womenAvoiding extravagance, luxury, laziness and idleness Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"Get used to a rough life, for luxury does not last forever.\"Avoiding entertainment or pastime gatherings, singing, music and other wastes of time, because these go against strength, honour and seriousness These are some of the ways and means which will increase strength and honour, and protect our children.

Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah, may He be exalted, says: 'Who does more wrong than the one who tries to create something like My creation? Let him create a grain of wheat or a kernel of corn.'\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see Fath al-Baari, 10/385). 'Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any built-up tomb without levelling it, and do not leave any picture in any house without erasing it.\" (Reported by Muslim and al-Nisaa'i; this is the version narrated by al-Nisaa'i). Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Every image-maker will be in the Fire, and for every image that he made a soul will be created for him, which will be punished in the Fire.\" Ibn 'Abbaas said: \"If you must do that, make pictures of trees and other inanimate objects.\" (Reported by Muslim, 3/1871) These ahaadeeth indicate that pictures of animate beings are haraam, whether they are humans or other creatures, whether they are three-dimensional or two-dimensional, whether they are printed, drawn, etched, engraved, carved, cast in moulds, etc. These ahaadeeth include all of these types of pictures. The Muslim should submit to the teachings of Islam and not argue with them by saying, \"But I am not worshipping them or prostrating to them!\" If we think about just one aspect of the evil caused by the prevalence of photographs and pictures in our times, we will understand something of the wisdom behind this prohibition: that aspect is the great corruption caused by the provoking of physical desires and subsequent spread of immorality caused by these pictures. The Muslim should not keep any pictures of animate beings in his house, because they will prevent the angels from entering. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see al-Fath, 10/380). But nowadays, unfortunately, one can even find in some Muslim homes statues of gods worshipped by the kuffaar (such as Buddha etc.) which they keep on the basis that they are antiques or decorative pieces. These things are more strictly prohibited than others, just as pictures which are hung up are worse than pictures which are not hung up, for how easily they can lead to glorification, and cause grief or be a source of boasting! We cannot say that these pictures are kept for memory's sake, because true memories of a Muslim relative or friend reside in the heart, and we remember them by praying for mercy and forgiveness for them. Taking pictures with a camera involves human actions such as focusing, pressing the shutter, developing, printing, and so on. We cannot call it anything other than \"picture-making\" or tasweer, which is the expression used by all Arabic-speakers to describe this action. In the book Al-I'laam bi naqd kitaab al-halaal wa'l-haraam, the author says: \"Photography is even more of an imitation of the creation of Allaah than pictures which are engraved or drawn, so it is even more deserving of being prohibited There is nothing that could exclude photography from the general meaning of the reports.\" (p. 42, see also Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/355). Among the scholars who have discussed the issue of photography is Shaykh Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani, who said: \"Some of them differentiate between hand-drawn pictures and photographic images by claiming that the latter are not products of human effort, and that no more is involved than the mere capturing of the image. This is what they claim. The tremendous energy invested the one who invented this machine that can do in few seconds what otherwise could not be done in hours does not count as human effort, according to these people! Pointing the camera, focusing it, and taking the picture, preceded by installation of the film and followed by developing and whatever else that I may not know about none of this is the result of human effort, according to them! Some of them explain how this photography is done, and summarize that no less than eleven different actions are involved in the making of a picture. In spite of all this, they say that this picture is not the result of human action! Can it be permissible to hang up a picture of a man, for example, if it is produced by photography, but not if it is drawn by hand? Those who say that photography is permitted have \"frozen\" the meaning of the word \"tasweer,\" restriciting it only to the meaning known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and not adding the meaning of photography, which is \"tasweer\" or \"picture-making\" in every sense - linguistic, legal, and in its harmful effects, and as is clear from the definition mentioned above. Years ago, I said to one of them, By the same token, you could allow idols which have not been carved but have been made by pressing a button on some machine that turns out idols by the dozen. What do you say to that?\" (Aadaab al-Zafaaf by al-Albaani, p. 38) It is also worth quoting the opinion of some contemporary scholars who allow the taking of photographs but say that the pictures should not be kept: \"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures.\" (See al-Sharh al-Mumti', 2/198). There are many bad things involved in the making of pictures. Besides the element of imitating the creation of Allaah - which is an accusation denied by many of those who make pictures - reality bears witness to the great extent of immorality and provocation of desires caused by the prevalence of pictures and picture-making nowadays. We must remove or blot out every picture, except when it is too difficult to do so, like the pictures which are overwhelmingly prevalent in food packaging, or pictures used in encyclopaedias and reference books. We should remove what we can, and be careful about any provocative pictures that may be found. \"So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can\" [al-Taghaabun 64:16 - interpretation of the meaning] Photographs which are essential are permitted - such as those required for identity documents, or for identifying or pursuing criminals [e.g. \"wanted\" posters and the like - translator's note], or for educational purposes which cannot be achieved otherwise. The principle in sharee'ah is that we should not exaggerate about what is necessary. We ask Allaah to accept our repentance and have mercy on us, and to forgive our excesses, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

It was also reported by al-Bayhaqi from Jaabir ibn Umar, narrating from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he said: a report concerning this was narrated from Ibn Abbaas from Umar ibn Abd al-Azeez. Then the shaykh said in his commentary: it is not permitted to speak when the imaam is delivering the khutbah, it is only permitted before and after the khutbah, even after the khateeb has arrived and after the adhaan, so long as the khateeb has not started his khutbah. (Ibn Uthaymeen, Al-Sharh al-Muttabi li Zaad al-Mustanfi, 5/78). [?? Makath ??] is well known, from which we know that it is obligatory to return the greeting of salaam, so in this case we understand that it is not forbidden to speak. And Allaah knows best. Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: When the imaam faces the people, he greets them with salaam and they respond, then he sits down. Then he mentioned the hadeeth quoted above, and others. Then he said (may Allaah have mercy on him): When he greets them with salaam, the people should respond, because it is more of an obligation to return the greeting than to initiate it. Then he should sit down and rest until the muadhdhinoon (muezzins) finish. (al-Mughni 2/297). And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. He or she is not required to change his or her name unless it embodies the worship of someone or something other then God, Allaah. However, its amelioration by choosing a new Islamic name is legitimate and encouraged. The fact that he or she would change his or her name from a pagan or non-Islamic name to an Islamic one would be considered commendable--however, it is not mandatory. Thus, if one's name is Abdul-Messiah, for example, or similar such names, then he is obligated to change it, as the Prophet (peace upon him) had people with the names Abdul-Ka'bah and Abdul-Uzzah change their names upon accepting Islaam. If the original name does not comprise or imply anything forbidden in Islaam, then he or she is permitted to retain it (such as the name George, for example). As noted, though, it is preferable to change it to an Islaamic name, as this also distinguishes him or her from the kuffaar. Note that if changing one's name in official documents and records poses a great inconvenience, it would suffice to change it among the people. In this case, he or she is called by his or her new name by friends, acquaintances, and the general public, while offical documents would retain the original given name.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The believer sees his sin as a mountain beneath which he is sitting and which he fears may fall down upon him. The rebellious person sees his sin as a fly which passes in front of his nose and he swats it away\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6308) This woman's overwhelming sense of the burden of her sin is a sign of faith. We offer her the following advice: She should examine her divorce from her first husband to make sure that it is sound according to sharee'ah (Islamic law), whether it took the form of talaaq (male-instigated divorce) or khul' (female-instigated divorce). She should make sure that her marriage contract to the second man is also sound, because a marriage between two people guilty of adultery is not valid unless they have repented (see questions # 33); if the contract is found not to be valid, it must be repeated. If this woman is sincere in her repentance towards Allaah, regrets what she did and is determined never to do it again, Allaah will forgive all her sins, no matter how great they were, so she should not despair of the mercy of Allaah, for no one despairs of Allaah's Mercy, except the people who disbelieve, and who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except those who are astray? She should hasten to do many good deeds, to expiate for her sin, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And perform al-salaat (the prayer) at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds\" [Hud 11:114] She should resume a pure Islamic life, based on purity and chastity. Suicide is not a solution at all, as it is one of the most grievous of major sins, and will only increase the punishment of the one who does it. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever throws himself down from a high mountain and kills himself will be throwing himself down from a mountain in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever takes poison and kills himself will be taking poison in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. Whoever kills himself with a weapon (literally, iron) will be holding it in his hand and stabbing himself in the stomach in the Fire of Hell for all eternity. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5778) We ask Allaah to help this woman to repent sincerely, to forgive her sins and to include her in His Mercy, for He is the All-hearing Who answers prayers.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. According to Islaamic Shareeah, it is not permitted to keep a dog except within narrowly-defined limits, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained: \"Whoever keeps a dog, his good deeds will decrease every day by one qeeraat (a unit of measurement), unless it is a dog for farming or herding.\" According to another report: \". . . unless it is a dog for herding sheep, farming or hunting.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 2322) Dogs are extremely naajis (impure, unclean). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"If a dog drinks from the vessel of any one of you, let him wash it seven times\" (reported by Muslim, no. 279). According to another report: \". . . and clean it the eighth time with earth.\" (Saheeh Muslim, no. 280). It is forbidden in Islaam to sell a dog and to receive payment for it, as is reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari from Abu Masoud al-Ansaari: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade (accepting) the price of a dog. (al-Fath, no. 2237) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us not to resemble dogs by placing our forearms on the ground during sujood (prostration), as in reported in the hadeeth narrated by Anas ibn Maalik, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Do sujood properly; none of you should spread his forearms like a dog does.\" (al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 822). Whoever keeps a dog in his house is denied the blessing of the angels presence in his house, as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3225). Keeping dogs nowadays is the habit of the kuffaar, who adopt them as friends, kiss them, let them lick them and their clothes, sleep with them and even leave them money in their wills. Keeping a dog is an imitation of the kuffaar. Some Muslims may claim that they need to keep a dog at home for purposes of protection, to which we respond that nowadays there are burglar alarm systems and other measures one may take for security purposes, and there is no need to keep a dog, praise be to Allaah. It only remains for us to say that the fact that it is forbidden to keep a dog and interect closely with it does not mean that we should not be kind or feel compassion towards dogs if we see them in a pitiful state. These are two entirely separate matters. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that \"a man saw a dog biting the dust because of thirst, so he took his shoe and started to scoop water up with it until the dogs thirst was quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and granted him entry to Paradise for it.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 174). According to another report, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whilst a man was walking he became very thirsty, so he went down to a well and drank from it. When he came out, he saw a dog panting and biting the soil because of thirst. The man said, He is suffering the same as I suffered, so he filled his shoe (with water), came out and let the dog drink until his thirst was quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and forgave him because of it.\" The people asked, \"O Messenger of Allaah, will we be rewarded for how we treat animals?\" He said, \"In every living thing there is a reward.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 2363). We do not want to omit reminding you of the importance of reading the Quraan properly and referring to it. You say in your question that the story of the thirsty dog is in the Quraan, and that is not the case, as it is reported in the Sunnah. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.To the dear inquirer:I welcome you with a warm greeting. I was besieged with great joy as I discovered your question while browsing through the ten questions which arrived during the past hour today, and it was the dearest question for me. This fact is not surprising, as how could our hearts not open to a wise man who has discovered the truth and has acknowledged and confirmed it for himself--one who wishes to embrace Islaam and asks about the next steps? In reality, everything that poses a problem for you is actually an easy matter, and can be solved simply, God willing (in shaa' Allaah), so let's take them one by one: First: all that is required of you to embrace this religion right now as you are reading these lines is to pronounce al-shahaadatain, or the two confirmations and attestations of faith, to the best of your ability. Perfect pronunciation of the Arabic letters is not required, and the following is a transliteration of the phrases with English letters to help you: ash-hadu an laa ilaahah illallaah (I bear witness and attest that there is no god worthy of worship but the One God Allaah) ash-hadu anna muhammad-ar-rasool ullaah (I bear witness and attest that Muhammad is the messenger of Allaah) After pronouncing them, you should promptly hasten to take a shower to purify yourself and prepare to start performing your regular prayers which will be an obligation as soon as you have declared your belief. Second: If you have not yet learned the manner and characteristics of performing the prayer (i.e. at least the movements and positions), appended to this message is a description from which you can learn. What is requried from you for the time being is to say in the beginning of the prayer and between each movement between positions \"Allaahu ak-bar\" (a glorification of Allaah). While standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting, you should say \"subhaan allaah wal-hamdu lillaah wa-laa ilaaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar.\" (Glory be to Allaah, and praise and thanks be to Allaah, and there is no god but Allaah, and Allaah is the most Exalted and Great.) Then conclude the prayer by turning your head to the right then left, each time saying \"as-salaamu alaikum.\" This way of performing salaat is permissible for you until you can learn and memorize what should be said in each movement and position of the salaat. Third: You are not required to change your name, and in fact, a number of scholars among the forefathers and modern-day Muslims have indicated declared that your name is in fact the name of one of the prophets! I ask Allaah to aid you and ease your affairs, and to bestow upon you the blessing of Islaam and perseverence in adhering to it. We are ready and willing to assist in explaining or helping to solve any problem or difficulty you may face, and to provide support and aid in any way possible.\n",

Allaah guides to his truth whomever he wills. At this point of your life, as an expression of gratitude for Allaah's blessing, you should carry out your duties towards him and desist from the actions that gain his wrath. In fact, Allaah, at this point in your life, must take priority over everything else. You further ought to make up for what you missed in the previous part of your life, to double your efforts in performing worship and to haste in doing good deeds. Secondly, since this lady in question has converted to Islam, thanks to Allaah, none of her kaafir family members can act as a guardian (wali) of her interests; no kaafir can act in this capacity over a Muslim. If there is a Muslim with some authority in your area over the affairs of the Muslim community, then he can act in this capacity, based on the Prophet's (peace be upon him) hadeeth: \"No marriage contract can be concluded without the presence of a Wali. A Sultan (authority figure) can act as a Wali for those without one.\" (see Ibn Majah and Imam Ahmad, Hadith number 1880; also in Salih al-Jaami', hadeeth number 7556.) If there is no authoritative Muslim person, then one should refer to the community Muslim leader or any Muslim who is just ('aadil), respected, and of high character, such as the director of the Islamic center or its imam, to conclude the marriage contract of this sister, with her consent.\n",

A person does not know where he will die. If the intention of the person is to get ready for death, then preparation should be in good deeds. (See selections of Jurisprudence writings by Ibn Taymiyah, Funeral Rights, by al-Albani, p.160, 40th ed, Islamic Center).In otherwords, preperation for meeting Allaah, is not by digging graves. Instead, it is accomplished by overabundance of good deeds. If it is not possible in predominantly non-Muslim countries to have a cemetery or dedicated plot for the burial of Muslims unless the graves are reserved beforehand (e.g., to raise the funds), then there would be no objection in this case.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.All Praises are Due to Allah A brief summary of the requirements for the Ghusl follow. First, the Muslim should make their intentions for purification, then wash the private parts. Then make wudu like the wudu done for prayer, then pour water on his right side, then the left side. Then water should be poured on his head, covering the entire body with water. It is also reported in the sunnah that the washing the feet should be delayed until the end of the ghusl. As is reported on the authority of A'ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when performing ghusl from janaba used to wash his hands, then wash his private parts with his left hand. After that he performed wudu like that for prayer. Next he took some water and ran his fingers in the roots of his hair until he used three handfuls of water on his head. He would then go on pouring water on the rest of his body and wash his legs. (It was reported by Muslim #479.) In the narration of Al-Bukhari it states that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then turned aside and washed his legs. Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in his book al-Mughni: \"Circumcision is obligatory for men, and it is an honour for women, but it is not obligatory for them. This is the opinion of many scholars. (Imam) Ahmad said: For men it is more strictly required, but for women it is less strictly required.\" (al-Mughni 1/70). Circumcision of the female consists of the removal of a part of the clitoris, which is situated above the opening of the urethra. The Sunnah is not to remove all of it, but only a part. (al-Mawsu‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah 19/28). In this matter, it is wise to follow the interests of the female: if the clitoris is large, then part of it should be removed, otherwise it should be left alone. This size of the clitoris will vary from woman to woman, and there may be differences between those from hot climates and those from cold climates. A hadith on the topic of female circumcision has been attributed to the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him), according to which he said: \"Circumcision is a Sunnah for men, and an honour for women,\" but there is some debate as to the authenticity of this hadith. See Silsilah al-Ahadith al-Da‘ifah by al-Albani, no. 1935. How circumcision is to be performed is mentioned in the hadith narrated by Umm ‘Atiyah, may Allah be pleased with her, according to which a woman used to perform circumcisions in Madinah. The Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) told her: \"Do not abuse (i.e. do not go to extremes in circumcising); that is better for the woman and more liked by her husband.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Adab; he said this hadith is da‘if). The scholars’ opinions cited above should be sufficient explanation. And Allah knows best.\n",

According to another report, he said: \"The Muslim does not inherit from a kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from a Muslim.\" (al-Bukhaari, 6764). The Messenger of Allah (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: \"People who belong to two different religions do not inherit from one another.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Faraa’id, and deemed hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 7614) - because when the ties of religion are cut, the ties of inheritance are also cut, because the former is the basis of the latter. However, if a non-believer makes a will leaving one-third or less of his wealth to his child (son or daughter), one is entitled to take it, because this is a will as opposed to inheritance according to a non-Islamic system. This difference is well-known in Islamic fiqh. And Allah knows best.\n",

So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination)…” [al-Maa’idah 5:90] Gambling means everything that involves one side trying to take advantage of the other, so that one will be the winner and the other will be the loser. This is the shar’i ruling on gambling. So a man who pays 500 riyals every month, for example, may buy books for which his discount adds up to more than a thousand riyals, or he may not buy anything at all. If we suppose that he buys things for which the discount adds up to more than five hundred riyals, then he will be the winner, and the storekeeper will be the loser; if he does not buy anything, then the storekeeper will be the winner and the man will be the loser, because he paid 500 riyals and did not get anything in return. This transaction is a kind of gambling and is not permissible.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Your interest in studying Islam is something great, which we appreciate. Everyone should seek the truth wherever it may be, and follow it even if it differs from the way of their forefathers or the religion of the country or society in which they live, because salvation from the Fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement is more important than anything else. One of the most important things that the would-be student of Islam should do is to consult authentic Islamic references, in order to understand the reality of this religion. For example, one should consult translations of the meanings of the Qur’an and the ahaadeeth (sayings) of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace be upon him), ensuring that the translations are sound. But reading books written by non-Muslims, or by Muslims who do not really understand or practice their religion, is not a scholarly approach or a sound method of finding out the truth. Returning to your question, what do Muslims believe will happen to atheists? Or for that matter, what about monotheists who are not Muslim? Will their fate be Hell in the Hereafter? The answer is that Allaah has clearly created everything, sent His blessings on His creation, and sent Messengers and Revealed Books to tell them that whoever believes in and worships Him alone, not associating any partner with Him, will enter Paradise, and whoever denies Him, or worships something else besides Him, or takes other gods instead of Him, or says that He has a wife or son, or that the angels are His daughters, or follows a law other than that which He revealed to judge between people in truth, or turns away from His religion, will be doomed in the Hereafter to the eternal punishment of Hell. This is exact justice, and this will be the fate deserved by the one who did not give his Creator His due. Worshipping Allaah, obeying His commands and adhering to His prohibitions are basic matters, but they form the essence of the relationship between the Creator and His creation. Allah says: \"And I (Allaah) created not the jinns and men except they should worship Me (alone).\" [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56] Messengers were sent with one message: to tell their people \"Worship Allaah, for you have no god besides Him.\" Hence we may understand just how far short the person falls who believes that Allaah is one and does not associate anything with Him, but does not worship or obey Him, but rebels against Him and fails to follow His religion or Law, or the Revelation and Messengers which He sent for him and people like him. Does such a person deserve to enter Paradise or Hell? This is the person who says: \"I believe that there is One God Who created the universe, but I am going to stop there; I will not pray to Him or fast or perform Hajj or pay zakaat as He commanded. I am not going to carry out any duties towards Him; I will follow my own desires and do whatever I want, whether He permitted it or forbade it.\" Can such a person attain salvation on the Day of Judgement? Allaah sent Messengers to every nation, that they might worship Him and shun false deities. The last nation is this ummah, and the last Messenger is Muhammad (peace be upon him). Allaah sent him for the whole of mankind, the entire world, and thus abrogated the previous laws and made this religion the best and most perfect and complete. Hence it is obligatory for everyone to enter this religion, for Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.\" [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85] On this basis, the fate of one who says \"I believe in the idea of One God, but I do not want to be a Muslim, or I do not want to follow the last Revelation or the last Prophet,\" is clear. Furthermore, the fate of an atheist, who rejects even the belief in God, is even clearer and more evident. Finally, I hope that the matter is now clearer to you. I ask Allaah to guide us all to the truth and help us to follow it, for He is the best Supporter and Helper.\n",

Allah says: \"O mankind! A similitude has been coined, so listen to it (carefully): verily! Those on whom you call besides Allah cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly snatched away a thing from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.\"[al-Hajj 22:73] Imam al-Bukhari reported in his Saheeh from Abu Sa‘eed (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"There is no created being but Allah created it.\" In Arabic, the word \"khalaqa\" means to make out of nothing, which is something that only Allah can do; it is impossible for anyone except Allah to do this. It also carries the meaning of decreeing or foreordaining. [**] See Fath al-Bari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhari, 13/390. The Religion of Allah (Islam) is proud and cannot be defeated by the kaafirs’ arrogance about the knowledge they possess. Allah says: \". . .

I say that the fact that Allaah has blessed him with the position of imaam and the love of his people dictates that he should give up his sin and stop transgressing against himself, and he should worship Allaah properly, and give thanks to Allaah, because the fact that a person is loved by his people and is their imaam is a great blessing from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And the slaves of the Most Beneficient (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness… And those who say: ‘Our Lord… and make us leaders for the muttaqoon (the pious)…” [al-Furqaan 25:63-74] Those who pray are among the pious, and the one who leads them in prayer is imcluded in this aayah, “…and make us leaders for the muttaqoon (the pious)…” So let him praise Allaah for this blessing, and stop transgressing against himself, and let him make this one of the means of bringing himself back to obedience to Allaah, and let him fear Allaah with regard to his status. When he says that he is afraid he may show off, this is waswaas (insinuating thoughts) that the Shaytaan puts into a person’s mind whenever he wants to do an act of obedience to Allaah. The Shaytaan comes to him and says, “You are showing off.” He has to cast this idea aside, ignore it and seek the help of Allaah, for he always recites in his salaah the words, “Iyyaaka na’budu wa iyyaaka nasta’een (You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help” [al-Faatihah 1:5 – interpretation of the meaning].\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If a man is able to marry a second wife, physically and financially, and he can treat both wives in a just manner, and he wants to take a second wife, then he is allowed to do so according to Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… then marry (other) women of your choice, two or three, or four…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:3] And this was the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and of his Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them), but apart from the Prophet, no one is permitted to have more than four wives. It is well known that women are by nature jealous and reluctant to share their husband with other women. Women are not to be condemned for this jealousy, for it existed in thebest of righteous women, the Sahaabiyyaat, and even in the Mothers of the Believers [the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)]. But women should not let jealousy make them object to that which Allaah has prescribed, and they should not try to prevent it; a wife should allow her husband to marry another woman for this is a kind of cooperating in righteousness and piety. According to a hadeeth whose authenticity is agreed upon, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever pays attention to his brother’s needs, Allaah will pay attention to his needs.” The first wife’s consent is not a prerequisite for a man to take another wife. The Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas was asked about this and replied as follows: “It is not obligatory for the husband, if he wants to take a second wife, to have the consent of his first wife, but it is good manners and kindness to deal with her in such a manner that will reduce the hurt which women naturally feel in such situations. This is done by being kind to her and speaking to her in a gentle and pleasant manner, and by spending whatever money may be necessary in order to gain her acceptance of the situation.” Concerning her request for divorce if her husband wants to marry another wife, this is a mistake. But they should examine the situation, and if she really cannot cope with living with another wife, then she can ask him for khula’ [ a kind of divorce instigated by the wife, whereby she forgoes the mahr]. If she can cope with living with the second wife, but it hurts her to do so, then she should be patient and seek the pleasure of Allaah. Thawbaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman asks her husband for a divorce for no reason, but the fragrance of Paradise is forbidden for her.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood and others, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani, may Allaah have mercy on him). If she bears it with patience, then Allaah will make it easier for her and will expand her chest (i.e., grant her peace and calm), and will compensate her with something good. The husband must also help her by treating her kindly, being patient with her for any jealousy etc. on her part, and overlooking her mistakes. And Allaah is the source of help.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The Permanent Committee for Iftaa' (Islamic Rulings), chaired by Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baz, has replied to this question by ruling that it is not permissible to copy software without permission from the original author or the copyright holder based on the following three haadeeth of the Prophet (peace be upon him): (1) \"Muslims are to honor their agreements (with others)\"; (2) \"A Muslim's wealth is forbidden for others to use without his permission;\" and, (3) \"Whoever is the first to acquire a mubaah (something lawful to acquire) is entitled to keep it\". This applies to both Muslims and non-believers (who are not engaged in an act of war with Muslims) because the right of a non-believer is respected in the same manner as a Muslim's right. Allah knows best. (Committee Fatwa no: 18453) Also, Sheikh Muhammad bin Salih Al-'Uthaimeen has ruled that whatever is customary among people should be the rule except when a user wants a copy for himself and the author or the copyright holder did not explicitly prohibit copying the software for private or public use. However, if the author or the copyright holder specifically stated that private and public copying of the software is prohibited, then it is not permissible to copy that software.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. To the dear inquirer: We appreciate the question you have submitted, as it is an issue which is truly among those which may pose a hindrance in some cases for those who wish to adopt Islaam. In reality the issue is really simpler than many may think. Male circumcision is among the rites of Islaam and is part of the fitrah, or the innate disposition and natural character and instinct of the human creation, and is from the religion of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allaah has said (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then we revealed to you (the command) to follow the pure and uncorrupted religion of Ibrahim.\" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: \"The Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) was circumcisized when he was eighty years old.\" (Al-Bukhari, Vol 6/p. 388, Al-Salfiyya printing). Male circumcision is obligatory for the Muslim male if he is able to do it. If, however, he is unable, whether due to fear of injury or if a respected and authoritative doctor has told him he will experience profuse bleeding which may make his life miserable, then the obligation for cirumcision is waived and he does not commit a sin by not having it done. It is not permissible under any circumstance for the issue to become a hindrance for a person wanting to accept Islaam. The validity of one's acceptance of Islaam is not dependent on his performance of circumcision and it is valid for one to adopt Islaam even if he has not had himself circumcized. Regarding the issue of female circumcision, please refer to question # 328. I ask Allaah to bring you success in all that is good and to protect you from all that is evil, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad .\n",

Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullah reported that Abu Quhaafah was brought on the day of the conquest of Makkah, and his head and beard were white like \"thaghaamah\" (a plant whose flowers and fruit are white). The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"Change this with something, but avoid black.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 3962). Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ‘At the end of time there will be people who will dye their hair black like the crops of pigeons. They will never even smell the fragrance of Paradise.\" (reported by Imam Ahmad, see also Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no. 8153). It was also reported from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) that one should change grey hair, using any colour except black. Abu Dharr reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"The best things with which to change grey hair are henna and ‘katam’ (a plant similar to henna which is used as a dye).\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1675; he said: This is a saheeh hasan hadith). Dyeing hair with pure black dye is haram because the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"Avoid black,\" and because of the threat of punishment reported with regard to this matter. This ruling applies to both men and women. But if the black dye is mixed with another colour, so that it is no longer black, there is nothing wrong with it.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The basic reason for keeping the Ka'bah on ones left when performing tawaaf (circumbabulation) is to follow the suit of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Following the Prophet has been ordained in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): \"Obey the Prophet so that you may be blessed with mercy\" and \"Say (O Muhammad): if you really love Allaah, then follow my suit and Allaah will love you and grant you forgiveness of your sins\". The Prophet , furthermore, has said regarding the rituals of Hajj and Umrah, \"Follow my suit in performing your rituals\". (See Al-Nisaa'i as reported by Jaabir. Also, Sahih al-Jami', hadith No. 7882.) This should suffice as the reason for a Muslim to perform tawaaf around the Ka'bah in the way it is done, and we do not need other reasons that attempt to tie this act to the movement of galaxies and stars or the revolving of planets, etc. Muslims by nature must believe, submit to and act according to what was validly and duly recorded as the behavior or statements of the Prophet. If on top of this a reason or some relevant wisdom comes to be known, then so be it, thanks to Allaah. Otherwise, a Muslim submits to the order of Allaah and His prophet and will accordingly be recompensed for his compliance and deeds. Finally, we must note that circumbabulation is an act specified only for the Ka'bah as part of the worship and is not to be done in other places or situations as such.

Such acts invent a way to worship Allaah which was not revealed or taught by Islam. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Whoever innovates in our religion a new act (of worship) then his act is rejected\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Fath al-Baari No. 2697.) The best guidance is that of the Prophet . There is no allowance for innovation in the religion of Allaah. Is it possible for us to discover new things in our religion that the Prophet didnt know? Indeed, it is incumbent upon us to read the Koran in the way the Prophet read it, we need to pray in the way he prayed, and glorify Allaahs name in the way the Prophet has been validly reported to have done.

But more importantly, we offer remembrance of Allaah's blessings, celebrate His name and offer the eid salaat (prayer).

Of course, there are other joyous occasions for which the Islamic shariah dictates appropriate celebration, such as gathering for special meals during weddings or on the occasion of the birth of a child (aqeeqah).

Through it, man can help in the development and civilization of this earth, and through it man can ponder the signs of Allaah's creation. Accordingly, Muslims have concentrated on the study of this universe and made great strides in the fields of medicine, astronomy, mathematics, physics, etc. However, the specifics of these contributions are not the area of concentration for Muslim scholars, and there are perhaps better sources than this forum to explain the role of Muslim scientists, such as books written for this specific purpose.

      "Contents Related Divorce in Islam When can a woman ask for divorce? Seeking divorce for no reason Does the Throne of Allah shake because of divorce? Praise be to Allah.Divorce in Islam The divorce of a Muslim woman from her husband is an affair which is loathsome to Allah and not a praiseworthy event. This is due to the problems and possible evils. When can a woman ask for divorce? However, if there is a situation in the marital life taking place between the man and the woman, due to a defect or defects in one or both of them, such as problems of Din, bad character, sickness, or a defect such as being sterile or similar, then out of the mercy of Allah, seeking divorce is permissible. In this case, it is okay and there is nothing prohibited in seeking a divorce . Seeking divorce for no reason The thing which is prohibited is a wife seeking a divorce from her husband for no (valid) reason in the Shari’ah. There is a serious promise made for seeking a divorce without a valid reason. It is reported in the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), \"If a woman asks her husband for a divorce, for no reason, then the smell of Paradise is forbidden for her\". (At-Tirmidhi narrated it. He said this is a hasan hadith. Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 1187.) Does the Throne of Allah shake because of divorce?

      "Contents Related What do Muslims believe about Jesus? Creation of Jesus Miracles of Jesus Was Jesus crucified? Praise be to Allah.What do Muslims believe about Jesus? Muslims respect and revere Jesus (peace be upon him), and await his second coming. They consider him one of the greatest of God’s messengers to mankind. A Muslim never refers to him simply as `Jesus', but always adds the phrase \"peace be upon him.\" Creation of Jesus The Quran confirms his virgin birth (a chapter of the Quran is entitled `Mary') in her time, and Mary is considered the purest woman in all creation. The Quran describes the creation of Jesus as follows (interpretation of the meaning): \"Behold! the Angel said, `God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you glad tidings of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and the Hereafter, and one that shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of the righteous.' She said: `O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: `Even so; God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He but says to it, \"Be!\" and it is.\" (Al Imran 3:42-7) Jesus (peace be upon him) was born miraculously through the same power which had brought Adam (peace be upon him) into being without a father: \"Truly, the likeness of Jesus unto Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then said to him, `Be!' and he was.\" (Al Imran 3:59) Miracles of Jesus During his prophetic mission, Jesus (peace be upon him) was granted and performed many miracles. The Quran tells us that he said (interpretation of meaning): \"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by Allah’s leave. And I heal the blind and the lepers, and I raise the dead by Allah’s leave.\" (Al Imran 3:49) Other miracles include speaking soon after birth in defense of his mother's piety. God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, and, most importantly, the message he was carrying. Was Jesus crucified? These miracles were granted to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified , but it only appeared so; instead, Allah raised him unto Heaven. (An-Nisa 4:157) Neither Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), nor Jesus (peace be upon him), came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in one God , brought by earlier prophets, but to confirm and renew it. In the Quran Jesus (peace be upon him), is reported as saying that he came: \"To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me.\" (al Imran 3:50) And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Just as illicit sexual relations can occur between men, they can also occur between women. The Muslim fuqahaa call this sihaaq (lesbianism), which they define as sexual relations between one woman and another (al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Marah by Zaydaan, 5/450), and state that it is a punishable offence (the punishment is a form of discipline for disobedience; no specific punishment is given in the Quraan, so the punishment is to be set by the Qaadi according to the circumstances of the crime and the one who commits it). The lesbians testimony is unacceptable because she is a evildoer (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 24/253). Ibn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"If two women masturbate one another, then they are cursed fornicators\" (al-Mughni 10/162). Some of the scholars, like al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salaam say that a lesbian is not permitted to look at a Muslim woman, and that a Muslim woman is not permitted to uncover (take off her hijaab) in front of a lesbian, because she is an evildoer who cannot be trusted not to describe her to others. If what is described above is the nature of the relationship between the two women mentioned in the question, then they must repent sincerely to Allaah and stop their evil actions. If their being together in one place will lead to them committing this sin, then they must never meet, so as to avoid this wrongful act. Their husbands desertion of them may be one of the reasons for them falling into this kind of perversion, because they have no legitimate way in which to fulfil their desires and so they have resorted to this haraam way. So they must think seriously of finding Muslim husbands with whom they can live in the way prescribed by Islaam. As for love, this is a different kind of sin, which need not necessarily be associated with physical desire. It is dangerous because it leads to the lover worshipping the beloved, so that he thinks only of the one he loves, cannot bear to be parted from him by day and dreams about him at night; he lives and dies for his sake, and may change when he sees him and become sick when he is absent. This kind of relationship destroys a persons mental health and destroys his relationship with his Lord, because it makes the lover worship his beloved and it is haraam to worship anything other than Allaah. The solution to this disastrous situation is total separation, so that one will never see that person, or hear news of him again.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The first question may appear strange and somewhat surprising to committed, practising Muslims. How can something which is so obviously one of the bases of Islaam become a matter for discussion and debate? But since the question has been asked, we will present, with the help of Allaah, the principles and bases of the importance of the Sunnah, the obligation to follow it and the ruling concerning those who reject it. By so doing, we will also refute the doubters and the misguided group who call themselves “Qur’aaniyyeen” (the Qur’aan has nothing to do with them!) In sha Allaah this discussion will be of benefit to everyone who wants to understand the truth of the matter. Proof of the importance of the Sunnah (1) The Qur’aan speaks of the importance of the Sunnah, for example: (a) Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “He who obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allaah . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:80] Allaah described obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as being a part of obedience to Him. Then He made a connection between obedience to Him and obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him): “O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:59] (b) Allaah warns us not to go against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and states that whoever disobeys him will be doomed to eternal Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “. . . And let those who oppose the Messenger’s commandment beware, lest some fitnah (trial, affliction, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.” [al-Nur 24:63] (c) Allaah has made obedience to His Prophet a religious duty; resisting or opposing it is a sign of hypocrisy: “”But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you [Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:65] (d) Allaah commands His slaves to respond to Him and His Messenger: “O you who believe! Answer Allaah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life . . .” [al-Anfaal 8:24] (e) Allaah also commands His slaves to refer all disputes to him: “. . . (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger . . .” [al-Nisaa’ 4:59] (2) The Sunnah itself indicates the importance of the Sunnah. For example: (a) Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi’ and others that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “I do not want to see any one of you reclining on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying ‘I don’t accept it; we didn’t find any such thing in the Book of Allaah.’” Abu ‘Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Shaakir edition, no. 2663). Al-’Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Would any of you think, reclining on his couch, that Allaah would only describe what is forbidden in the Qur’aan? I tell you, by Allaah, that I have warned and commanded and prohibited things that are as important as what is in the Qur’aan, if not more so.” (Reported by Abu Dawud, Kitaab al-Khiraj wa’l-imaarah wa’l-fay’). (b) Abu Dawud also reported from al-’Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, that “the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) led us in prayer one day, then he turned to us and exhorted us strongly . . . (he said), ‘Pay attention to my sunnah (way) and the way of the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me, adhere to it and hold fast to it.’” (Saheeh Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Sunnah). (3) The scholars’ consensus (ijmaa’) affirming the importance of the Sunnah. Al-Shaafi’i, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “I do not know of anyone among the Sahaabah and Taabi’een who narrated a report from the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) without accepting it, adhering to it and affirming that this was sunnah. Those who came after the Taabi’een, and those whom we met did likewise: they all accepted the reports and took them to be sunnah, praising those who followed them and criticizing those who went against them. Whoever deviated from this path would be regarded by us as having deviated from the way of the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the scholars who followed them, and would be considered as one of the ignorant. (4) Common sense indicates the importance of the Sunnah. The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allaah indicates that we must believe everything he said and obey every command he gave. It goes without saying that he has told us things and given instructions in addition to what is in the Qur’aan. It is futile to make a distinction between the Sunnah and the Qur’aan when it comes to adhering to it and responding to it. It is obligatory to believe in what he has told us, and to obey his instructions. The ruling concerning those who deny the importance of the Sunnah is that they are kaafirs, because they deny and reject a well-known and undeniable part of the religion. As regards your second question, about whether a Muslim is required to follow a particular madhhab, the answer is that he does not have to. For the average “rank and file” Muslim, his madhhab is that of his mufti or the scholar whom he consults for religious verdicts; he must ask those pious scholars whom he trusts for opinions when necessary. If a person has enough knowledge to distinguish which evidence and opinion is stronger, then he must follow the scholarly opinion which has the strongest support from the Qur’an and Sunnah. It is acceptable for a Muslim to follow one of the four well-known madhhabs, on the condition that he understands that the truth in any given issue may lie with another madhhab, in which case he must ignore his own madhhab’s opinion and follow the truth. The Muslim’s aim is to follow the truth that is in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah. The madhhabs of fiqh are only a means of reaching ahkaam (rules) based on the Qur’aan and Sunnah, they are not Qur’aan and Sunnah. We ask Allaah to show us the truth and help us to follow it, and to show us falsehood and help us to avoid it. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If you are asking about the names of books on the field of Islamic psychology, the answer is that unfortunately there are still very few modern books in this field. There is a need for people who have studied the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and who have an insight into and practical experience of human psychology, as well as knowledge of the experience and writings of non-Muslims in this field, to write about this subject properly and produce useful work in this field. In any case, there are a few modern books in this field, which include the following: ‘Ilm al-Nafs al-Da’wi (The Psychology of Da’wah) by ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Muhammad al-Naghmeeshi Madkhil ila al-Tarbiyah al-Islamiyah (Introduction to Islamic Education) by ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Yaami Usas al-Sihhah al-Nafsiyyah li’l-Tifl al-Muslim (Principles of Psychological Health of the Muslim Child) by Maalik Badri Al-Tafakkur min al-Mushaahadah ila’l-Shuhood: Diraasat Nafsiyah Islamiyah (From Seeing to Bearing Witness: A Study in Islamic Psychology) by Maalik Badri ‘Ilm al-Nafs al-Ta’leemi (Educational Psychology) by Muhammad Khaleefah Barakaat Araa’ Ibn al-Qayyim al-Tarbawiyah (The Educational Thought of Ibn al-Qayyim) by Hasan ‘Ali Hasan al-Hijaaji Diraasaat fi’l-Nafs al-Insaaniyah (Studies in Human Psychology) by Muhammad Qutb Manhaj al-Tarbiyah al-Islamiyah (Methodology of Islamic Education) (2 vols.) by Muhammad Qutb ‘Ilm al-Nafs fi Hayaatinaa al-Yawmiyah (Everyday Psychology) by Muhammad ‘Uthmaan Najaati ‘Ilm al-Nafs al-Takweeni (Formative Psychology) by ‘Abd al-Hameed Muhammad al-Haashimi Al-Muraahiqoon (Teenagers) by ‘Abd al-‘Azeez Muhammad al-Naghmeeshi Usool ‘Ilm al-Nafs al-‘Aam (Principles of General Psychology) by ‘Abd al-Hameed Muhammad al-Haashimi The first reference given will give you more details about these references, in sha Allaah.

      "Praise be to Allah.It is a feature of literary style in Arabic that a person may refer to himself by the pronoun nahnu (we) for respect or glorification. He may also use the word ana (I), indicating one person, or the third person huwa (he). All three styles are used in the Qur’an, where Allaah addresses the Arabs in their own tongue. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 4/143). “Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, sometimes refers to Himself in the singular, by name or by use of a pronoun, and sometimes by use of the plural, as in the phrase (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Verily, We have given you a manifest victory” [al-Fath 48:1], and other similar phrases. But Allaah never refers to Himself by use of the dual, because the plural refers to the respect that He deserves, and may refer to His names and attributes, whereas the dual refers to a specific number (and nothing else), and He is far above that.” (Al-‘Aqeedah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 75). These words, innaa (“Verily We”) and nahnu (“We”), and other forms of the plural, may be used by one person speaking on behalf of a group, or they may be used by one person for purposes of respect or glorification, as is done by some monarchs when they issue statements or decrees in which they say “We have decided…” etc. [This is known in English as “The Royal We” – Translator]. In such cases, only one person is speaking but the plural is used for respect. The One Who is more deserving of respect than any other is Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, so when He says in the Qur’an innaa (“Verily We”) and nahnu (“We”), it is for respect and glorification, not to indicate plurality of numbers. If an aayah of this type is causing confusion, it is essential to refer to the clear, unambiguous aayaat for clarification, and if a Christian, for example, insists on taking ayaat such as “Verily, We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Qur’an)” [al-Hijr 15:9 – interpretation of the meaning] as proof of divine plurality, we may refute this claim by quoting such clear and unambiguous aayaat as (interpretation of the meanings): “And your god is One God, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful” [al-Baqarah 2:163] and “Say: He is Allaah, the One” [al-Ikhlaas 112:1] – and other aayaat which can only be interpreted in one way. Thus confusion will be dispelled for the one who is seeking the truth. Every time Allaah uses the plural to refer to Himself, it is based on the respect and honour that He deserves, and on the great number of His names and attributes, and on the great number of His troops and angels.” (Reference: Al-‘Aqeedah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 109).

Praise be to Allah.All address to men in the Quran is address to women Since you believe in Allah and His Book, you must know that {and not one will thy Lord treat with injustice}, Verse 49, Surat al-Kahf, or the Cave, and {Allah is never unjust in the least degree: if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from His Own Self a great reward}, Verse 40, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women. (Translation of the meanings) Allah has meant this Law of Islam (Shari'ah) for both men and women. All address to men in the Quran is address to women as well, and all rules affecting men affect women as well unless evidence is established that one of them is meant and not the other as in the rules relating to Jihad (fighting for Islam), menstruation, custodianship, rule etc. The evidence that women are included in Verses of the Quran in the male gender is a Hadith by ‘Aishah who said that the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) was asked about a man who sees traces of semen but does not remember having any dream of a sexual nature. The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Such a man should perform the Ghusl (ritual bath).” He was also asked of a man who remembers a dream of a sexual nature but sees no traces of semen. He said: \"Such a man does not have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath). Umm Salim said \"A woman may have the same experience. Does she have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath)?\" The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"Yes, there is no difference in this between man and woman.\" (Narrated by Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi 113 and others. The last phrase is in Sahih al-Jami’ under No. 2333) What will women get in Jannah? With respect to rewards in the Hereafter and what women have in Heaven , we include a number of Verses and Hadiths as follows: Umm Salamah said: \"O Messenger of Allah. I did not hear a Verse in the Quran regarding the Hijrah (migration with the Prophet) of women.\" Then was revealed the Verse: {And their Lord has accepted of them, and answered them: Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: ye are members, one of another: those who have left their homes, and were driven out therefrom, and suffered harm in My cause, and fought and were slain, verily I will blot out from them their inequities, and admit them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath; ... A reward from Allah, and from Allah is the best of rewards.}, Verse 195, Surat al-Imran, or the Family (translation of the meaning). The Hadith was narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3023. Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse {fastajaba lahum rabbuhum} means Allah replied to their queries ... and the Verse {anni la udi’u ‘amala ‘amilin minkum min thakarin aw untha} is an explanation of the reply meaning that good deeds will not be lost or ignored. All men and women will have the just reward for their deeds. The Verse {ba’dukum min ba’d} means you will be treated equally with respect to rewards . {If any do deeds of righteousness, be they male or female, and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them.}, Verse 124, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women (translation of the meaning). In explanation of this Verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse shows Allah’s kindness, generosity and mercy in accepting the good deeds of all people, men and women, provided that they believe, in allowing them into Heaven and in not decreasing rewards for their good deeds, not even in the least. {Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has faith, verily, to him will we give a life that is good and pure, and we will bestow on such their reward according to the best of actions.}, Verse 97, Surat an-Nahl, or the Bees (translation of the meaning). Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said this is a promise by Allah, the Exalted, to those who do good deeds i.e. deeds acceptable to Allah in which a Muslim follows the rules set in the Book of Allah, the Exalted, and the Sunnah of His Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him), be they men or women, if they believe in Allah and His Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him), that He will make them live a good life in this world and will be rewarded in the Hereafter. A good life would include all types of comfort. {He that makes evil will not be requited but by the like thereof; and he that makes a righteous deed whether man or woman and is a believer, such will enter the garden (of bliss): therein will they have abundance without measure.}, Verse 40, Surat al-Muminun, or the believers (translation of the meaning). Finally; Dear Sister, here is a Hadith that will dispel any doubt you may have with respect to the mentioning of women: Umm Umarah al-Ansariyyah said that she went to the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) and said to Him: \"I feel that everything is for men. Women are not mentioned as having anything. Then was revealed the Verse (translation of the meaning): {For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women etc}, Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates. The Hadith is narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3211, and is in Sahih at-Tirmidhi under No. 2565. In the collection of Hadiths of Imam Ahmad was narrated the Hadith that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: \"I said \"O Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) of Allah. Why aren’t we mentioned in the Quran in an equal footing with men?\" Then; I was surprised to hear Him call one day from the pulpit: \"O people.\" As I was combing my hair at the moment, I wrapped it up and came close to the door and stood there listening to him say: \"Allah, Mighty and Sublime be He, revealed that (in meaning) {For Muslim men and women; for believing men and women; for devout men and women, for true men and women; for men and women who are patient and constant; for men and women who humble themselves; for men and women who give in charity; for men and women who fast; for men and women who guard their chastity; and for men and women who engage much in Allah's remembrance, for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.} Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates.

Do more naafil (supererogatory or extra) prayers to make up for the fard (obligatory) prayers that you have missed, as was advised in the saheeh hadeeth narrated by Hurayth ibn Qubaysah, who said: I came to Madeenah and prayed, O Allaah, send me a righteous companion. I went and sat with Abu Hurayrah and said: I asked Allaah to bless me with a righteous companion; tell me a hadeeth that you heard from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that I may benefit therefrom. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that the first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayer. If it is sound, he will be successful, and if it is lacking in any way, he will be doomed. If his obligatory prayers are lacking, the Lord will say: Look and see whether My slave has any voluntary prayers which may be used to make up what is lacking in his obligatory prayers. Then all his deeds will be examined and dealt with in the same way. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 413; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 2020). Abu Dawood reported from Anas ibn Hakeem al-Dabbi that he came to Madeenah and met Abu Hurayrah. He said: He asked me about my lineage so I told him about it, then he said: O young man, shall I not tell you a hadeeth? I said, Of course, may Allaah have mercy on you, and I think he mentioned it from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said: The first thing that people will be asked about on the Day of Resurrection will be their prayers. Our Lord will say to His angels (although He knows best): Look at My slaves prayers: are they complete or is something lacking? If they are complete, they will be recorded as such, but if something is lacking, He will say: Look and see if My slave has any voluntary prayers to his credit. If this proves to be the case, He will say: Make up his (missing) obligatory prayers with his voluntary prayers. Then the rest of his deeds will be dealt with in the same manner.

It is, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “The greatest day in the sight of Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, the Day of Sacrifice . . .” (Reported by Abu Dawud; see also Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 1064). It is also the greatest day of Hajj, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) told us. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, see Saheeh al-Jaami‘, 8191). The reason why it is described as the greatest day of the year is that it combines so many acts of worship which are not combined on any other day, such as the Eid prayer, offering the sacrifice, reciting Takbeer (glorifying Allaah), and widespread remembrance of Allaah. For the pilgrims in Makkah, it also includes offering a sacrifice, stoning the pillars representing Shaytaan (the devil), shaving the head (for men only; women merely cut a little off their hair), and performing Tawaaf (circumambulation of the Ka‘bah) and Sa‘ee (running between the two hills of Safaa and Marwa).\n",

It is not permissible for a person to claim to belong to anyone other than his father, because this leads to further lies, and has an impact on matters of inheritance, who is considered to be a mahram, and all other issues that have to do with lineage. Thus the texts issue stern warnings to those who claim to belong to anyone other than their fathers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever claims to belong to anyone other than his father on him will be the curse of Allaah and the angels and all the people. (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2599; Saheeh al-Jaami, 6104). This action is also a major sin comprised of two major sins, lying in order to consume wealth unlawfully and claiming to belong to someone other than one's father. This person has to go back to what is true, and give up the nationality he aquired improperly. He should go back to using his proper documents that prove his real lineage. This is obligatory upon him. I am astounded that anyone would do such a thing for worldly gains.

      "Praise be to Allah. Wearing gold is haraam for men. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw a gold ring on a man’s hand. He took it off and threw it aside, saying, \"Would any of you take a burning coal and hold it in his hand?\" When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had gone away, someone said to the man, \"Take your ring and benefit from it (i.e., sell it).\" He said, \"No, by Allaah, I will not take it after the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has thrown it away.\" (reported by Muslim, no. 2090). ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al’Aas reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever of my ummah wears gold and dies wearing it, Allaah will deny him the gold of Paradise. Whoever of my ummah wears silk and dies wearing it, Allaah will deny him the silk of Paradise.\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad). This prohibition applies to men only, not to women, as ‘Ali, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took a piece of silk in his right hand and a piece of gold in his left, and said: \"These are forbidden for the males of my ummah.\" (reported by al-Nisaa’i and Abu Dawud). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: \"Wearing silk and gold is permitted for the women of my ummah and prohibited for the males.\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad) Gold is permitted for women because of their delicate and gentle nature, and their need for adornment. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"(Do they then like for Allaah) a creature who is brought up in adornments (wearing gold and silk ornaments, i.e., women), and in dispute cannot make herself clear?\" [al-Zukhruf 43:18] As for men, it is a sign of instability and an unmasculine nature to adorn oneself with gold. Islaam wants the differences between the sexes to be marked clearly, and their distinct characteristics to stand out, because when they resemble one another, much corruption results therefrom. The prohibition of gold for men includes pure gold, gold alloys, cut pieces, joined pieces, gold inlay, etc. As for gold-plating and gilding, some scholars are of the opinion that such articles are forbidden for men if it is possible to extract gold from them (by peeling or shaving off, for example); if no gold can be extracted from it, then such items are permitted. Some scholars say that it is not permitted to wear an item which is wholly or mostly gold-plated, but if only a little part of it is gold-plated (like the hands of a watch, or the numerals, or the tiny points denoting numbers), then it is permitted to wear it. They say that the issue is its appearance, not its value: if the gold-plating is very obvious and covers everything, it is not permitted, because many people will not make the distinction between gold-plate and real gold, and some may follow this person’s example and begin to wear pure gold.

If he said \"I seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan,\" what he feels (i.e., his anger) would go away.’\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 6/337) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If a man gets angry and says, ‘I seek refuge with Allah ,’ his anger will go away.\" (Sahih al-Jami’ al-Saghir, no. 695) Keeping silent The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If any of you becomes angry, let him keep silent.\" (Reported by Imam Ahmad, al-Musnad, 1/329; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 693, 4027) This is because, in most cases, the angry person loses self-control and could utter words of kufr/disbelief (from which we seek refuge with Allah), or curses, or the word of divorce (talaq) which would destroy his home, or words of slander which would bring him the enmity and hatred of others. So, in short, keeping silent is the solution which helps one to avoid all that. Not moving The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"If any of you becomes angry and he is standing, let him sit down, so his anger will go away; if it does not go away, let him lie down.\" The narrator of this hadith is Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), and there is a story connected to his telling of it: he was taking his camels to drink at a trough that he owned, when some other people came along and said (to one another), \"Who can compete with Abu Dharr (in bringing animals to drink) and make his hair stand on end?\" A man said, \"I can,\" so he brought his animals and competed with Abu Dharr, with the result that the trough was broken. [i.e., Abu Dharr was expecting help in watering his camels, but instead the man misbehaved and caused the trough to be broken]. Abu Dharr was standing, so he sat down, then he laid down. Someone asked him, \"O Abu Dharr, why did you sit down then lie down?\" He said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: . . .\" and quoted the hadith. (The hadith and this story may be found in Musnad Ahmad, 5/152; see also Sahih al-Jami’, no. 694). According to another report, Abu Dharr was watering his animals at the trough, when another man made him angry, so he sat down . . . (Fayd al-Qadir, al-Manawi, 1/408) Among the benefits of this advice given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the fact that it prevents the angry person from going out of control, because he could strike out and injure someone, or even kill - as we will find out shortly - or he could destroy possessions and so on. Sitting down makes it less likely that one will become overexcited. Lying down makes it even less likely that he will do something crazy or harmful. Al-’Allamah al-Khattabi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his commentary on Abu Dawud: \"One who is standing is in a position to strike and destroy, while the one who is sitting is less likely to do that, and the one who is lying down can do neither. It is possible that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told the angry person to sit down or lie down so that he would not do something that he would later regret. And Allah knows best.\" (Sunan Abi Dawud, with Ma'alim al-Sunan, 5/141) Following the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), \"Advise me.\" He said, \"Do not become angry.\" The man repeated his request several times, and each time the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him, \"Do not become angry.\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath al-Bari, 10/456) According to another report, the man said: \"I thought about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, and I realized that anger combines all kinds of evil.\" (Musnad Ahmad, 5/373) Do not become angry and Paradise will be yours This is an authentic hadith. (See Sahih al-Jami’, 7374. Ibn Hijr attributed it to al-Tabarani, see al-Fath 4/465) Remembering what Allah has promised to the righteous (muttaqin) who keep away from the causes of anger and struggle within themselves to control it, is one of the most effective ways of extinguishing the flames of anger. One of the hadiths that describe the great reward for doing this is: \"Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will fill his heart with contentment on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Reported by al-Tabarani, 12/453, see also Sahih al-Jami’, 6518). Another great reward is described in the Prophet’s words: \"Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will call him before all of mankind on the Day of Resurrection, and will let him choose of the Hur al-’Iyn whoever he wants.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud, 4777, and others. It is classified as hasan (sound) in Sahih al-Jami’, 6518) Knowing the high status and advantages offered to those who control themselves The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"The strong man is not the one who can overpower others (in wrestling); rather, the strong man is the one who controls himself when he gets angry.\" (Reported by Ahmad, 2/236; the hadith is agreed upon). The greater the anger, the higher the status of the one who controls himself. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"The strongest man is the one who, when he gets angry and his face reddens and his hackles rise, is able to defeat his anger.\" (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 5/367, and classified as hasan in Sahih al-Jami’, 3859) Anas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by some people who were wrestling. He asked, \"What is this?\" They said: \"So-and-So is the strongest, he can beat anybody.\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, \"Shall I not tell you who is even stronger than him? The man who, when he is mistreated by another, controls his anger, has defeated his own shaytan and the shaytan of the one who made him angry.\" (Reported by al-Bazzar, and Ibn Hijr said its isnad is sahih. Al-Fath, 10/519) Following the Prophet’s example in the case of anger The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is our leader and has set the highest example in this matter, as is recorded in a number of hadiths. One of the most famous was reported by Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: \"I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he was wearing a Najrani cloak with a rough collar. A Bedouin came and seized him roughly by the edge of his cloak, and I saw the marks left on his neck by the collar. Then the Bedouin ordered him to give him some of the wealth of Allah that he had. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned to him and smiled, then ordered that he should be given something.\" (Agreed upon. Fath al-Bari, 10/375) Another way in which we can follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is by making our anger for the sake of Allah, when His rights are violated. This is the kind of anger which is praiseworthy. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) became angry when he was told about the imam who was putting people off the prayer by making it too long; when he saw a curtain with pictures of animate creatures in ‘Aishah’s house; when Usamah spoke to him about the Makhzumi woman who had been convicted of theft, and he said \"Do you seek to intervene concerning one of the punishments prescribed by Allah?\"; when he was asked questions that he disliked, and so on. His anger was purely for the sake of Allah. Knowing that resisting anger is one of the signs of righteousness The righteous (al-muttaqun) are those praised by Allah in the Quran and by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Paradise as wide as heaven and earth has been prepared for them. One of their characteristics is that they (interpretation of the meaning) \"spend (in Allah’s Cause) in prosperity and in adversity, [they] repress anger, and [they] pardon men; verily, Allah loves al-muhsinun (the good-doers).\" [Al ‘Imran 3:134] These are the ones whose good character and beautiful attributes and deeds Allah has mentioned, and whom people admire and want to emulate. One of their characteristics is that (interpretation of the meaning) \". . . when they are angry, they forgive.\" [al-Shura 42:37] Listening to reminders Anger is a part of human nature, and people vary in their anger. It may be difficult for a man not to get angry, but sincere people will remember Allah when they are reminded, and they will not overstep the mark. Some examples follow: Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man sought permission to speak to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), then he said: \"O son of al-Khattab, you are not giving us much and you are not judging fairly between us.\" ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was so angry that he was about to attack the man, but al-Hurr ibn Qays, who was one of those present, said: \"O Amir al-Mu’minin, Allah said to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish’ [al-A’raf 7:199]. This man is one of the foolish.\" By Allah, ‘Umar could go no further after al-Hurr had recited this ayah to him, and he was a man who was careful to adhere to the Book of Allah. (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 4/304) This is how the Muslim should be. The evil hypocrite was not like this when he was told the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and one of the Companions said to him, \"Seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan.\" He said to the one who reminded him, \"Do you think I am crazy? Go away!\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 1/465). We seek refuge with Allah from failure. Knowing the bad effects of anger The negative effects of anger are many; in short they cause damage to one’s own self and to others. The angry person may utter words of slander and obscenity, he may attack others (physically) in an uncontrolled manner, even to the point of killing. The following story contains a valuable lesson: `Alqamah ibn Wail reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) told him: \"I was sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when a man came to him leading another man by a rope. He said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, this man killed my brother.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, ‘Did you kill him?’ He said, ‘Yes, I killed him.’ He asked, ‘How did you kill him?’ He said, ‘He and I were hitting a tree to make the leaves fall, for animal feed, and he slandered me, so I struck him on the side of the head with an axe, and killed him.’ . . .\" (Reported by Muslim, 1307, edited by al-Baqi) Anger could lead to less than killing, such as wounding and breaking bones. If the one who caused the anger runs away, the angry person turns his anger on himself, so he may tear his clothes, or strike his cheeks, or have a fit, or fall unconscious, or he may break dishes and plates, or break furniture. In the worst cases, anger results in social disasters and the breaking of family ties, i.e., divorce. Ask many of those who divorced their wives, and they will tell you: it was in a moment of anger. This divorce results in misery for the children, regret and frustration, a hard and difficult life, all as a result of anger. If they had remembered Allah, come to their senses, restrained their anger and sought refuge with Allah, none of this would have happened. Going against the shari’ah (Islamic law) only results in loss. The damage to health that results from anger can only be described by doctors, such as thrombosis, high blood pressure, tachycardia (abnormally rapid heartbeat) and hyperventilation (rapid, shallow breathing), which can lead to fatal heart attacks, diabetes, etc. We ask Allah for good health. The angry person should think about himself during moments of anger If the angry person could see himself in the mirror when he is angry, he would hate himself and the way he looks. If he could see the way he changes, and the way his body and limbs shake, how his eyes glare and how out of control and crazy his behaviour is, he would despise himself and be revolted by his own appearance. It is well-known that inner ugliness is even worse than outer ugliness; how happy the Shaytan must be when a person is in this state! We seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan and from failure. Du`a (Supplication) Du`a is always the weapon of the believer, whereby he asks Allah to protect him from evil, trouble and bad behaviour and seeks refuge with Him from falling into the pit of kufr (disbelief) or wrongdoing because of anger. One of the three things that can help save him is: being fair at times of contentment and of anger (Sahih al-Jami’, 3039). One of the Du`as of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was: \"O Allah, by Your knowledge of the Unseen and Your power over Your creation, keep me alive for as long as You know life is good for me, and cause me to die when You know death is good for me. O Allah, I ask You to make me fear You in secret and in public, and I ask You to make me speak the truth in times of contentment and of anger. I ask You not to let me be extravagant in poverty or in prosperity. I ask You for continuous blessings, and for contentment that does not end. I ask You to let me accept Your decree, and for a good life after death. I ask You for the joy of seeing Your face and for the longing to meet You, without going through diseases and misguiding fitnah (trials). O Allah, adorn us with the adornment of faith and make us among those who are guided. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\" For more about issues related to anger, please see these answers: 42505 , 22034 and 82400 . And Allah knows best.\n",

The second option you have is that she converts to Islam and then you marry her.

      "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. There is absolutely nothing wrong with calling the athaan in the musallah; on the contrary, it is better than abandoning it altogether. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught two men who were traveling how to make the call for prayer while traveling, where no mosques or musallahs may be found. As was narrated in the hadeeth saheah by Malik Ibn Al-Huwayrith: \"My cousin and I came to the Prophet SAWS and he said to us, ‘If you travel, (meaning while you are traveling) perform the call for prayer, and call the iqamah before prayer and let the older one of you be the Imam.\" Narrated by Al Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari hadeeth #658 and Al Tirmidhi, hadeeth #189. According to Abu Eissa (Al Tirmidhi) this hadeeth is hasan saheeh. There were two views on the hadeeth. The majority of the Muslim scholars agreed on the validity of calling the aathaan while traveling. Others however, have said that the iqamah alone is sufficient, and that the purpose of the aathaan is to gather people for prayer. According to Ahmad and Ishaaq, the first view is more sound. In another Hadeeth narrated by ‘Ukbah bin ‘Aamir he said: I heard the Prophet say, \"Allaah is pleased by a shepherd who, while on the top of a mountain, calls for prayer and prays. Allaah the Almighty says, ‘Look at my worshipperhe calls the aathaan, and he prays; he fears me. I have forgiven my worshipper, and I have sent him to heaven ( meaning that Allah chose for this person to go to heaven).’\" Narrated by Al-Nisaa’i, Abu Dawood, and Ahmad and was confirmed sound by Al Albany in his book Saheeh Al-Jami’, Hadeeth #8102. The benefits of the aathaan are many and they are by no means limited to gathering people, or announcing prayer time. They encompass: repelling Satan, getting rewarded in the afterlife for calling for prayer, and furthermore, for announcing and repeating the oneness of Allaah, etc. Allaah knows best.\n",

He says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And marry those among you who are single (i.e. a man who has no wife and a woman who has no husband) and (also marry) the saalihoon (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves). If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.

The conditions for a non-Muslim woman to marry a Muslim man are that she should be of the People of the Book (Jewish or Christian) and that she should be chaste. We remind the Muslims living outside the Muslim world that they should not rush into taking such a step, and if they wish to do so, they should think long and hard, even though marrying a woman of the People of the Book is permitted in principle.

      "Praise be to Allah. This is a wonderful thing for such a young person (11 years old) living in a non-Muslim country and deviant society to accomplish. The fact that she has not given her name is a sign of sincerity, in sha Allaah. I think that this should only be announced for the purposes of encouraging others to do the same. The affair should be limited to a small gathering where some relatives or friends invite a few of the girl’s friends, tell them of her achievement in completing the Qur’aan in order to encourage them - not to show off or boast - and some of the mothers say a few words about the greatness of the Qur’aan, the importance of reading it and how the Muslim should treat the Qur’aan. Or this girl could invite her friends to a meal to mark the occasion and give thanks for this blessing. There is nothing wrong with such activities, as long as one is careful not to let it turn into a celebration. It is clear from the above that celebrating a person’s completion of reciting or memorizing the Qur’aan, inviting people and offering food, is an action in which there is a risk of two fitnahs (temptations): (1) that it might be an occasion for showing off and boasting, and (2) that it may constitute bid’ah, if people believe that such celebrations are part of the religion and must be held every time a person completes the reading of the Qur’aan. The first danger may be avoided by striving within oneself to be sincere towards Allaah, and the second by restricting the invitees to a small number of family and friends. We should not hold such gatherings regularly, lest people think it is a part of the Sunnah I ask Allaah to increase His blessings upon you and to give you the strength to memorize Qur’aan and Sincerity in speech and deeds.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. The punishment for apostasy (riddah) is well-known in Islaamic Sharee’ah. The one who leaves Islaam will be asked to repent by the Sharee’ah judge in an Islaamic country; if he does not repent and come back to the true religion, he will be killed as a kaafir and apostate, because of the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \"Whoever changes his religion, kill him.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3017). It is well-known in Sharee’ah that the punishments (hudood) are not carried out on minors, because they have not yet reached the age of responsibility; but in the case of those who have reached the age of responsibility, the punishment (hadd) applies, without a doubt. The person who knows the truth and believes in it, then turns his back on it, does not deserve to live. The punishment for apostasy is prescribed for the protection of the religion and as a deterrent to anyone who is thinking of leaving Islaam. There is no doubt that such a serious crime must be met with an equally weighty punishment. If the kuffaar do not give people the freedom to cross a red light, how can we give freedom to people to leave Islaam and disbelieve in Allaah when they want to? It seems that the intention of the teacher mentioned in the question was to shock the students with news of this ruling, in order to mislead them from the way of Allaah.

This is the case if one’s relatives are righteous, but if they are kaafirs or are wrongdoers, then cutting off ties with them for the sake of Allaah is how one maintains the tie, on the condition that one tries to warn them, and tells them that the reason for cutting the ties is because of their deviation from the truth.

      "Contents Related Benefits of converting to Islam How to convert to Islam You are always welcome Praise be to Allah.Benefits of converting to Islam It brought us great joy to hear from the noble inquirer expressing interest in accepting Islam. Islam is indeed the religion that links the human being to his Lord directly via the belief in the oneness of God and through various acts of worship. Alsoو Islam instills peace of mind and an inner serenity to the created human being, embodied in a unique relationship and devout tranquillity, encompassing love for, fear of, hope from, and submission to God Almighty, Allah. Indeed, this essence is the true meaning of worship, which comprises and combines acts of the heart with acts of the tongue in remembering God, in addition to the acts of the physical organs. This is manifested through prayer, fasting, paying zakah (the poor due), and reading the Noble Quran, among other acts, which you will find resulting in positive and benevolent effects in yourself, God willing (in sha Allah). No doubt that if you decide to accept Islam that the conclusion which you will have reached was due to two things: (1) a sound mind and (2) success granted from God (Allah). How to convert to Islam As for converting to Islam, it is a very simple and easy thing, consisting of your pronouncing the two testimonies of faith.

In answer to this question, it is sufficient to quote one aayah and one hadeeth. The aayah is (interpretation of the meaning): \"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.\" [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85] The hadeeth is: \"By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, there is no-one of this ummah, Jew or Christian, who hears of me then dies without believing in that with which I have been sent, but he will be one of the people of Hell.\" (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, in al-Saheeh, 153).\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.All Praises are Due to Allah The act that your friend committed is a great sin and crime. He must repent to Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"the eyes fornicate, the hands fornicate, the legs commit fornication, and the private parts commit fornication\". (It is reported by Ahmad and it is in sahih Al Jahni 4150.) Tell your friend that he has to increase in good deeds so that Allah will wipe out his evil deeds, as Abdullah ibn Masud reported. He said that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, Oh Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), I met a woman in the garden so I pulled her close, fondled her, kissed her, and did everything with except have intercourse. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was then silent and so the verse came down, \"verily, the good deeds erase the bad deeds, that is admonition to those who remember.\" So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called him and recited it to him. So Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, Oh Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is this for him specifically or for everyone. He said (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) , no, for everyone.' (It was narrated by Ahmad.) There are more details on repenting from fornication. Refer to question #624. As for your question regarding whether he is considered to have committed fornication, which is punishable by stoning, it is obligatory that the married fornicator be stoned and the unmarried fornicator receive lashes. This is only if the sexual organs of the fornicator penetrate the vagina of the woman. Whatever is similar deserves a different punishment, depending on the level of the haram committed. It is not obligatory that he admit to a judge what he did. It is sufficient that repentance take place between him and Allah, and Allah is the Acceptor of repentance and the Most Merciful. We ask Allah to forgive us and the rest of the Muslims. Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.According to Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, the basic principle is that the issue of who will go to Paradise and who will go to Hell is the matter of ‘aqeedah based on what is said in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and there is no room for reasoning or ijtihaad in this matter. If the Qur’aan or Sunnah says that a specific person will be in Paradise or Hell, we bear witness to that. At the same time we hope that those who do good will go to Paradise and fear that those who do bad will go to Hell, but Allaah knows best how people will end up. The issue of saying who will go to Paradise or Hell may be divided into two categories: General statements, which have to do with people’s qualities, such as saying, “Whoever associates anything with Allaah in an act of major shirk is a kaafir who is beyond the pale of Islam, and will be in Hell.” Similarly we say that whoever fasts Ramadaan out of faith and in the hope of receiving reward will be forgiven his previous and future sins, and that an acceptable Hajj has no other reward but Paradise. There are many such statements in the Qur’aan and saheeh Sunnah. If a person asks, “Will the one who calls on anything other than Allaah and seeks the help of anyone but Allaah be in Paradise or Hell?” we would say that he is a kaafir who will be in Hell, if he is shown clear evidence that he is wrong but he stills persists and dies believing that. If it were said, Whoever does Hajj then does not commit any obscene or immoral act, and dies after his Hajj, for example, what will his fate be? We would say that he is in Paradise. Or the person whose last words in this life are Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah will be in Paradise, and so on. All of this has to do with people’s qualities and does not apply to any specific, named person. Specific statements referring to people by name, stating that a particular person will be in Paradise or in Hell. This is not permissible except in cases where Allaah or His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have informed us of it. Whoever Allaah or His Messenger have mentioned by name and stated that they will be in Paradise are definitely among the people of Paradise, such as the ten who were given the good news of Paradise (al-‘asharah al-mubashsharah), foremost among whom are the four Khulafa’, Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Ali, may Allaah be pleased with them. Those who the Qur’aan and Sunnah mention by name and state that they will be in Hell are definitely among the people of Hell, such as Abu Lahab and his wife, Abu Taalib, ‘Amr ibn Lahiy, and others. We ask Allaah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and Mercy. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We have to make a distinction here between the two issues: reading Yaa-Seen for one who is dying, and reading it for one who has died. With regard to reading Yaa-Seen for one who is dying, this practice has been reported from some of the Sahaabah. Imaam Ahmad reported in his Musnad from Safwaan: “My shaykhs told me that they were with Ghudayf ibn al-Haarith al-Thumaani when he was dying. He said: ‘Can any of you read Yaa-Seen?’ So Saalih ibn Shurayh al-Sakooni recited it, and when he reached the fortieth aayah, Ghudayf passed away. My shaykhs used to say that when it is recited in the presence of one who is dying, it eases the pain of death.” That was the opinion of Safwaan. ‘Eesaa ibn al-Mu’tamir read it for Ibn Mab’ad (when the latter was dying). (al-Musnad, 16355) Al-Albaani said in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel, 3/152: “This is a saheeh sanad going back to Ghudayf ibn al-Haarith, may Allaah be pleased with him. Its men are thiqaat apart from ‘the shaykhs’ who are not named and are therefore unknown (majhool). But the fact that they are unknown is compensated for by their large number, especially since they are of the generation of the Taabi’een…” Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti’ fi Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz: “Soorat Yaa-Seen may be recited over him (i.e., the one who is dying) for the one who thinks that the hadeeth is correct.” He explained that this is because this soorah contains good news of Paradise, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “It was said: ‘Enter Paradise.’…” [Yaa-Seen 36:26], and because it makes the passage of the soul easier, and other reasons. As regards reading Soorat Yaa-Seen for one who has died, there is no saheeh hadeeth to indicate that this should be done. A hadeeth was narrated by Abu Dawood and others which says “Read Yaa-Seen over your dead”, but this hadeeth is not saheeh because its isnaad contains contradictions and narrators who are unknown (majhool). This was stated by al-‘Allaamah al-Albaani in Irwaa’ al-Ghaleel, hadeeth no. 688. Reading Qur’aan over the dead is considered to be bid’ah (innovation), as he states at the end of his book Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz. Some people think that it should be read forty times over the deceased, and some of them may distribute copies of the Qur’aan among the mourners who gather to offer condolences so that they may read, or organize gatherings in the mosque to read it for the soul of the deceased. All of this has no basis whatsoever (in the sunnah), and these are innovated deeds of bid’ah which we should avoid and warn others against. And Allaah is the Source of strength.\n",

Thirdly, the children who were born to this woman outside of marriage are not your children; they cannot take your name and must take her name. However, this should not prevent you from treating them kindly, taking care of them and spending on them. In the future, you should try to call them and their mother to Islaam. Fourthly, going to her church and attending rituals of kufr is not advisable, because of the possible negative consequences. We advise you not to do that, but this should not be any obstacle to your entering Islam. If you were to say that it is a choice of either embracing Islam and going to the church with her, or not embracing Islam at all, we would definitely tell you to embrace Islam. But we would like you to think of the meaning of these two soorahs of the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meanings): \"Say: He is Allaah, (the) One.

He begets not nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.\"[al-Ikhlaas 112:1-4] \"Say: O Kaafiroon (disbelievers in Allaah, in His Oneness, etc.)!

It was narrated from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that a loan is like an act of charity. If the bank lends you one million riyaals for a period of one year, and after that year passes you return the million that you borrowed and add another million for them to keep for a year in return for their loan to you, this is haraam according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every loan which brings benefits is ribaa.” (this version narrated by al-Baghawi). The bank lent you one million riyaals on the condition that you give them one million more than what is due to them, so that they can buy and sell with it and keep the profits for themselves. This condition brings benefits, so it is an invalid condition according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. All that you have to do is to give the bank the million that you borrowed from them, and not another million to benefit from for a year. This is not permissible according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. The bank is not entitled to anything except getting its money back, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messengerbut if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums).” [al-Baqarah 2:278-289]\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Even though we find it strange that a Muslim would ask such a question about matters which are so clear and undisputed, the answer is simply that these things are haraam because Allaah, Whom we must obey, has forbidden them. He tells us in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meanings): “And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah (a great sin) and an evil way.” [al-Israa’ 17:32] “He has forbidden you only the maytatah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine…” [al-Baqarah 2:173] “O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansaab [stone altars for sacrifice to false gods], and al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from al-salaah. So, will you not then abstain?” [al-Maa’idah 5:90-91] So we must avoid all that which Allaah has forbidden, out of faith in His laws, in the hope of His reward and in fear of His punishment. We must also believe that Allaah does not forbid anything in Islamic sharee’ah except that which is harmful and corrupt, whether we understand this rationally or not, because He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:65]\n",

If any one of you sneezes and praises Allaah, it is a duty on every Muslim who hears him to say Yarhamak Allaah (May Allaah have mercy on you). As for yawning, it is from Shaytaan, so if any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can, for if any of you yawns, the Shaytaan laughs at him.\" (al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 6226) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Yawning is from Shaytaan, so if any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can.\" (Muslim, 2994) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Sneezing is from Allaah and yawning is from Shaytaan. If any of you yawns, let him place his hand over his mouth. If he says Ah, ah! (makes a noise when yawning), Shaytaan laughs from inside him.\" Abu Eesaa said: this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 2746; classified as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 4130) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allah loves sneezing and dislikes yawning. If any one of you sneezes and says Al-hamdu Lillaah, it is a duty on everyone who hears him to say Yarhamak Allaah. As for yawning, if any one of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can, and do not say Hah, hah (do not make a noise when yawning), for this is from Shaytaan and he laughs at it.\" Abu Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hadeeth. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2747) Abu Saeed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"If any of you yawns, let him cover his mouth lest the Shaytaan enter.\" (Abu Dawud) Abu Saeed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"If any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as possible, lest the Shaytaan enter his mouth.\" (Imaam Ahmad) According to another report also narrated by Imaam Ahmad, Shaytaan enters when a person yawns. (Saheeh al-Jaami, 426) From the reports quoted above, we may summarize the following: 1. That Shaytaan prompts the human to yawn, which is indicative of laziness and sluggishness. 2. That Shaytaan enters the person who yawns. 3. That Shaytaan laughs at man and makes fun of his ugly appearance when he is in that state. The person who is praying must take care of the following: 1. He should resist yawning. 2. He should cover his mouth 3. He should suppress his voice (not make a sound). And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The fact that you have concern with the blessed month of Ramadhan, are questioning it's arrival, and anticipating it, is very wonderful. It indicates that you are affected by this great Islamic worship, which consists of abstaining from food and drink, and sexual intercourse from fajr (the break of dawn), until maghrib ( the sunset) during the day of the noble month of Ramadhan. As far as it's appointed time, my dear respected questioner, the laws of worship in Islam are scheduled according to proof which is clearly traceable and detectable. The evidence which is seen is not estimated. This entails the sighting of the moon, which indicates that the month of Ramadhan has begun. So, if we see the new moon, or it is established that someone amongst us has seen the new moon, then it becomes obligatory on the entire Muslim community to fast every day of this month, until we see the new moon for the following month of Shawwal and know that therefore Ramadhan has ended. The month of Ramadhan on the Islamic calendar could be 29 or 30 days depending on the sighting of the physical proof, which is the new moon. According to the Christian calender, the approximate time of Ramadhan this year would occur on the 30th or 31st of December 1997. In order for your fast to be correct and accepted, you must first enter Islam by testifying to Allah's Oneness and believing in the Prophet and following the laws of Islam. We would be happy to see you living a happy life with strong faith, and good years to come, spending them inspired by Islam. We ask Allah to protect you and guide you along.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. To the noble inquirer: You have traversed an important part of the path to the truth and directing yourself towards it. From what I have been able to gather from your question, I understand that you wish to embrace Islam but what is preventing you from doing so is fear for your sick mother's health upon hearing the news. I want you to know that overcoming this obstacle is an easy matter, as it is possible for you in a practical way, to conceal your acceptance of Islam and not divulge it. You are not required to announce your acceptance of Islam in an Islamic center or anywhere else; all that is required is the pronouncing of the two testimonies of faith (see question(s) ) and the initiation of practicing the rites of the religion. You can pray in private, undisclosed places, for example. In addition, fasting will not be difficult as you can easily advance any appropriate excuse for not eating if something is offered to you during the daylight hours of the month of fasting. Now, I would like to remind you of two things: Firstly, that the driving factor and underlying truth regarding wanting to embrace the religion must be to gain the pleasure and acceptance of your Lord--Allaah, the Most Glorified and All-High, who does not accept any religion other than Islam, as He has said in his Glorious Book (the Qur'aan), [interpretation of the meaning]: \"And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam--it will never be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.\" (The Family of Imran, verse 3:85) It has been narrated by Abu Hurairah, may Allaah be please with him, that Allaah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: \"By Him in whose hand Muhammad's soul is (i.e., God, Allaah), there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these present nations to whom I have been sent) who hears about me and then dies without believing in the message with which I have been sent (i.e. Islamic monotheism), but he will be among the dwellers of the Hellfire.\" (Sahih Muslim, Book of Faith, #240). Thus, your objectives in entering Islam are to save yourself from being among the permanent dwellers of Hell in the Hereafter, and to achieve the fantastic reward of the bliss of Heaven, the vastness of which is greater than that of the earth and the skies. Your overriding motive for accepting Islam should not be emotions stemming from your relationship with the Muslim man with whom you are in love. Your embracing Islam is something necessary for yourself whether you marry this man or not. Secondly, obeying God (Allaah) and His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has a higher priority than your closest relative and most beloved dear one even if it is your mother or your spouse or anyone else. The Prophet of guidance has said : \"There are three qualities, for which whoever is characterized by them will relish the sweetness of faith: one to whom Allaah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; one who loves a man only for Allaah's sake; and one who abhors returning to apostasy after Allaah has rescued him from it as he abhors being cast into Hell.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book of Faith, #15). He also said: \"No worshipper (and in the hadeeth narrated by 'Abdul-Warith, no person) is a truthful believer, until I am dearer to him than the members of his household, his wealth and the whole of mankind.\" (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book of Faith #14). I ask Allaah to hasten you to Islam and to help you firmly establish yourself in it, and to grant you a righteous and successful marriage as well as a blessed family. Indeed, Allaah is the One who guides to the path of truth, success, and righteousness. Please see Subject area :Issues Relevant to New Muslims and Accepting Islam.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. What your friend has told you is true. Many ahaadeeth were reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which forbid isbaal (wearing ones clothes below the ankles), for example: Al-Bukhaari reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whatever of the izaar (lower garment) is below the ankles is in the Fire.\" (al-Bukhaari, no. 5787) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"There are three whom Allaah will not look at or praise on the Day of Judgement and theirs will be a painful punishment: the one who wears his garment below his ankles, the one who reminds others of his favours, and the one who sells his product by means of making false oaths\" (reported by Muslim, no. 106) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Isbaal (wearing ones garment below the ankles) may apply to the izaar (lower garment), the shirt or the turban. Whoever allows any part of these to trail on the ground out of arrogance, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.\" (reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4085, and al-Nisaai, no. 5334, with a saheeh isnaad). Ibn Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah will not look at the one who wears his lower garment below his ankles.\" (Reported by al-Nisaai in al-Mujtabaa, Kitaab al-Zeenah, Baab Isbaal al-Izaar). Hudhayfah said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took hold of the muscle of my calf (or his calf) and said, This is where the izaar should stop; if you insist, it may be lower, but it should not reach the ankles.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth; see Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 1783) All of the ahaadeeth quoted above speak against isbaal, whether or not the intention is to show off; but if a person does this deliberately out of arrogance, there is no doubt that his sin is greater. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah will not look at the one who trails his izaar on the ground out of pride.\" (al-Bukhaari, no. 5788) Jaabir ibn Sulaym said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: Beware of wearing ones lower garment below the ankles, because this is a kind of showing-off, and Allaah does not love showing-off.\" (Regarded as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2722). No one is able to be completely free of pride and arrogance, even if he claims that this is so. Such a claim is unacceptable, because by saying it, he is praising himself. Only in the case of those whom the wahy (revelation) testified that they were free of pride do we believe that this is the case. For example, there is a hadeeth which states that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.\" Abu Bakr said to him, \"O Messenger of Allaah, my izaar slips down if I do not pay attention to it.\" He said: \"You are not one of those who do it out of pride.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 5784) What indicates that isbaal is prohibited even if it is not done out of pride is the hadeeth of Abu Saeed al-Khudri, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The lower garment of the Muslim should come down to mid-calf, but there is nothing wrong if it is between that point and the ankles. Whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire. Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4093, with a saheeh isnaad.) These ahaadeeth describe two different deeds, for which there will be two different punishments: Imaam Ahmad reported that Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Yaqoob said: \"I asked Abu Saeed: Did you hear anything from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning the izaar (lower garment)? he said, Yes, listen! The izaar of the believer should come to mid-calf, although there is nothing wrong if it comes between there and the ankles, but whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire, and he said it three times.\" Ibn Umar said: \"I passed by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and my izaar had slipped down. He said, O Abdullaah, pull up your izaar! so I pulled it up. He said, More! so I pulled it up more, and always made sure it was pulled up properly after that.\" Some people asked, \"To where did you pull it up?\" He said, \"To mid-calf length.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 2086; al-Dhahabi, Kitaab al-Kabaair, 131-132) The issue of isbaal applies to women just as much as it applies to men. This is indicated by the hadeeth of Ibn Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him. Umm Salamah said: O Messenger of Allaah, what should women do with their hems? He said, Let them go down a handspan. She asked, What if their feet show? He said, Let them lengthen it by a cubit, but no more.\" (al-Nisaa'i, Kitaab al-zeenah, Baab dhuyool al-nisaa). The punishment for showing off may come to pass in this world, not in the Hereafter. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whilst a man was walking arrogantly admiring himself and his clothes, Allaah caused the earth to swallow him and he is suffering in it until the Day of Resurrection.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 2088).\n",

This was a special case, as the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, have stated. (See Al-Ayat al-Bayyinat fi ‘adam Sama’ al-Amwat). Perhaps the psychological motive for wishing that your father could hear you is an attempt to do something to re-establish the communication that has been cut, in order to alleviate the pain you are feeling. What benefits the dead in Islam? You should understand, my sister, that Islam has explained what actions on the part of the living may benefit the dead, and what may reach them in their graves. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"When a person dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: sadaqah jariyah (ongoing charity, e.g. a waqf or endowment), beneficial knowledge (which he has left behind), or a righteous child who will pray for him.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no 1376; he said this is a sahih hasan hadith) The most important thing that will benefit your father after his death, and that you can do for him now that he is in his grave, is to strive to pray for him and ask for forgiveness and mercy for him, and for Paradise and salvation from the Fire, and other good and beautiful du`as (prayers). Prayers for forgiveness offered by both sons and daughters of the deceased bring great benefits, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"A man’s status will be raised in Paradise and he will ask, How did I get here? He will be told, By your son’s du’as (prayers) for forgiveness for you.\" (Reported by Ibn Majah, no 3660; see also Sahih al-Jami, 1617) Another thing that may reach the deceased is sadaqah (charity) given on his behalf, because `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \"My mother has passed away, and if she could have spoken, she would have given something in charity. Will she receive a reward if I give something on her behalf?\" He said, \"Yes.\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 1388) Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the mother of Sa’d ibn Ubadah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) died when he was away from her. He said: \"O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died and I am away from her. Will it benefit her anything if I give in charity on her behalf?\" He said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Then I ask you to be my witness that I am giving my garden al-Mikhraf (so called because it bore so many dates) in charity on her behalf.\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 2756) Abu Hurayrah reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \"My father has died and left money behind. He did not make a wasiyyah (a will); will it expiate for his sins if I give some of it in charity on his behalf?\" He said, \"Yes.\" (Reported by al-Nasai) Sa'd ibn Ubadah said: \"I said: O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died. Should I give charity on her behalf? He said, Yes. I asked, What kind of charity is best? He said, Providing water.\" (Reported by al-Nasai) Other deeds that may also benefit the dead Other deeds that may also benefit the deceased are Hajj and ‘Umrah on their behalf, after the living person has first performed Hajj and ‘Umrah on his or her own behalf. ‘Abdullah ibn Buraydah reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"While I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a woman came to him and said: I gave my mother a slave-woman in charity, and now my mother has died. He said: You have got your reward, and your right of inheritance has brought your gift back to you. She said, O Messenger of Allah, she still had one month to fast. Can I fast it on her behalf? He said, Fast it on her behalf. She said, She never went to Hajj. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf? He said, Perform Hajj on her behalf.\" (Reported by Muslim, may Allah have mercy on him, in his Sahih, no. 1149) This shows that it is also permissible to fast on behalf of the deceased. Another thing that may benefit the deceased is to fulfil their nadhr (vow), because Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that a woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: \"My mother made a vow to perform Hajj but she died before she could do it. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf?\" He said, \"Yes, perform Hajj on her behalf. Don't you think that if your mother owed a debt you would pay it off?\" She said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Then pay off what is owed to Allah, for Allah is more deserving of having vows fulfilled.\" (al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 7315) Another thing that may benefit the deceased is if his relative devotes a share to him of a sacrifice he offers. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered a sacrifice, he said: \"In the name of Allah, O Allah, on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad\" (reported by Muslim, no. 1967) and the family of Muhammad included both the living and the dead. The question of whether women may visit graves has already been addressed (please see question# 127 ) You should also know that keeping yourself busy with praying for your father is more important and better for you, and more beneficial to the deceased, than thinking about whether he can hear your voice. So try to do whatever will be of benefit both to him and you. You and your family should avoid forbidden innovations (bid’ah) such as marking the fortieth day after death, or the passing of one year since the death, or gatherings for reciting al-Fatihah (the first chapter of surah of the Quran), doing forbidden acts at graves, and so on, deeds which are done by those who are ignorant and are imitated by others. I ask Allah to forgive your father and have mercy on him and on all the deceased Muslims, for He is the Forgiving, Most Merciful. For more, please see these answers: 9979 , 43138 , and 9304 .

      "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. The problem lies in that your friend is a kafir (non-believer) who believes in what the archeologists say more than in what Allaah the Most Exalted says. The only solution is that this friend of yours realizes and believes that the One who created Moses, the magicians, the Pharaohs, and the Persians, knows them better, and knows every minute detail in their lives and all the events that occurred to them, than anyone else. And tell this friend of yours, who claims that he has read the story of Moses and the Pharaoh: Doesnt Allah the Most Exalted say in the Quraan, with regards to the dialogue that took place between Moses and the Pharaoh (interpretation of the meaning): Firaun (Pharaoh) said: \" What about the generations of old (previous generations)?

      "Related Praise be to Allah.In this issue, the strongest of the statements of the scholars is that touching the wife does not break the wudu, unless there is a discharge of sperm. This is the statement of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) and it is also from ‘Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) as well as Hasan, Mujahid, and Qatadah. It is also of the madhhab of Abu Hanifah. Ibn Jarir supports this statement, as well as At-Tabari and Sheikh Al-Islam ibn Taimiyyah. The people who support this statement, use as proof the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said, \"I was sleeping in front of the Messenger of Allah and my legs were in his qiblah. When he prostrated he touched me and I withdrew my legs, and when he stood I stretched them out\". (Homes in those days did not have lamps.) (Al-Bukhari,328) They also use the hadith where `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) says, \"I noticed the Messenger of Allah was gone one evening from the bed, so I looked for him and my hand landed on the sole of his feet and he was in the mosque. They were close together and he was saying, \"O Allah I seek refuge with You, pleasure from Your anger, and with Your pardon, and from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from what is falsely attributed to You as praise. You are how You have praised Yourself\". (Muslim, 486) An-Nawawi states in explaining this hadith that `Aisha’s statement, \"and my hand landed on the soles of his feet when he was in the mosque and they were close together,\" is proof for the one who says that touching the wife does not break wudu. Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah says the statement of Allah, \"Or ye have been in contact with women\" refers to sex as Ibn Abbas and others from the Arabs have said. It is reported by ‘Ali and others, and it is the correct meaning of the verse. There is nothing showing that touching one's wife breaks wudu in the Quran or Sunnah. The Muslims used to touch their wives all the time and not one of the Muslims reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered anyone to make wudu because of touching women .

      "Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. The one and only religion that Allaah, the Most Gracious, accepts is Islam. This religion has one path, one direction and is based on one methodologythat which the Prophet of Islam Muhammad (peace be upon him) followed along with his comrades. This religion which Allaah has chosen for mankind is not subdivided into different sects nor does it divert into different paths. However, a number of people have gone astray and corrupted the religion, forming many different groups that bear no relation to Islam, examples of which are Al-Baatiniya,, Al-Qadyaninya, and the Bahaa’iya, among which Allaah the Most Exalted and Glorious has warned us in the Holy Qur’aan: \" And verily this (i.e. Allah’s commandments mentioned in the previous two verses 151 and 152) is my straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al- Muttaqoon ( the pious-see V2:2) \" Verse # 153, Surat Al An’aam. As for the second part of the question, the noble inquirer must know that Islam came down from the heavens in the form of divine revelations and inspirations to the Prophet (peace be upon him). Islam is the religion that Allaah has accepted for his worshippers, and has chosen it to mark the final completion of all that preceded it and thus supercede and be the seal for all religions. Therefore, it is not possible to say that Islam was influenced by other religions (as it was revealed by God, Allaah, the Almighty). We hope that you will read more about this religion and we ask Allaah to guide you to the True Path.\n",

If you want to deal with him on the basis of justice, then it is permissible for you to respond in like to his unkind words, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And if you punish (your enemy), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted\" [al-Nahl 16:126]. But if you bear it with patience, that will be better for you, as Allaah says at the end of the same aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \" But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for al-saabireen (the patient ones).\" [al-Nahl 16:126] If you want to turn enmity into love, then treat him well, if he treats you badly, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily! He between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.\" [Fussilat 41:34] The words, \"The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal\" mean that there is a huge difference between the two. \"Repel (the evil) with one which is better,\" means that when someone treats you badly, answer back with something better, as 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"There is no better punishment for the person who sinned by being bad to you, than your obeying Allaah by being good to him in return.\" (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: \"O Messenger of Allaah, I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off; I treat them well, but they treat me badly; I try to be kind to them, but they are cruel to me.\" He said: \"If you are as you say, it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. You will continue to have support from Allaah against them so long as you continue doing that.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 2558) Our advice to you, our sister, is to be tolerant and forgiving. Follow your mother's advice. It is clear from your question that this man has room to regret and retract his bad actions. Allaah tells us (interpetation of the meaning): \" whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allaah\" [al-Shoora 42:40] However, all of this does not prevent us from protecting ourselves from the evil and harm that such relatives may cause. If going to their houses, for example, will cause some kind of offence or harm, then the relationship can be limited to telephone calls, kind words, the occasional gift and so on. The relationship can be maintained at a distance, if being too close will cause problems. We ask Allaah to guide us all, to help us not to bear any grudges towards anyone, and to treat one another properly. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. (All praise be to God Almighty, Allaah.) To the dear noble inquirer: You have reached the doorstep of entering into Islam and are hesitant due to concern over what you may face vis-à-vis the response of fellow Muslims regarding the dog you use to guide you to the masjid or Islamic center. Let me assure you that the matter is simple and much easier to deal with than you may think. You are a man for whom Allaah has ordained blindness as a trial, and there is little or no practical recourse for your daily movement, coming and going, other than a trained guide dog. Whereas keeping a dog without due need is censured and objectionable according to Islamic shari’ah (due to its filth and uncleanness), in your case keeping a dog is clearly for an urgent need and not out of custom, tradition, or love for owning the dog itself. So perhaps you have a valid excuse regarding this issue, Allaah willing. I can’t imagine that you would require to enter the mosque or Islamic center with the dog; rather, you most likely would leave him outside and enter for worship, attending a religious gathering, or to learn and ask about matters concerning your religion. As long as the case is as such, the issue is solved and the matter is settled. If you leave the dog at a distance from the entrance to the mosque, then whoever among the Muslim does not welcome you warmly would clearly be committing a mistake. You could also contact the director of the Islamic center or whoever fills such a position, in order to explain to him your situation. I would expect him to assume the responsibility for informing those who administer as well as attend the mosque. If you like, feel free to take this response as a letter to him and ask him to peruse it, and I am confident you will find only goodwill and cordiality, Allaah willing. In closing I would like to welcome you to the religion of Islam and send you a warm salutation and an extraordinary congratulations on your desire to accept the religion. I urge you to hasten in taking the greatest step of your life since your mother gave birth to you, and would like to leave you with glad tidings regarding the disability with which you are afflicted. In fact, you will receive a great reward for your blindness if you accept Islam, as per the saying of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) [translation of the meaning]: \"Verily Allaah has said, ‘If I afflict one of My worshippers with a trial regarding his two dearest ones (i.e., his eyes) and he is patient and perseveres, I will compensate him for them Heaven.’ \" (Hadeeth al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari #5653) We ask Allaah to open your heart to the truth and to assist you in holding fast to it, and Allaah is the One Who Guides to the true path of righteousness.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. For breast-feeding to have the effect of making a child a relative (mahram), two conditions must be met: (1) The number of breast-feedings should be five or more, because of the hadith of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: \"When the Qur’an was first revealed, the number of breast-feedings that would make a child a relative (mahram) was ten, then this was abrogated and replaced with the number of five which is well-known.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1452). (2) This should happen within the first two years of the child’s life, because of the hadith: \"Harmalah ibn Yahya told us that ‘Abdullah ibn Wahb told us that Ibn Lahimah informed us from Abu al-Aswad from ‘Urwah from ‘Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr that the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allah be Upon Him) said: \"There is no breast-feeding except what fills the stomach to bursting point.\" (Reported by Ibn Maajah, no. 1946; see also Saheeh al-Jaami‘, no. 7495). Al-Bukhaari, may Allah have mercy on him, included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled: \"The chapter of the one who says there is no breast-feeding after two years because of the words of Allah ‘. . . two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling . . .’ [al-Baqarah 2:233].\" The definition of rad‘ah (one breast-feed) is that the child should take the breast and drink milk from it, then leave it of his own accord in order to breathe or to change position, and so on. If this is the case, then the rulings concerning breast-feeding will apply, i.e. the child will be considered a relative and marriage will be forbidden, etc. In the case of doubt concerning the number of breast-feedings, Ibn Qudaamah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"If there is some doubt concerning whether breast-feeding took place, or concerning the number of feeds and whether it was enough to make the child a relative (mahram) or not, then there is no proof that the child must be considered a relative, because the general rule of life is that a child does not breast-feed from anyone except his own mother, and one cannot dismiss certainty in favour of doubt. (al-Mughni 11/312). Therefore it is permissible to marry if there is no proof of breast-feeding that would make the individual concerned a relative. I do not want to omit reminding the one who asked this question that we are obliged to adhere to the Sharee‘ah no matter where it leads us, and our desires and emotions should not prevent us from following the truth. The Muslim must remain chaste and avoid all kinds of \"love relationships.\" He must strive to protect himself by marrying in a proper fashion according to Islamic sharee‘ah.\n",

Your question may be answered by the following points: (1) This is the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever changes his religion, kill him.\" (reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3017). (2) The one who has known the religion which Allaah revealed, entered it and practised it, then rejected it, despised it and left it, is a person who does not deserve to live on the earth of Allaah and eat from the provision of Allaah. (3) By leaving Islaam, the apostate opens the way for everyone who wants to leave the faith, thus spreading apostasy and encouraging it. (4) The apostate is not to be killed without warning. Even though his crime is so great, he is given a last chance, a respite of three days in which to repent. If he repents, he will be left alone; if he does not repent, then he will be killed. (5) If the punishment for murder and espionage (also known as high treason) is death, then what should be the punishment for the one who disbelieves in the Lord of mankind and despises and rejects His religion? Is espionage or shedding blood worse than leaving the religion of the Lord of mankind and rejecting it? (6) None of those who bleat about personal freedom and freedom of belief would put up with a neighbour’s child hitting their child or justify this as \"personal freedom,\" so how can they justify leaving the true religion and rejecting the sharee’ah which Allaah revealed to teach mankind about His unity and bring justice and fairness to all?

Drinking at least three sips or more and not drinking the entire drink at once. To praise Allah after finishing the drink. To drink sitting down. The person giving the drink to others should drink last. The person passing out the drinks should start on his right hand side when distributing the drinks.

So the phrase ‘If any of your women are guilty of lewdness’ refers to adultery. ‘Take the evidence of four (reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way’ - the ‘other way’ that Allah made for them was the abrogation of this. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said: ‘This was the ruling until Allah revealed Surat al-Nur, then this punishment was abrogated and replaced with whipping or stoning.’ Something similar was reported from ‘Ikrimah, Sa‘id ibn Jubayr, al-Hasan, ‘Ataa’ al-Khurasani, Abu Saalih, Qutaadah, Zayd ibn Aslam and al-Dahhak, stating that this is abrogated, and this is agreed upon. Imam Ahmad said: ‘Muhammad ibn Ja‘far told us that Sa‘id told us from Qutaadah from al-Hasan from Hattaan ibn ‘Abdullah al-Raqaashi from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit who said: Whenever the wahy (revelation) descended upon the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), it affected him, the stress showed on him and his face would change. Allah sent a revelation to him one day, and when it was over, he said: \" Listen to me, Allah has made another way for them. (When) a married man (commits adultery) with a married woman, and an unmarried man with an unmarried woman, then in the case of married (persons) there is (a punishment) of one hundred lashes and then stoning (to death), and in the case of unmarried persons, (the punishment) is one hundred lashes and exile for one year.\"’ It was reported by Muslim and other narrators of Sunan via Qutaadah from al-Hasan from al-Hattan from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) with the wording: ‘Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those (women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should receive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male committing adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death.’ Al-Tirmidhi said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth.\" Al-Qurtubi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: \"This [confinement] was the first punishment for adultery, at the beginning of Islam. Ibn ‘Abbas and al-Hasan said: Ibn Zayd added: They would not be allowed to marry, until they died, as a punishment for them when they asked to marry someone else. This ruling applied for a while, then the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said, according to the hadeeth narrated by ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit: \"Receive (teaching) from me, receive (teaching) from me. Allah has made another way for those (women). When an unmarried man commits adultery with an unmarried woman, (they should receive) one hundred lashes, and banishment for one year. In the case of a married male committing adultery with a married female, they should receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death.\" Some of the scholars said: the idea of punishment and shame was still there with the lashing, because there is no contradiction, and they are applied to one person. As for confinement, this is abrogated, by the consensus of the scholars. And Allah knows best. To complete the benefit of what has been said, it is appropriate to learn the tafseer of the next aayah in Surat al-Nisaa’: \"If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, leave them alone; for Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful.\" [al-Nisaa’ 4:16] Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer of this aayah: \"‘If two men among you are guilty of lewdness’ means two who commit an immoral act, so they should be punished. Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Sa‘eed ibn Jubayr and others said: i.e., by putting them to public shame and hitting them with shoes. This was the ruling until Allah abrogated it and replaced it with lashing and stoning. ‘Ikrimah, ‘Ataa’, al-Hasan and ‘Abdullah ibn Katheer said: ‘This was revealed concerning a man and a woman who commit adultery. The phrase ‘if they repent and amend’ means if they give up what they were doing and mend their ways. ‘Leave them alone’ means not to keep rebuking them with ugly words after that, because the one who has repented from his sin is like one who never sinned at all. ‘Allah is Oft Returning, Most Merciful’ - it was proven in the two Saheehs: ‘If the slave woman of one of you commits adultery, apply the punishment of lashing, and do not blame her (after that)’ - i.e., do not blame her for what she did after the punishment has been given, because the punishment is an expiation for her deed.’\"\n",

The great size of Angels Description of Angels Angels have wings Beauty of the Angels The Angels do not eat or drink Number of Angels Names of Angels Power of Angels Speed of Angels Duties of Angels Praise be to Allah.Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of belief Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of faith without which there is no faith. Whoever does not believe in any of these pillars is not a believer (mumin). These pillars are belief in: Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and that predestination, both good and bad, comes from Allah. Who are the Angels? Angels are a part of the world of the “Unseen” which we cannot comprehend. Allah has told us about them in many places in the Quran and via His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There follows a number of proven reports concerning the angels, which hopefully will make you realize the greatness of the Creator and the greatness of this religion which has told us so much about them: Of what are the Angels created? They are created from light, as ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The angels are created from light, just as the jinn are created from smokeless fire and mankind is created from what you have been told about.’\" [Muslim]. When were the Angels created? ​​​​​We have no knowledge of precisely when they were created, because there is no text to tell us this. But they were created before mankind for certain, because the Quran says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Behold, your Lord said to the angels: ‘I will create a vicegerent on earth.’\" [2:30] The fact that Allah told them of His intention to create man indicates that they already existed. The great size of Angels Allah says concerning the angels of Hell: \"O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern and severe, who flinch not (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do (precisely) what they are commanded.\" [66:6] The greatest of all the angels is Jibreel, upon whom be peace, who was described in the following report: \"From ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Jibreel in his true form. He had six hundred wings, each of which covered the horizon. There fell from his wings jewels, pearls and rubies, only Allah knows about them.\" It was reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad, and Ibn Katheer said in al-Bidayah that its isnad (chain of narrators) is jayyid (good). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing Jibreel: \"I saw Jibreel descending from heaven, and his great size filled the space between heaven and earth.\" [Muslim]. Among the greatest angels are those who carry the Throne (of Allah), who were described in the following report: \"From Jabir ibn ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: ‘I have been given permission to speak about one of the angels of Allah who carry the Throne. The distance between his ear-lobes and his shoulders is equivalent to a seven-hundred-year journey.’\" [Abu Dawood]. Description of Angels Angels have wings Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Praise be to Allah, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels messengers with wings - two, or three, or four (pairs) adds to Creation as He pleases: for Allah has power over all things.\" [35:1] Beauty of the Angels Allah said, describing Jibreel, upon whom be peace (interpretation of the meaning): \"He [the Prophet] has been taught by one Mighty in Power, Dhoo Mirrah (free from any defect in body and mind), then he rose and became stable.\" [53:5-6] Ibn ‘Abbas said: \"‘Dhoo Mirrah means that he has a beautiful appearance.\" Qutadah said: \"He is tall and beautiful.\" The idea that angels are beautiful is firmly established in all people’s minds, so much so that they liken a beautiful human to an angel, as the women said about Yoosuf: \". . . When they [the women] saw him, they did extol him and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said: ‘Allah preserve us! No mortal is this! This is none other than a noble angel!’\" [12:31] The differences in size and status of the Angels The Angels are not all of one size or status; there are differences between them just as there are differences in virtue. The best of them are those that were present at the battle of Badr, as is stated in the hadeeth narrated by Mu‘adh ibn Rifa‘ah al-Zuraqi from his father, who had been one of the people present at Badr. He said: \"Jibreel came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) and asked, ‘How do you rate the people among you who were present at Badr?’ He said: ‘They are the best of the Muslims,’ or something similar. [Jibreel] said: ‘So it is with the angels who were present at Badr.’\" [al-Bukhaari]. The Angels do not eat or drink This is indicated by the conversation between Ibrahim, the \"friend\" of Allah, and the angels who visited him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then he turned quickly to his household, brought out a fatted calf, and placed it before them. He said, ‘Will you not eat?’ (When they did not eat), he conceived a fear of them. They said: ‘Fear not,’ and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge.\" [51:26-28] Elsewhere, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"But when he [Ibrahim] saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: ‘Fear not: we have been sent against the people of Lut.’\" [11:70] The Angels do not get bored or tired of remembering and worshipping Allah Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever slacken.\" [21:20] \". . . For in the presence of your Lord are those who celebrate His praises by night and by day. And they never become tired (nor feel themselves above it).\" [41:38] Number of Angels The angels are many, and their number is known only to Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing the Much-Frequented House (al-Bayt al-M’amoor) in the seventh heaven: \"Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them.\" [al-Bukhaari]. ‘Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Hell will be brought forth that day by means of seventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand angels.\" [Muslim]. Names of Angels The angels have names, but we know only the names of a few of them. We have to believe in the names reported in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) texts, as a part of general belief in the angels. Among the names of angels that are known to us are: (1) Jibreel and (2) Mikail \"Say: Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allah’s will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings to those who believe - Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and prophets, to Jibreel and Mikail - Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject faith.\" [2:97-98] (3) Israfil From Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, who said: \"I asked ‘Aishah, the Mother of the Believers, about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to start his prayer with when he got up to pray at night (qiyam al-layl). She said: ‘When he got up to pray at night, he would start his prayer (with the words): ‘O Allah, Lord of Jibreel, Mikail and Israfil, Creator of heaven and earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You are the Judge of the matters in which Your slaves differ; guide me with regard to disputed matters of truth by Your permission, for You guide whomever You will to the straight path.’\" [Muslim]. (4) Malik He is the Keeper of Hell, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"They [the people in Hell] will cry: ‘O Malik! Would that your Lord put an end to us!’\" [43:77] (5) Munkar and (6) Nakeer From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, ‘What did you used to say about this man?’ and he says what he used to say: ‘He is the slave and Messenger of Allah: I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allah. They say, ‘We knew beforehand that you used to say this.’ Then his grave will be widened for him to a size of seventy cubits by seventy cubits and it will be illuminated for him. Then they tell him, ‘Sleep.’ He says, ‘Go back to my family and tell them.’ They tell him, ‘Sleep like a bridegroom whom no-one will wake up except his most beloved,’ until Allah raises him up. If (the deceased) was a hypocrite, he says, ‘I heard the people saying something so I said something similar; I do not know.’ They say: ‘We knew beforehand that you used to say this.’ The earth will be told to squeeze him, so he will be crushed until his ribs are interlocked, and he will remain like that until Allah raises him up.’\" [al-Tirmidhi]. (7) Haroot and (8) Maroot Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \". . . and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Haroot and Maroot . . .\" [2:102] \". . . and none can know the forces of your Lord, except He. And this is nothing other than a warning to mankind.\" [74:31] Power of Angels The angels have great powers given to them by Allah, including the following: The ability to take on different forms. Allah has given the angels the ability to take on forms other than their own. Allah sent Jibreel to Maryam in the form of a man, as Allah says: \". . . Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects.\" [19:17] Angels also came to Ibrahim in human form, and he did not know that they were angels until they told him so. Similarly, angels came to Lut in the form of young men with beautiful faces. Jibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) in different forms: sometimes he would appear in the form of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a sahaabee (companion) who was very handsome, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin. The sahaabah (companions) saw him in his human form, as is reported from ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) in the two Saheehs Al-Bukhari and Muslim). (‘Umar) said: \"One day while we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there appeared before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black; no signs of travel were to be seen on him, and none of us knew him. He walked up and sat down by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Resting his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs, he said: ‘O Muhammad, tell me about Islam.’...\" [ Muslim]. Many other ahadeeth (report) refer to the angels taking human forms, such as the hadeeth (report) about the one who killed a hundred, in which it says \". . . there came to them an angel in human form . . .\" and the hadeeth about the blind man, the bald man and the leper. Speed of Angels The greatest speed known to man today is the speed of light; the angels are able to travel much faster than this. Hardly had an enquirer completed a question to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but Jibreel would bring the answer from Allah. Duties of Angels Among the angels is one whose task it was to convey the revelation from Allah to His Messengers; this is al-Rooh al-Ameen, Jibreel, upon whom be peace. Allah says: \"Say: whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allah’s will. . . \" [2:97] \"Which the trustworthy spirit has brought down, Upon your heart, that you may be (one) of the warners.\" [26:193-194] Another is responsible for rain, directing it wherever Allah wishes. This is Mikail, upon whom be peace. He has helpers, who do what he tells them, by the command of his Lord; they direct the winds and clouds, as Allah wills. Another is responsible for blowing the Trumpet, which will be blown by Israfil at the onset of the Hour (the Day of Judgement). Others are responsible for taking people’s souls: these are the Angel of Death and his helpers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Say: ‘the Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will (duly) take your souls, then shall you be brought back to your Lord.’\" [32:11] There is no proof in any saheeh hadeeth (authentic report) that his name is ‘Azrail. Others are responsible for protecting the slave throughout his life, when he stays home and when he travels, when he is asleep and when he is awake. These are the \"angels in succession\" concerning whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day. For each (person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the Command of Allah. Verily! Allah will not change the good condition of a people so long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sin and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allah). But when Allah wills a people’s punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector.\" [13:10-11] Others are responsible for recording the deeds of man, good and bad. These are the \"honourable scribes\" (kiraman katibeen) and are referred to in the ayat/verses (interpretation of the meanings): \". . . and He sends guardians (angels guarding and writing all of one’s good and bad deeds) over you . . .\" [6:61] \"Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes, We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record.\" [43:80] \"(Remember!) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being after he or she has attained the age of puberty), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions). Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).\" [50:17-18] \"But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you, Kiraman (honourable) katibeen - writing down (your deeds).\" [82:10-11] Others are responsible for testing people in the grave. These are Munkar and Nakeer. From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, ‘What did you used to say about this man?’ . . .\" [The hadeeth is quoted in full above] Some of them are the keepers of Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And those who kept their duty to their Lord will be led to Paradise in groups, till, when they reach it, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: Salamun ‘alaikum (peace be upon you!). You have done well, so enter here, to abide therein.\" [39:73] Some of them are the keepers of Hell, the \"guards of Hell\", whose number is nineteen and whose leader is Malik, upon whom be peace. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened. And its keepers will say, ‘Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the verses of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?’ They will say: ‘Yes, but the word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!’\" [39:71] \"Then, let him call upon his council (of helpers), We will call the guards of Hell (to deal with him)!\" [96:17-18] \"And what will make you know exactly what Hell-fire is? It spares not (any sinner), nor does it leave (anything unburnt)! Burning the skins! Over it are nineteen (angels as guardians and keepers of Hell). And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire, and We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers - in order that the People of the Scripture may arrive at a certainty and the believers may increase in faith . . .\" [74:27-31] \"And they will cry: ‘O Malik (Keeper of Hell)! Let your Lord make an end of us.’ He will say: ‘Verily you shall abide forever.’\" [43:77] One of the angels is responsible for the sperm in the womb, as is mentioned in the hadeeth (report) of Ibn Mas‘ood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whose truthfulness is confirmed, said: ‘The way that each of you is created is that he is gathered in his mother’s womb for forty days as a sperm drop, and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot, and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then an angel is sent and he breathes the spirit into (the foetus), and is charged with four commands: to write down his provision, his life-span, his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy. By the One besides Whom there is no other god, one of you may do the deeds of the people of Paradise until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Hell, so he will enter Hell; and one of you may do the deeds of the people of Hell until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Paradise, so he will enter Paradise.\" [al-Bukhaari, Muslim]. Some angels carry the Throne of Allah, as He describes in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): \"Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah) (saying): ‘Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire!’\" [40:7] Some of the angels travel throughout the world, seeking out gatherings of dhikr (remembrance of Allah). Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: ‘Allah, be He blessed and exalted, has angels who travel the highways seeking out the people of dhikr. When they find people remembering Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, they call out to one another, \"Come to what you hunger for!\" and they enfold them with their wings, stretching up to the lowest heaven. Their Lord asks them, and He knows better than them, \"What are My slaves saying?\" They say: \"They are glorifying, magnifying, praising and extolling You.\" He asks, \"Have they seen Me?\" They say, \"No, by Allah, they have not seen You.\" He asks, \"And how would it be if they saw Me?\" They say, \"They would be even more fervent and devoted in their praise and worship.\" He asks, \"What are they asking me for?\" They say, \"They ask You for Paradise.\" He asks, \"And have they seen it?\" They say, \"No, by Allah, O Lord, they have not seen it.\" He asks, \"And how would it be if they saw it?\" They say: \"They would be even more eager for it and they would beseech You even more earnestly.\" He asks, \"And what do they seek My protection from?\" They say, \"From the Fire of Hell.\" He asks, \"Have they seen it?\" They say, \"No, by Allah, they have not seen it.\" He asks, \"And how would it be if they saw it?\" They say: \"They would be even more afraid and anxious to escape it.\" Allah says: \"You are My witnesses that I have forgiven them.\" One of the angels says: \"So-and-so is not really one of them; he came (to the gathering) for some other reason.\" Allah says, \"They were all in the gathering, and one of them will not be excluded (from forgiveness).\"\" [al-Bukhaari]. Some of them are responsible for the mountains. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \"Have you ever faced any day more difficult than the day of Uhud?\" He said: \"I suffered at the hands of your people and the worst that I suffered was what I suffered at their hands on the day of ‘Aqabah. That was when I went to call Ibn ‘Abd Yalayl ibn ‘Abd al-Kalal to Islam, and he did not respond. I left, feeling depressed and hardly knowing where I was going. I did not recover until I found myself in Qarn al-Tha‘alib. I raised my head and saw that I was being shaded by a cloud. I looked, and saw Jibreel in the cloud. He called me and said: ‘Allah has heard what your people said and how they responded to you. He has sent the Angel of the Mountains so that you can tell him to do to them whatever you want.’ The Angel of the Mountains called me and greeted me, then said: ‘O Muhammad, tell me what you want me to do. If you want, I can crush them between two mountains. ’\"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"All I hope for is that Allah will bring forth from their loins people who will worship Allah alone and not associate any partner with Him.\" [al-Buhaari]. Some of them visit the Much Frequented House (al-bayt al-m’amoor). In the lengthy hadeeth describing the Isra and M’iraj (the Night Journey and the Ascent to Heaven), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them.\" There are also angels standing in rows, who never get tired or sit down, and others who bow or prostrate, and never raise their heads, as was reported by Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘I see what you do not see and hear what you do not hear. The heaven makes a noise like groaning, and it has the right to (or it is no surprise), for there is no space in it the width of four fingers, but there is an angel there, placing his forehead in sujood (prostration) to Allah. By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much, you would not enjoy your relationships with women and you would go out in the street praying to Allah.’\" [ al-Tirmidhi] This is a summary of Islamic teachings concerning the noble angels of Allah. We ask Allah to make us believe in them and love them. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

      "Praise be to Allah. This matter is one of the issues that have been raised in the modern age, so we should look at each of the two scholarly opinions on the matter and indicate which one we believe to be more correct. The first opinion is that it is not permissible to repair the hymen at all. The second opinion is more detailed: 1.If the rupture of the hymen was caused by an accident or by an action that is not considered in sharee’ah to be a sin, and was not caused by intercourse within the bounds of legal marriage, then we look at the following issue: If it is deemed most likely that the girl will suffer hardship and unfair accusations because of the customs and traditions of her society, then doing this operation is obligatory. If that is not the case, then it is still better to do the operation. 2.If the rupture was caused by intercourse within the bounds of legal marriage, as in the case of woman who has been divorced, or by zinaa (illicit sexual activity i.e., outside the bounds of marriage) in a case that is well known among the people, then it is haraam to do this operation. 3.If the rupture was caused by zinaa in a case that is not well known among the people, then the doctor has the choice of either repairing it or not repairing it, although it is better to repair it. The points on which the scholars differ The differences between these two opinions are confined to the first and third cases outlined above. With regard to the second case, they are agreed that this operation in haraam in such situations. Evidence (daleel) The evidence for the first view (that it is completely haraam). Firstly: repairing the hymen could lead to mixing of lineages, as a woman could become pregnant from a previous liaison, then she gets marriaed after having her hymen repaired, which then leads to the pregnancy being attributed to her husband, thus mixing halaal with haraam. Secondly: repairing the hymen involves looking at that part of the ‘awrah which is to hidden most. Thirdly: repairing the hymen makes iteasy for young women to commit the sin of zinaa, because they know that they can have the hymen repaired afterwards. Fourthly: there is the matter of good and bad consequences, or pros and cons. If it is possible to achieve the good consequences whilst warding off the bad consequences, then we should do that. If the bad consequences outweigh the good consequences, we should ward off the bad consequences and not worry about the good consequences, as the fuqahaa’ of Islam have stated. If we apply this principle and look at the evil consequences that result from repairing the hymen, we will understand that it is not permissible to do this operation because of the enormity of the evil consequences that result from it. Fifthly: one of the principles of Islamic sharee’ah is that something harmful cannot be removed by something else that is also harmful. One of the implications of this principle is that “it is not permissible for a man to prevent his land from being flooded by diverting the flood waters onto someone else’s land.” By the same token, it is not permissible for a girl and her mother to remove harm from themselves by having the hymen repaired and thus causing harm to the husband. Sixthly: the basic idea of repairing the hymen is not permissible according to sharee’ah because it is a kind of deceit, and deceit is forbidden in Islam. Seventhly: repairing the hymen pavest he way for girls and their families to tell lies about the real reason why the hymen was ruptured, and lying is also forbidden in Islam. Eighthly: repairing the hymen paves the way for doctors to resort to performing abortions for the purposes of concealing sin. Evidence for the second opinion: Firstly: the texts indicate that it is permissible and is encouraged to conceal sins, and repairing the hymen helps to achieve that in cases where this operation is permissible. Secondly: if a woman who is innocent of any immoral action is allowed to have this operation so as to leave no room for suspicion, this will ward off unjustice for her and will achieve the aim prescribed by sharee’ah of thinking well of believing men and women. Thirdly: repairing the hymen has to ward off harm . If a woman was left without having this operation done, and her husband were to notice that, it would cause trouble for her and her family, and if the matter became well known among people, the family may never be able to find marriage partners for their daughters. So they are permitted to ward off harm because they are innocent in this case. Fourthly: the fact that a Muslim doctor may perform this operation in order to conceal the illusionary evidence of has a general educational impact on society, especially where the psychology of young women is concerned. Fifthly: the objection of deception does not exist in cases where we have determined that it is permissible to repair the hymen. Which view is more correct? The view which is more correct- and Allaah knows best – is that which states that it is not permissible to repair the hymen at all. This is for the following reasons: Fisrtly: because the reports quoted as evidence by those who have this view are saheeh. Secondly: with regard to the evidence quoted by those who favour the second view, they may be dealt with as follows: The response to the first : The concealing that is required in Islam is that described in the texts as a concealing of sin, but this aim is not achieved by repairing the hymen. Basically it is haraam because it involves uncovering the ‘awrah and opens the door to evil. The response to the second : Preventing the husband from thinking badly of the woman may be achieved by informing him of the situation before marriage. If he accepts it, this is fine, otherwise Allaah will compensate her with someone better. The response to the third : The evil consequence mentioned cannot be avoided entirely by doing this operation, because there is the possibility that the husband may find out about it, even if that happens by way of someone else telling him. He should be told about it, and if he accepts then the evil consequence is not longer an issue, as is also the case if he decides not to go ahead with the marriage. The response to the fourth : Even though there are some positive aspects to this concealment, there are also negative consequences, such as making it easy for women to commit zinaa. Warding off evil consequences takes priority over gaining benefits. The response to the fifth : We do not accept that there is no deception involved, because this hymen is renewed, it is not the original hymen. If we accept that there is no deception of the husband involved in cases where the hymen was broken as a result of jumping and so on, we cannot be sure that there is no deception in cases where it was broken as a result of an attack on the woman. Secondly: blocking the routes that could lead to harm, as mentioned by those who favour the first opinion, is a very important matter, especially in cases that have to do with the violation of the sanctity of private parts and the evil that can undoubtedly result from permitting the repair of hymens. Thirdly: the basic principle in Islam is that it is haraam to uncover, touch or look at that which is ‘awrah. The excuses mentioned by those who favour the second opinion are not strong enough to let operations to repair the hymen be exempted from this general rule. So we have to adhere to this ruling, and say that it is haraam to do operations to repair the hymen. Fifthly [sic]: the evil consequence of false accusations being made can be dealt with by obtaining a medical certificate after the event to prove the woman’s innocence. This is the best way, and by doing this there is no longer any need to do an operation to repair the hymen. For all of these reasons, it is not permissible for a doctor or a woman to do this kind of surgery, and Allaah knows best. (See Ahkaam al-Jaraahah al-Tibbiyyah wa’l-Athaar al-Mutarattibah ‘alayhaa by Dr. Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti, p. 403) Some contemporary scholars have issued fatwas stating that surgery to repair the hymen is permissible in the case of rape victims and those who have repented (from zinaa), but it not permissible in the case of women who have not repented, because this is helping her to continue committing that sin. By the same token, a woman who has previously had intercourse is not permitted to do this operation because this is helping her to deceive and cheat a future husband, since he will think that she is a virgin when this is not the case. And Allaah knows best\n",

      "Contents Related How to consummate marriage in Islam Is there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast? Music in a wedding ceremony: Haram? Praise be to Allah.How to consummate marriage in Islam When a Muslim wants to consummate his marriage , a number of things are recommended in the sunnah: He should treat his bride kindly and gently, like offering her something to drink and so on, because of the hadith narrated by Asma bint Yazid ibn al-Sakan, who said: “I prepared ‘Aishah as a bride when she married the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I came to him and invited him to see her (uncover her face). So he came and sat beside her, and a large cup of milk was brought to him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drank some, then offered it to her, but she lowered her head and felt shy. I rebuked her and said: ‘Take it from the hand of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).’ So she took it and drank a little, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, ‘Give some to your companion (meaning himself).’” (Reported by Imam Ahmad and deemed sahih by al-Albani) He should place his hand on his bride’s head and pray for her, saying “Bismillah” and asking for barakah (blessing), saying the words reported in the hadith narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you marries a woman or buys a servant, let him say: ‘Allahumma inni as-aluka khayraha wa khayra ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi wa a’udhu bika min sharriha wa min sharri ma jabaltaha ‘alayhi (O Allah, I ask You for her goodness and the goodness which You have created in her, and I seek refuge with You from her evil and the evil which You have created in her).’” Abu Dawud said that Abu Sa’id added: “Then let him take hold of her forelock and pray for blessing from this woman or servant.” (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikah, Bab fi jami’ al-nikah; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jaami’, no. 341) He should pray two rak’ahs with her, leading her in prayer, because this is reported as being the practice of the salaf (early generations). There are two reports concerning this. (i) from Abu Sa’id, the freed slave of Abu Usayd, which states that a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him and told him: “When your wife comes in to you, pray two rak’ahs and ask Allah for the goodness of what has come to you, and seek refuge with Him from its evil.” (ii) from Shaqiq, who said: “A man called Abu Hariz came and said (to ‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud, may Allah be pleased with him): ‘I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me.’ ‘Abdullah said: ‘Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from Shaytan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two rak’ahs behind you.’” (These two reports were narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah; see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani). When he wants to consummate the marriage , he should say the words reported in the hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: “When one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: ‘Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna al-Shaytan wa jannib al-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect whatever You give to us from Shaytan)’ – then if they are given a child, Shaytan will not harm it.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 3271) (For more information, see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani, p. 91) Is there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast? There is no limit to the number of guests one can invite to a wedding feast (walimah), so invite whoever you wish of your relatives, the bride’s relatives, your friends and anyone you have a good reason to invite. Music in a wedding ceremony: Haram? It is not permitted in Islam to do anything that is haram such as having music , letting men and women mix, or letting women dance in front of men, or other things that earn the wrath of Allah. How can the blessing of Allah be exchanged for disobedience and immorality? At weddings , women can do whatever is allowed in Islam, such as singing acceptable songs with good words or entertaining themselves by playing the daff (a certain kind of drum, resembling a tambourine without the rattles) only, so long as no men are present. Who should give the wedding walimah? Providing the wedding feast (walimah) is the husband’s responsibility . The sunnah is to slaughter one sheep or more for the guests, if he is able to, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf, “Give a wedding feast, even if it is only one sheep.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, no. 2048). We ask Allah to bless you and your bride and to grant you a happy marriage. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Al hamdulilah As soon as you have come to know, dear noble inquirer, that Islam is the true religion of righteousness and the straight path, you should hasten to embrace it and begin practicing the Islamically-prescribed obligations, such as the prayer, etc. Your earning to learn about Islam is a wonderful thing for which you should be commended. Your unfortunate complaint regarding the absence of a helpful surrounding and a righteous environment is certainly a valid one and to a degree a problem; however, this obstacle no doubt can be overcome by the will of Allaah. For example there are several pages on the Internet that you can use to gain knowledge and benefit. You can also correspond to the various Islamic organizations and publishing houses to get valuable and informative books about Islam. There may be an Islamic center in your town or in a nearby town that you can go to, even if only once a month, to get to know your fellow Muslim sisters and to get advice from them and work with each other in enjoining righteousness and good deeds. Perhaps you can use the internet as an avenue to find out the addresses of Islamic centers in any particular city or state. If it is possible for you to move to a city where there is a Muslim community or an Islamic center which adheres to true, mainstream Islam (followers of the Sunnah and the united Islamic community), this would be very good. If, in the worst case, may Allaah forbid, lets suppose you don't find even a single Muslim about you, this would not ever prevent you from holding fast to the religion of Islam. In Islam you have an ever-persistent relationship with your Lord; you worship Him and talk to Him and ask Him guidance, support, and aid in adhering to His religion; you feel His company and security by your prayers to Him your seeking refuge in Him--to an extent that will compensate you more than the absence of anybody else, and will allay your loneliness and the inability to meet fellow sisters in faith and religion. Consider the situation of the followers of our beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) who embraced Islam at its inception. They remained alone and estranged among their tribes and people, each one worshipping Allaah from his place until the Prophet migrated to al-Madinah, at which time they migrated with him and supported him in establishing the Islamic state. We ask Allaah for your guidance and for you to reply quickly to the call of Allaah and his Prophet (peace be upon him), and we wish you happiness in this life and the hereafter.\n",

If yellowish or brownish secretions and red blood spots appear regularly before and after your period then they are considered part of your period so long as the total number of days does not exceed 15 days. Consequently, you cannot pray nor fast during this time. Yet if your period actually stops and the secretions appear after 1 or more days after your period has ended then these secretions are not considered part of the menstruation.

      "Praise be to Allah. Firstly, we should know what \"bid'ah\" means according to Islamic teaching. It is defined as: any invented way in religion that is aimed at worshipping or drawing closer to Allaah. This means anything that is not referred to specifically in Sharee'ah, and for which there is no evidence (daleel) in the Qur'aan or Sunnah, and which was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions. At the same time, it is quite obvious that this definition of religious inventions or innovations, which are condemned, does not include worldly inventions [such as cars and washing machines, etc. - Translator]. If your confusion has to do with an apparent contradiction between the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah and the hadeeth narrated by Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, then let us examine these two reports and find out what they mean: Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah al-Bajali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing and is followed by others, will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their reward in any way. Whoever starts a bad thing and is followed by others, will bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their burden in any way.'\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2675. He said, This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth) There is a story behind this hadeeth, which will explain what \"whoever starts a good thing\" means. Imaam Muslim reported this story from Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, who also narrated the hadeeth itself. He said: \"Some people from the Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), wearing woollen garments. He saw that they were in bad shape and in desperate need, so he urged the people to give them charity. They people were very slow to respond, and it could be seen in his face (that he was upset). Then a man of the Ansaar brought a package of silver, then another came, and another and another, and his face was filled with joy. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts a bad thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a burden of sin like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden.'\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1017) Further explanation may be found in a report recorded by al-Nisaa'i, also from Jareer ibn 'Abdullah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: \"We were with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) early one day, when some people who were almost naked (not dressed properly) and barefoot, with their swords by their sides, came to him. Most, if not all of them, were of (the tribe of) Mudar. The Messenger's face changed when he saw how poor they were (i.e., he became upset). He went into (his house), then he came out and ordered Bilaal to give the call to prayer. He led the people in prayer, then he addressed them, saying: 'O people, \"be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both he created many men and women, and fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship)\" [al-Nisaa' 4:1]. \"Fear Allaah, and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow\" [al-Hashr 59:18]. Let a man give charity from his dinars, his dirhams, his clothing, his wheat or his dates - even if it is only half a date.' A man from the Ansaar brought a package which he could hardly carry in his hand, then another and another came, until there were two piles, of food and clothing, and I saw the face of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) beaming with joy. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting in the least from their reward, and whoever starts a bad thing in Islam will have to bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Mujtaba: Kitaab al-Zakaat, Bab al-Tahreed 'ala al-Sadaqah). From the context of the story, it is clear that what is meant by the words \"whoever starts a good thing (sunnah hasanah) in Islam\" means: Whoever revives a part of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or teaches it to others, or commands others to follow it, or acts according to it so that others see him or hear about it and follow his example. This is also indicated by the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: \"A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he urged the people to give him charity. A man said: 'I have such-and-such,' and there was no person left in the gathering who did not give something in charity to him, whether it was a large amount or a little. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts something good, and others follow his lead, will have a complete reward and a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts something bad, and others follow his lead, will bear a complete burden of sin, and a burden like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by Ibn Maaajah in al-Sunan, no. 204) It should be clear from the above, with no room for doubt, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not allowing innovation in matters of deen (religion), nor was he opening the door to what some people call \"bid'ah hasanah,\" for the following reasons: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated repeatedly that: \"Every newly-invented thing is a bid'ah (innovation), every bid'ah is a going astray, and every going astray will be in the Fire.\" (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Sunan, Salaat al-'Eedayn, Baab kayfa al-Khutbah). Reports with the same meaning were narrated via Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ahmad, via al-'Irbaad ibn Saariyah by Abu Dawud and via Ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ibn Maajah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say, when beginning a khutbah (sermon): \" The best of speech is the Book of Allaah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst of things are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a going astray\" (reported by Muslim, no. 867) If every bid'ah is a going astray, how can some people then say that there is such a thing in Islam as \"bid'ah hasanah\"? By Allaah, this is an obvious contradiction of the statement and warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that whoever innovates something new in the deen (religion) will have his deed rejected, and Allaah will not accept it, as is stated in the hadeeth narrated by 'Aa'ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours that is not a part of it will have it rejected.'\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, no. 2697). How can anybody then say that bid'ah is acceptable and it is permitted to follow it? When a person innovates something and adds to the deen something that does not belong to it, he is implying a number of bad things, each worse than the last, for example: That the religion is lacking, that Allaah did not complete and perfect it, and that there is room for improvement. This clearly contradicts the statement in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): \" This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion\" [al-Maa'idah 5:3] That the religion remained imperfect from the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the time when this innovator came along and completed it with his own ideas. That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was \"guilty\" of either of two things: either he was ignorant of this \"good innovation,\" or he knew about it but concealed it, thus letting his ummah down by not conveying it. That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), his Companions and the righteous salaf (early generations) missed out on the reward of this \"good innovation\" - until this innovator came along and earned it for himself, despite the fact that he should say to himself, \"If it was truly good, they would have been the first to do it.\" Opening the door to bid'ah leads to changing the deen (religion) and opens the way for personal whims and opinions, because every innovator implies that what he is introducing is something good, so whose opinion are we supposed to follow, and which of them should we take as a leader? Following bid'ah leads to the cancelling out of sunnah practices and the ways of the salaf. Real life bears witness that whenever a bid'ah is followed, a sunnah practice dies out; the reverse is also true. We ask Allaah to save us from the misguidance of personal whims and from all trials whether they are open or secret. And Allaah knows best.\n",

He said: 'All of them are equal in sin.'\" (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his Saheeh, no. 1598) Commenting on this hadeeth, al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: This is clearly a prohibition of the writing down or witnessing of a contract between the two parties involved in a riba-based deal. It also includes a prohibition of helping others to commit wrong acts. And Allaah knows best. It is inevitable that the employee in a riba-based bank will play a part in riba dealings one way or another, even if he is just a security guard.

The author of ‘Awn al-Ma’bood fi Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood said, commenting on this phrase: “Their veils were likened to crows because of their black colour.” However, it is not a condition of hijaab that the clothes should be black, but it may be better because it is more concealing.

      "Praise be to Allah.Seven of those whom Allaah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His were mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth. It was reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are seven whom Allaah will shade with His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His: the just ruler; a young man who grows up worshipping his Lord; a man whose heart is attached to the mosque; two men who love one another for the sake of Allaah and meet and part on that basis; a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty and says ‘I fear Allaah’; a man who gives in charity and conceals it to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives; and a man who remembers Allaah when he is alone, and his eyes fill up.” (Agreed upon, narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 620; Muslim, no. 1712; and others). This is one of the blessings that Allaah bestows upon His believing slaves. On the great Day when mankind will be suffering distress and hardship,the sun will be brought near to mankind, until the distance between them is equal to the length of the stick used for applying kohl to the eyes [meel= may also mean a “mile”], and all the people will sweat according to their deeds, except for some of the believers, whom Allaah will single out to shade them with His shade, and He will protect them from the sun and from sweating. ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “The sun will be brought near to the earth and the people will sweat. For some people, the sweat will come up to their heels; for some it will come halfway up their shins; for some it will come up to their knees; for some it will come up to their backsides; for some it will come up to their hips; for some it will come up to their shoulders; for some it will come up to their necks; for some it will come up to the middle of their mouths; and some of them will be comepletely covered with their sweat.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, no. 16798) There follows the commentary of Ibn Hajar (may Allaah be pleased with him) on the hadeeth (about the shade of Allaah): “with His shade”. The fact that the shade is connected to Allaah is an expression of honour, for every shade belongs to Him. It was said that this refers to His honour and protection, just as it may be said (in Arabic) that a person is in the shade (or shadow) of the king. And it was said that it refers to the shadow of His Throne, which is more correct “the just ruler” means one who holds the position of khaleefah, and anyone else who is appointed to a position of authority over the Muslims’ affairs, and he fulfils his duties justly. The best definition of “just” is: one who obeys the commands of Allaah and puts everything in its proper place without going to the extreme either of overdoing it or of negligence. The just ruler is mentioned first because his benefits are so far-reaching. “a young man”. Young men are mentioned in particular because they are more likely to feel desire because of their strong motives for following their desires. The fact that a young man adheres to worship despite that is indicative of the strength of his taqwaa (piety). “worshipping his Lord”. In the hadeeth of Salmaan it says that he “spent his youth and his energy in worshipping Allaah.” “attached to the mosque”. The apparent meaning is attachment in the sense of hanging, as if his heart is likened to something that hangs in the mosque – like a lamp, for example – indicating that his heart is so strongly attached to the mosque that even when he leaves the mosque, his heart is still there. Or it could mean attachment in the sense of a deep love. “love one another” means, they shared a kind of love whereby each loved the other in a genuine sense, not just to show off. “and [they] meet and part on that basis” means, this is an ongoing love based on religion, which they do not cut off for any worldly reason, whether they meet in reality or not, until death comes between them. “a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty”. The meaning of “of rank” is, of high birth or a high position; this may refer to lineage or to wealth. The woman is described as having all the qualities which people usually seek, power and wealth, along with beauty. It is very rare to find all three in a woman. The apparent meaning is that she called him to commit immoral actions. “and says ‘I fear Allaah’”. The apparent meaning is that he says this out loud, either to rebuke her for her immoralityor to refuse her call. It may also be that he says it in his heart. “to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives”. What is meant by this is that he conceals his charitable giving , and goes to such an extreme that his left hand, even though it is so close to his right hand and is always with it that even if we imagined that it could understand, it would not know what the right hand is doing because of this utter secrecy. This is a metaphor. “and a man who remembers Allaah” – either in his heart, or by mentioning Him out loud. “when he is alone” – because this is furthest away from showing off. What is meant here is that there are no distractions, so he pays attention to nothing except Allaah. “his eyes fill up (lit. flood)” means, they fill with tears; this is another metaphor. Although men are mentioned in this hadeeth, women are also included in what is described here. Although what is meant by a “just leader” is the position of imaam (khaleefah), women may also be included in this, if they have children and treat them justly. The idea of being attached to the mosque does not apply to women, because a woman’s prayer in her home is better than her prayer in the mosque. Apart from that, women have a share in all of these things; if a man may be called by a woman, then it can be imagined that a woman could be called by a handsome king, for example, and she refuses because she fears Allaah, even though she may have motives to respond. Fath al-Baari, 620. There are others whom Allaah will also shade with His shade – apart from the seven mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above – who are mentioned in other ahaadeeth. Ibn Hajar listed them in Fath al-Baari (620) as follows: “Those who fight (for the sake of Allaah); those who help the mujaahideen; those who defer payment of debt for debtors who are in difficulty, or let them off all or part of the debt; those who help people who are heavily in debt; those who help slaves who have drawn up contracts of manumission; those who have a good attitude; those who walk to the mosque; sincere and honest traders; those who take what is due to them and no more; those who spend for the sake of Allaah; those who sponsor orphans.” We ask Allaah to shade us with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His.\n",

If she is wearing them where others will see her too, then it should not cause any fitnah or temptation. There is also the condition that they should not cause any harm, and there should be no element of cheating or deceiving, such as a woman wearing them when she meets the man who is proposing marriage to her. Also, they should not be extravagantly expensive, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and waste not by extravagance…” [al-An’aam 6:141]. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Qiwaamah (the role of being in charge or head of the household) is one of the things that Allaah has given to men, exclusive of women. What is meant by qiwaamah is that men are entrusted with the task of being responsible for women, to take care of them, to guide them in the best possible way, and to issue commands and prohibitions - just as a ruler takes care of the people under his control. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"...but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [women]...\" [al-Baqarah 2:228] and \"Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means...\" [al-Nisaa’ 4:34] Ibn Katheer said: \"This means that men are in charge of women; they govern them and discipline them if they do wrong.\" Al-‘Allaamah Shaykh al-Shanqeeti said: \"This indicates that men are better than women, because the masculine is honour and perfection, whereas the feminine naturally has something lacking physically. All people are agreed on this, because all peoples give women the best of adornments, which is only to make up for this natural lack...\" Rare cases among women are nothing to go by, because the exception does not change the rule. Some of the reasons why men are given the role of qiwaamah include: 1. Men are more intelligent and have a better ability to distinguish right from wrong. Al-Qurtubi said: \"Men have the advantage of being more wise and more capable of management; for this reason they were given the right of qiwaamah.\" 2. Men’s religion is more complete, because women menstruate and bleed after childbirth, and do not pray or fast at such times - unlike men. 3. Spending money in charity and on one’s family is a duty on men, but not on women. Thus if a man refuses to spend on his wife, she has the right to seek an annulment of the marriage by going to a Qaadi (Sharee’ah judge). In summary, qiwaamah is only for men, as is made clear in the Qur’aan. If a woman spends on her husband, herself and her children, this is an act of kindness on her part, as Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): \"... but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it (the mahr) to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful).\" [al-Nisaa’ 4:4] Qiwaamah is for men in all cases: one can hardly imagine a man asking his wife for permission to go out, for example. And Allaah knows best. For more information on this matter, please refer to: Ibn al-‘Arabi, Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 1/531; Ahkaam al-Jassaas, 2/188; Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 2/169; Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/491; al-Shanqeeti, Adwaa’ al-Bayaan, 1/136-137)\n",

      "Praise be to Allah., It is prohibited to stun the animals by stroking or using electricity for these kinds of stunning hurt the animal and the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) interdicts us from torturing or hurting animals and on the contrary ordered us to be kind and benevolent with them especially at slaughtering. Imam Ahmad narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) passed by a group from Al-Ansar (the supporters) while they were aiming at a pigeon. The Prophet said: \"Don’t make an aim from an alive creature\". Saeed Ibn-Gobair narrated that Ibn-Ommar had passed by some youth from Koraish while they were aiming at a bird and in return for their missed shoots they gave the owner of the bird the arrows. When the youth saw Ibn-Ommar, they ran away so Ibn-Ommar said: \"Who did that? Allah curses the one who did that. The prophet (Peace be upon Him) curses any one who takes an alive creature as an aim\".Narrated by Muslim # 3619 Imam Muslim narrated on the authority of Ibn-Gaber Ibn-Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them, that the Prophet \"forbids us from leaving animals tied without food or drinks until death\" (No. 3620) Also, Imam Muslim narrated that Shadad Ibn-Aws said: \"I have kept in heart two points from our Prophet (Peace be upon Him). Allah orders us to refine every thing we do. When killing enemies, kill properly, and when slaughtering animals slaughter properly. So the one in change of slaughtering must sharpen his blade to comfort his slaughtered animal. There are many other evidences that prove the importance of being kind and benevolent with animals. In short, it is unlawful to stun the animal before slaughtering because stunning hurts the animal and Allah forbids us from doing that except in necessary when the animal is out of control at slaughtering and it is difficult to catch it so it is then lawful to resort to partial stunning to control the animal and in turn it would be lawful to be eaten if it is slaughtered alive. This stunning is permitted only if it doesn’t lead to death of the animal for if that happened it would be unlawful to be eaten as Allah the Almighty said in His Holy Book: \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah, that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a head long fall, or by being gored to death, that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal, unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due from), that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrow: that is impiety.\" (Al-Maidah # 3) And Allah knows best, and Peace & Blessing be upon His Messenger Mohammed and his companions.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Greeting the kuffaar on Christmas and other religious holidays of theirs is haraam, by consensus, as Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah: \"Congratulating the kuffaar on the rituals that belong only to them is haraam by consensus, as is congratulating them on their festivals and fasts by saying ‘A happy festival to you’ or ‘May you enjoy your festival,’ and so on. If the one who says this has been saved from kufr, it is still forbidden. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the cross, or even worse than that. It is as great a sin as congratulating someone for drinking wine, or murdering someone, or having illicit sexual relations, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their religion fall into this error; they do not realize the offensiveness of their actions. Whoever congratulates a person for his disobedience or bid’ah or kufr exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allaah.\" Congratulating the kuffaar on their religious festivals is haraam to the extent described by Ibn al-Qayyim because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of kufr, even if one would not accept those things for oneself. But the Muslim should not aceept the rituals of kufr or congratulate anyone else for them, because Allaah does not accept any of that at all, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \"If you disbelieve, then verily, Allaah is not in need of you, He likes not disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for you. . .\" [al-Zumar 39:7] \". . . This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion . . .\" [al-Maa’idah 5:3] So congratulating them is forbidden, whether they are one’s colleagues at work or otherwise. If they greet us on the occasion of their festivals, we should not respond, because these are not our festivals, and because they are not festivals which are acceptable to Allaah. These festivals are innovations in their religions, and even those which may have been prescribed formerly have been abrogated by the religion of Islaam, with which Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the whole of mankind. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.\" [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85] It is haraam for a Muslim to accept invitations on such occasions, because this is worse than congratulating them as it implies taking part in their celebrations. Similarly, Muslims are forbidden to imitate the kuffaar by having parties on such occasions, or exchanging gifts, or giving out sweets or food, or taking time off work, etc., because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever imitates a people is one of them.\" Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah said in his book Iqtidaa’ al-siraat al-mustaqeem mukhaalifat ashaab al-jaheem: \"Imitating them in some of their festivals implies that one is pleased with their false beliefs and practices, and gives them the hope that they may have the opportunity to humiliate and mislead the weak.\" Whoever does anything of this sort is a sinner, whether he does it out of politeness or to be friendly, or because he is too shy to refuse, or for whatever other reason, because this is hypocrisy in Islaam, and because it makes the kuffaar feel proud of their religion. Allaah is the One Whom we ask to make the Muslims feel proud of their religion, to help them adhere steadfastly to it, and to make them victorious over their enemies, for He is the Strong and Omnipotent.

      "Praise be to Allah.Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding this matter: There are four kinds of love, which we must differentiate between, and those who go astray do so because they do not make this distinction. The first of them is love of Allah, but this alone is not sufficient to save a person from the punishment of Allah and to earn him His reward. The Mushrikeen (idolaters), worshippers of the cross, Jews and others all love Allah. The second is love of that which Allah loves. This is what brings a person into Islam and out of disbelief. The most beloved of people to Allah is the one who is most correct and most devoted in this kind of love. The third kind is love for the sake of Allah, which is one of the essentials of loving that which Allah loves. A person’s love of that which Allah loves cannot be complete until he also loves for the sake of Allah. The fourth is love for something alongside Allah, and this love has to do with shirk (paganism). Everyone who loves things alongside Allah but not for the sake of Allah has taken that thing as a rival to Allah. This is the love of the Mushrikeen (pagan). There remains a fifth kind of love which has nothing to do with our topic; this is the natural love which is a person’s inclination towards that which suits his nature, such as the love of a thirsty person for water or of a hungry person for food, or the love of sleep, or of one’s wife and children. There is nothing wrong with this unless it distracts a person from remembering Allah and keeps him from loving Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): “O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah” [63:9] “Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allah” [24:37] (Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, 1/134) And he said (may Allah have mercy on him): The difference between loving for the sake of Allah and loving something alongside Allah is one of the most important distinctions. Everyone needs to make this distinction and is indeed obliged to do so. Loving for the sake of Allah is a sign of the perfection of faith, but loving something alongside Allah is the essence of shirk (paganism). The difference between them is that a person’s love for the sake of Allah is connected to his love of Allah; if this love becomes strong in his heart, this love dictates that he will love that which Allah loves. If he loves that which his Lord loves and he loves those who are the friends of Allah, this is love for the sake of Allah. So he loves His Messengers, Prophets, angels and close friends because Allah loves them, and he hates those who hate them because Allah hates those people. The sign of the love and hatred for the sake of Allah is that his hatred for the one whom Allah hates will not turn into love merely because that person treats him kindly, does him a service or meets some need he has; and his love for those whom Allah loves will not turn to hatred simply because that person does something that upsets or hurts him, whether it is done by mistake or deliberately, in obedience to Allah or because the person feels that he has a duty to do it for some reason, or because the person is a wrongdoer who may yet give up his wrongdoing and repent. The entire religion revolves around four principles: love and hatred, and stemming from them, action and abstinence. The person whose love and hatred, action and abstinence, are all for the sake of Allah, has perfected his faith so that when he loves, he loves for the sake of Allah, when he hates, he hates for the sake of Allah, when he does something, he does it for the sake of Allah, and when he abstains from something, he abstains for the sake of Allah. To the extent that he is lacking in these four categories, he is lacking in faith and commitment to religion. This is in contrast to the love of things alongside Allah, which is of two types. One is diametrically opposed to the principle of Tawheed (Oneness of Allah) and is shirk; the other is opposed to perfection of sincerity and love towards Allah, but does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam. The first kind is like the love of the Mushrikeen for their idols and gods. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah” [2:165] These Mushrikeen love their idols and gods alongside Allah as they love Allah. This love and devotion is accompanied by fear, hope, worship and supplication. This love is pure Shirk which Allah does not forgive. Faith cannot be perfected unless a person regards these idols as enemies and hates them intensely, and hates the people who worship them, and regards them as enemies and strives against them. This is the message with which Allah sent all His Messengers and revealed all His Books. He created Hell for the people of shirk who love these rivals, and He created Paradise for those who strive against them and take them as enemies for His sake and to earn His Pleasure. Anybody who worships anything from the vicinity of the Throne to the lowest depths of the earth and takes a god and a supporter besides Allah and associates other beings in worship with Him, will be disowned by the object of his worship when he is most in need of it [i.e., on the Day of Judgement]. The second kind is love for the things which Allah has made attractive to people, such as women, children, gold, silver, branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. People love them with a kind of desire, like the love of the hungry person for food and the thirsty person for water. This love is of three kinds. If a person loves them for the sake of Allah and as a means of obeying Allah, he will be rewarded for that; it will be counted as a part of love for the sake of Allah and a means of reaching Him, and he will still find enjoyment in them. This is how the best of creation [i.e. the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] was, to whom women and perfume were made dear in this world, and his love for them helped him to love Allah more and to convey His Message and fulfil His commands. If a person loves them because they suit his nature and his own desires, but he does not give them preference over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, and he gets them because of his natural inclination, then they come under the heading of things which are permissible, and he will not be punished for that, but his love of Allah and for the sake of Allah will be lacking somewhat. If his sole purpose in life is to get these things, and he gives priority to that over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, then he is wronging himself and following his own desires. The first is the love of al-Saabiqoon (those who are foremost in Islam); the second is the love of al-muqtasidoon (those who are average) and the third is the love of al-zaalimoon (the wrongdoers).

      "Contents Related What is ‘Aqeedah? Principles of ‘Aqeedah Praise be to Allah.What is ‘Aqeedah? ‘Aqeedah refers to those matters which are believed in, with certainty and conviction, in one’s heart and soul. They are not tainted with any doubt or uncertainty. The Arabic word ‘aqeedah stems from the root ‘aqada, which conveys meanings of certainty, affirmation, confirmation, etc. In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths (bima ‘aqqadtum al-ayman)…\" [al-Maidah 5:89] The verb paraphrased here as \"deliberate oaths\" is ‘aqqada/ta’qeed, which refers to when one has determination in the heart. It may be said in Arabic, ‘aqada’l-habl (the rope was tied), i.e., it was pulled tight together. The word i’tiqad (belief) is also derived from this root, and has the meaning of tying up and making strong. The phrase a’taqadtu kadhaa (I believe such and such) means: I am convinced of it in my heart; this is a rational conviction. In Islam, ‘aqeedah is the matter of knowledge. The Muslim must believe in his heart and have faith and conviction, with no doubts or misgivings, because Allah has told him about ‘aqeedah in His Book and via His Revelations to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Principles of ‘Aqeedah The principles of ‘aqeedah are those which Allah has commanded us to believe in, as mentioned in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \"The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books and His Messengers. They say, ‘We make no distinction between one and another of His Messengers’ – and they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).’\" [al-Baqarah 2:285] - and as defined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the famous hadeeth which describes how Jibreel came to him and asked him about Islam etc.: \"Iman (faith) is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him on the Last Day, His Messengers, and the Day of Resurrection.\" So in Islam, ‘aqeedah refers to the matters which are known from the Quran and sound ahadeeth, and which the Muslim must believe in his heart, in acknowledgement of the truth of Allaah and His Messenger. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. ‘Aa’ishah and the other Mothers of the Believers are included among the Companions of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), so every text that forbids slandering the Companions refers to ‘Aa’ishah too. Abu Sa‘eed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘Do not slander my Companions, for if one of you were to spend an amount of gold equivalent to the size of Mount Uhud, you would not even come halfway up to their level.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3379). Moreover, the scholars of Sunni Islam are all agreed that whoever condemns ‘Aa’ishah for that of which Allaah has stated she is innocent is a kaafir, because he has rejected Allaah’s statement of her innocence in Soorat al-Noor. Imaam Ibn Hazm quoted a report with an isnad going back to Hishaam ibn ‘Ammaar, who said: \"I heard Maalik ibn Anas say: ‘Whoever curses Abu Bakr should be whipped, and whoever curses ‘Aa’ishah should be killed.’ He was asked, ‘Why do you say that concerning (the one who curses) ‘Aa’ishah?’ He said, ‘Because Allaah says concerning ‘Aa’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers.\" [al-Noor 24:17]’\" Maalik said: \"Whoever accuses her goes against the Qur’aan, and whoever goes against the Qur’aan should be killed.\" Ibn Hazm said: \"This comment of Maalik’s is correct, and it is complete apostasy to reject Allaah’s words that clearly state her innocence.\" Abu Bakr ibn al-‘Arabi said: \"Because the people who slandered ‘Aa’ishah accused a pure and innocent person of immorality, then Allah exonerated her. So everyone who accuses her of that of which Allah has stated she is innocent is rejecting what Allah says, and everyone who rejects what Allah says is a kaafir. This is the opinion of Maalik, and the matter is very clear to those who have insight.\" Al-Qaadi Abu Ya‘laa said: \"Whoever slanders ‘Aa’ishah by accusing her of that of which Allah stated her innocence is a kaafir, without doubt. More than one imam stated this ijmaa‘ (consensus) and gave this ruling.\" Ibn Abi Moosaa said: \"Whoever accuses ‘Aa’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, of that of which Allaah stated she was innocent has left the religion (is no longer a Muslim) and has no right to marry a Muslim woman.\" Ibn Qudaamah said: \"It is a part of the Sunnah to say ‘May Allah be pleased with her’ after mentioning the wives of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), Mothers of the Believers who are pure and innocent of any evil. The best of them are Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid and ‘Aa’ishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, whose innocence was stated by Allah; (they are) the wives of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) in this world and the next. Whoever accuses her of that of which Allah has stated her innocence has rejected the words of Allaah All-Mighty.\" Imam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"‘Aa’ishah’s innocence of that of which she was accused is stated definitively in the Qur’aan. If anyone doubts that (may Allah protect us from such a thing), he becomes a kaafir and an apostate, by the consensus of the Muslims.\" Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"The ummah is agreed that whoever slanders her is a kaafir.\" Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer said, in his Tafseer: \" The scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, all agreed that whoever accuses or slanders her after the revelation of this aayah is a kaafir, because he has rejected the Qur’aan.\" Badr al-Deen al-Zirkashi said: \"Whoever slanders her is a kaafir, because the Qur’aan clearly states her innocence.\" The scholars based their ruling on the one who slanders ‘Aa’ishah on the following evidence: (1) The evidence that is derived from the verses in Soorat al-Noor that clearly state her innocence. So whoever accuses her after Allah has declared her innocent is rejecting the words of Allah, which is kufr beyond any shadow of a doubt. (2) Slandering the family of the Prophet SAWS (peace be upon him) hurts and offends the Prophet himself, and there is no doubt that whatever hurts and offends the Prophet SAWS (peace be upon him) is kufr, by consensus (ijmaa‘). Evidence that the slander of his wife hurt and offended the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) is seen in the hadeeth of the slander (al-ifk) reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, in which ‘Aa’ishah says: \". . . The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) stood up on that day and asked who would go and deal with ‘Abdullaah ibn Ubayy. He was on the minbar, and said: ‘O Muslims, who will deal with a man who I have heard is speaking in an offensive manner about my family? By Allaah, I know nothing but good about my family.’ . . .\" What the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) meant was: who will be kind to me, and excuse me if I go and deal with him myself, and I give him what he deserves because I have heard that he is speaking in an offensive manner about my family. This proves that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was so deeply offended and hurt that he asked people whether they could deal with this person fairly. Imaam al-Qurtubi said, in his Tafseer of the aayah \"Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers.\" [al-Noor 24:17]\": \"This is concerning ‘Aa’ishah . . . because of the hurt and offence that the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) felt with regard to his honour and his family. This is kufr on the part of the one who does it.\" (3) Slandering ‘Aa’ishah implies insulting the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). . . \" [al-Noor 24:26] Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said: \"I.e., Allah would not have made ‘Aa’ishah the wife of the Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) if she had not been good, because he is better than any good person. If she had been bad, she would not have been fit to marry him from a shar‘i point of view, and Allah would never even have decreed it..\" Finally, let us remember that the most beloved of all people to him (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was ‘Aa’ishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, as is proven in the report of ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) put me in charge of an army during the ghazwah (campaign) of al-Salaasil. I came to him and asked him, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, who among the people is most beloved to you?’ He said, ‘Aa’ishah.’ I asked, ‘Who among men?’ He said, ‘Her father.’ I asked, ‘Then who?’ He said, ‘‘Umar,’ then he mentioned a number of others.\" So whoever feels hatred towards the beloved of the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) will deserved to be despised by him on the Day of Resurrection. And Allaah knows best.\n",

It is permissible for a Muslim to donate blood to a non-Muslim, except when that non-Muslim is known to be in a position of fighting the Muslims (either by belonging to a state which is in a state of war with Muslims or by supporting aggression towards them). In such a case it is not permissible to donate blood, because this will help them to fight Muslims. If the Muslim has no way of knowing to whom his blood will go, he should act according to what he thinks is most likely to happen.

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah says in His Holy Book: “. . . Hajj to the House [Ka‘bah] is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence]; and whoever disbelieves, then Allaah stands not in need of any of the ‘Aalameen [mankind and jinn].” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97] The scholars’ discussion of the ability to perform Hajj revolves around the availability of a means of transport and sufficient money for the journey there and back, as well as sufficient funds to cover one’s family’s needs during one’s absence, freedom from debt, good health, security on the way, and - for women - a mahram (blood relative within the prohibited degrees of marriage, or a husband). The issue of your Muslim friend revolves around the question of health, so we will focus on this matter here: With regard to the interpretation of the aayah (verse of the Qur’aan) quoted above, ‘Ikrimah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Sabeel [paraphrased in the phrase ‘those who can afford the expenses’] means health.” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). One of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory is that a person should be free of physical illness and disability that would prevent him from performing Hajj. If a person is suffering from a chronic illness, permanent disability, paralysis (that makes him unable to walk) or is very old and unable to move about, then there is no obligation to perform Hajj. If a person is able to perform Hajj with the help of another, then it becomes a duty to perform Hajj when such help is available. (al-Mawsoo‘ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 17/34). Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “There may be different categories of ability. Sometimes a person may be able to perform Hajj by himself, and sometimes with the help of others, as is stated in the books of Ahkaam (Islamic rulings).” (Tafseer of the aayah previously quoted). Whoever suffers from a permanent disability that prevents him from performing Hajj must appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. If his disability is not permanent, then he should wait until he has recovered, then perform Hajj for himself; he is not permitted to appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. This is the answer to your question, which I hope you will convey to your friend. I do not want to miss this opportunity to thank you for your concern and interest in finding out the Islamic rulings in this situation which has to do with the fifth pillar of Islam. I also wish to encourage and invite you to join us in Islam. Peace be with you.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Praying four rakahs after Jumuah prayer is the opinion of some Madhhabs, and has nothing to do with staying in Makkah or far away, or being in an Islaamic country or not, or whether or not there is a khaleefah. The existence or permission of a khaleefah is not a condition for Friday prayers being obligatory or valid, according to Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 8/187) Having dealt with what you have heard from people who have no knowledge, but who are unfortunately in the position of \"imaams,\" as you said, we move on to the basic issue of offering salaat al-dhuhr after salaat al-jumuah. Our answer to this question is that the truth is the opinion of the scholars, most of whom say that there is no basis in shareeah for offering dhuhr prayer after jumuah prayer if a person has prayed jumuah. The one who misses jumuah or does not attend it because it is not an obligation for him or her, such as women, sick people or travellers, must pray dhuhr. It was never reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any of his Companions prayed dhuhr after praying jumuah. If he had done so, there would be reports to that effect. We ask Allaah to give you and us help and strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad .\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to refer matters to His judgement and to establish Sharee‘ah, and He has forbidden us to rule with anything else, as is clear from a number of aayaat in the Qur’aan, such as the aayaat in Soorat al-Maa’idah (5) which discuss ruling according to what Allaah has revealed, and mention the following topics: The command to rule according to what Allaah has revealed: “And so judge between them by what Allaah has revealed . . .” [aayah 49] Warning against ruling by other than what Allaah has revealed: “. . . and follow not their vain desires . . .” [aayah 49] Warning against compromising on any detail of Sharee‘ah, no matter how small: “. . . but beware of them lest they turn you far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you . . .” [aayah 49] Forbidding seeking the ruling of jaahiliyyah, as is expressed in the rhetorical question “Do they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance?” [aayah 50] The statement that nobody is better than Allaah to judge: “. . . and who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?” [aayah 50] The statement that whoever does not judge according to what Allaah revealed is a kaafir, a zaalim (oppressor or wrongdoer) and a faasiq (sinner), as Allaah says: “. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon.” [aayah 44]; “. . . And whoever does not judge by that which Allaah has revealed, such are the zaalimoon (polytheists and wrongdoers)” [aayah 45]; “. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed (then) such (people) are the faasiqoon (rebellious or disobedient).” [aayah 47]. The statement that it is obligatory for the Muslims to judge according to what Allaah has revealed, even if those who seek their judgement are not Muslim, as Allaah says: “. . . And if you judge, judge with justice between them. . .” [aayah 42] Judging or ruling according to other than what Allaah has revealed is contrary to faith and Tawheed, which are Allaah’s rights. It may be counted as kufr akbar (greater kufr) or kufr asghar (lesser kufr) according to circumstances. Kufr akbar will make a person no longer a Muslim in cases such as the following: If he issues laws and regulations other than those revealed by Allaah, because the right to issue laws belongs to Allaah alone, Who has no partner, and whoever “competes” with Him in a matter which is His alone is a mushrik, because Allaah says: “Or have they partners with Allaah (false gods), who have instituted for them a religion which Allaah has not allowed?” [al-Shooraa 42:21] If the one who rules by other than that which Allaah has revealed denies the right of Allaah and His Prophet to rule, as is mentioned in Ibn ‘Abbaas’s comment on the aayah:“. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon.” [al-Maa’idah 5:44]. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “Whoever rejects what Allaah has revealed is a kaafir.” If he prefers the rule of falsehood to the rule of Allaah, whether this is in absolute terms or just in a few matters. Allaah says: “Do they then seek the judgement of (the Days of) Ignorance? And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith?” [al-Maa’idah 5:50] If he regards the rule of Allaah and the rule of falsehood as equal. Allaah says: “. . . Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship) while you know (that He Alone has the right to be worshipped).” [al-Baqarah 2:22] If he thinks that it is permissible to rule by something that contradicts the rule of Allaah and His Messenger, or he believes that it is not obligatory to rule according to what Allaah has revealed, or that the matter is optional. This is kufr which is contradictory to faith. Allaah revealed: “O Messenger! Let not those who hurry to fall into disbelief grieve you, of such who say: ‘We believe’ with their mouths but their hearts have no faith. And of the Jews are men who listen much and eagerly to lies - listen to others who have not come to you; they say, ‘If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!’ . . .” [al-Maa’idah 5:41]. He says: “Go to Muhammad (peace be upon him), and if he tells you that the ruling is lashes, accept it, but if he commands stoning, ignore what he says. Then Allaah revealed “. . . And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed, such are the kaafiroon (disbelievers)” [al-Maa’idah 5:44]. If he does not rule according to what Allah has revealed out of stubbornness and arrogance, he is a kaafir and has left Islaam, even if he does not deny the rule of Allaah. Stubbornness and arrogance may mean negligence and turning away, as Allaah says: “Have you seen those (hypocrites) who claim that they believe in that which has been sent down to you, and that which was sent down before you, and they wish to go for judgement (in their disputes) to the Taaghoot (false judges, etc.) while they have been ordered to reject them. But Shaytaan wishes to lead them astray. And when it is said to them: ‘Come to what Allaah has sent down and to the Messenger,’ see they hypocrites turn away from you (Muhammad) with aversion.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:60-61] Among the things that may be counted as ruling by other than that which Allaah revealed and kufr akbar is what Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem said about man-made laws and ruling by them: “This is the worst, the most obvious and comprehensive opposition to sharee‘ah and rejection of Allaah’s laws. This is competing with Allaah and His Messenger, contradicting His laws in their preparation, support, structure, ruling and references. The above is a summary of the things that may imply that ruling by other than that which Allah has revealed is a form of shirk akbar (major shirk): (1) Ruling by other than that which Allaah has revealed. (2) Denying the right of Allaah and His Messenger to rule. (3) Preferring the rule of falsehood to the rule of Allaah, whether this is complete or only in a few matters. (4) Regarding the rule of Allaah and the rule of falsehood as equal. (5) Thinking that it is permissible to rule by something that contradicts what Allaah has revealed, or believing that ruling by what Allaah has revealed is not obligatory or is optional. (6) Refusing to rule by what Allaah has revealed. By examining this topic from different angels, it becomes clear that what is counted as kufr akbar is the following: Abolishing sharee‘ah as the law governing a country, as Mustafa Kemal (“Ataturk”) did in Turkey, as he abolished the book Majallah al-Ahkaam al-‘Adliyyah which was based on the Hanafi madhhab, and replaced it with man-made laws. Abolishing sharee‘ah courts. Imposing man-made laws, such as Italian, French, German law, etc., to judge between the people, or mixing these laws and Sharee‘ah, as Genghis Khan did in his book al-Yaasiq, which combined laws from different sources; the ‘ulamaa’ (scholars) ruled that he was a kaafir. Confining the role of sharee‘ah courts to so-called “civil” matters, such as marriage, divorce and inheritance. Setting up non-sharee‘ah courts. Discussing sharee‘ah in parliament and voting on it; this indicates that implementing sharee‘ah is conditional upon a majority vote. Making sharee‘ah a secondary or main source, along with other sources of law. Even when they say that sharee‘ah is the primary source of legislation, this is still kufr akbar, because it means that they are allowing the adoption of laws from other sources too. Stating in the clauses of legislation that reference may be made to international law, or stating in treaties that in the case of dispute, the matter may be referred to such-and-such non-Islamic court. Criticizing sharee‘ah in public or in private, such as saying that it is rigid, incomplete or backward, or suggesting that it is incompatible with our times, or expressing admiration for non-Islamic laws. As regards the question of when ruling by other than what Allaah revealed is kufr asghar, which does not exclude a person from the ummah of Islam: the answer is that this may be the case when a ruler or judge passes judgement according to other than what Allaah revealed out of disobedience or on a whim, or as a favour to someone, or because he was bribed, and so on, although he believes that it is obligatory to judge according to what Allaah has revealed, and that what he has done is a sinful and haraam deed. As regards the one who is governed by a non-Islamic law, if he refers to it out of choice, then he is a kaafir whose kufr akbar means that he has left Islaam. But if he has no choice but to refer to this law, and does so reluctantly, then he is not a kaafir, because if he had been able to resort to sharee‘ah, he would have done so, and he believes that this non-Islamic law is false. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. The causes that make ghusl a must are: 1. The emission of semen, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"What requires water (ghusl) is if you see water (i.e., semen) coming out of you.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 1/269) 2. Contact between the genitals, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"If one part enters the other part (in another report: if one part touches the other part), then ghusl becomes obligatory.\" (Reported by Ahmad and Muslim, no. 526) This ghusl is obligatory whether or not fluid (semen) is released. \"touching\" here refers to the entry of the tip of the penis into the vagina, not mere touching. 3. Menstruation and nifaas (post-natal bleeding), because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \". . . And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allaah has ordained for you. . .\" [al-Baqarah 2:222]; and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Hubaysh, may Allaah be pleased with her: \"When your period starts, stop praying, and when your period ends, perform ghusl then start praying again.\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 309) 4. Death: the dead - apart from a martyr slain in battle - must be washed (ghusl), because when his daughter Zaynab died, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Wash her with water three or five times, or as many times as you see fit\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 1175); and when a man who was in a state of ihraam was killed by his riding-beast, he said: \"Wash him with water and lotus leaves and wrap him in his two garments, but do not embalm him or cover his head, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing the Talbiyah.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, 1186) There are other types of ghusl about which the scholars differed as to whether they are obligatory, such as performing ghusl on Fridays, or whether a person who becomes Muslim needs to perform ghusl upon entering the Faith. There are types of ghusl which are encouraged, such as: ghusl on the two Eids; ghusl after washing a dead body; ghusl before entering the state of ihraam or entering Makkah; ghusl for a woman who is suffering from istihaadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding) before every prayer; ghusl after being unconscious; and ghusl after burying a mushrik. (Tamaam al-Minnah by al-Albaani, p. 120). And Allaah knows best.\n",

The fuqahaa are agreed that it is not permitted to keep a dog unless it is for a purpose, like hunting or guarding property or other uses that are not contrary to the Shareeah. The Prophet (peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for herding, hunting or farming, his reward will decrease by one qiraat every day.\" (Reported by Muslim, 2948) As far as keeping a dog to guard the house is concerned, Ibn Qudaamah said: \"It is not permitted, according to the most sound opinion.\" (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/124) For more information on this matter, please see question #377 . As regards the najaasah (impurity) of the dog, the Shaafii and Hanbali ulamaa say that the whole dog is essentially naajis (impure). Some scholars say that any liquid excreted by the dog is naajis (not the dog itself). The saliva of the dog is extremely naajis, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him throw away whatever was in it and wash it seven times.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 418). Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The way to purify the vessel of any one of you if a dog has licked it is to wash it seven times, the first time with earth.\" (Reported by Muslim, no. 420). We must ensure that Muslims continue to be averse to dogs, even in the midst of what the kuffaar are used to do and what some Muslims have adopted of their habits.

      "Praise be to Allah.What is meant by tawassul and waseelah is four things: the kind of tawassul without which faith cannot be complete, which is seeking to reach Allaah (tawassul) by believing in Him and His Messengers, and obeying Him and His Messenger, This is what is meant in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Do your duty to Allaah and fear Him. Seek the means of approach to Him [al-Maaidah 5:35] This includes seeking to approach Allaah through His Names and Attributes, or by doing acts of obedience and worship by which one seeks to approach Allaah, and so on. Seeking to approach Allaah by asking His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to make dua for one during his lifetime, and the believers asking one another to make duaa for one another. This follows on from the first type and is encouraged. Seeking to approach Allaah by virtue of the status and virtues of some created being, such as saying, O Allaah, I ask You by virtue of Your Prophet and so on. This is allowed by some of the ulama, but this opinion is daeef (weak). The correct view is that it is definitely haraam, because there can be no tawassul in duaa except by virtue of the Names and Attributes of Allaah. Tawassul as it is understood by many of the Muslims of later times, which is calling on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and seeking his help (or seeking the help of the dead and so-called awliya). This is a form of major shirk, because calling on or seeking help from anyone other than Allaah with regard to something that that only Allaah is able to do is a kind of worship, and directing worship to anyone or anything other than Allaah is major shirk.

Briefly, it is permissible for you to marry this woman if you both repent to Allaah. The child should be named after its mother, according to the consensus of the scholars. In response to your second question, it is not permissible at all to offer prayers outside their proper time. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \". . .

      "Contents Related Is a woman's prayer at home better than praying in the mosque? Can women go to mosques? Conditions for the permission for women to go to mosques Praise be to Allah.Is a woman's prayer at home better than praying in the mosque? There is no doubt that a woman’s prayer in her house is better for her than praying in the mosque, as is indicated by the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: \"Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila’l-masjid: Bab al-tashdid fi dhalik. See also Sahih al-Jami‘, no. 7458) Whenever a woman prays in a place that is more private and more hidden, that is better for her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"A woman’s prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila’l-masjid. See also Sahh al-Jami‘, no. 3833). Umm Humayd, the wife of Abu Humayd al-Sa‘idi reported that she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I love to pray with you.\" He said: \"I know that you love to pray with me, but praying in your house is better for you than praying in your courtyard, and praying in your courtyard is better for you than praying in the mosque of your people, and praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than praying in my mosque.\" So she ordered that a prayer-place be built for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she always prayed there until she met Allah (i.e., until she died). (Reported by Imam Ahmad; the men of its isnad are trustworthy) Can women go to mosques? But the fact that praying at home is preferable does not mean that that women are not permitted to go to the mosque, as is clear from the following hadith: From ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar, who said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: ‘Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque if they ask your permission.’\" Bilal ibn ‘Abdullah said, \"By Allah, we will prevent them.\" (Ibn ‘Umar) turned to him and told him off in an unprecedented fashion, saying: \"I tell you what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, and you say ‘By Allah, we will prevent them’!!\" (Reported by Muslim, 667) Conditions for the permission for women to go to mosques But there are conditions attached to the permission for women to go to the mosque , as follows: She should wear complete hijab . She should not go out wearing perfume . She should have the permission of her husband. Her going out should not involve any other kind of prohibited acts, such as being alone in a car with a non-mahram driver. If a woman does something wrong like that, her husband or guardian has the right to stop her; in fact it is his duty to do so. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Some of the scholars said that it is not permitted to translate the khutbah given from the minbar on Friday and the two Eids into foreign (non-Arabic) languages. Their intention (may Allaah have mercy on them) was to maintain and preserve the Arabic language, and to follow the way of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them), which was to give the khutbah in Arabic in the lands of the Persians and others, and to encourage the people to learn Arabic and pay attention to it. Other scholars said that it is permissible to translate khutbahs into other languages if most of the people being addressed do not know Arabic, based on the reason for which Allaah enjoined the khutbah, which is to teach the people about the rulings that Allaah has prescribed for them and to tell them of the sins which are forbidden, to guide them towards good characteristics and to warn them against bad characteristics. Undoubtedly paying attention to the aims and purposes is more important and takes precedence over paying attention to the words used, especially when the audience does not understand Arabic and the khutbah does not have any effect on them and does not motivate them to learn Arabic. (Especially in these times when the Muslims have fallen behind and others have advanced, and the language of the dominant people has become widespread and the language of the defeated is in a weaker position). If the aim of conveying knowledge and Islamic teaching to the people can only be achieved among non-Arabs by translating the khutbahs into their languages, then the view that it is permissible to translate the khutbah into the prevalent language of the audience so that they may understand what is being said takes precedence and should be followed, especially if not translating the khutbahs will lead to conflicts and arguments. Undoubtedly translating the khutbah in such a case becomes essential to serve the people’s interests and avoid mischief. If there are some people in the congregation who do understand Arabic, then the khateeb should combine the two languages, giving the khutbah in Arabic then repeating it in the other language which the other people understand. In this manner he will achieve the two purposes, avoiding mischief and conflict among the people whom he is addressing. There is a great deal of evidence to support that in the pure sharee’ah, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) clear for them.” [Ibraaheem 14:4] And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Zayd ibn Thaabit to learn the language of the Jews so that he might send letters to them in their language and establish proof against them, and so that he might read their letters when they were sent, and explain to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) what they said. And when the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) attacked the Romans and Persians, they did not fight them until they had called them to Islam by means of interpreters. When they conquered the foreign countries they called the people to Allaah in Arabic and commanded the people to learn it. Whoever among them did not know Arabic, they called him in his own language and made him understand what was meant in the language that he did understand. Thus proof was established. Undoubtedly this is the only way, especially at the end of time when Islam is like a stranger and every people is clinging to its own language. There is a very real need for translation now, and the daa’iyah cannot convey his message without it. The khateeb should do that which best suits the interests of the people he is addressing. If the best is to give the khutbah part by part, in Arabic and then translated, then he should do that. If the best is to translate the entire khutbah, after giving the khutbah (in Arabic) or after the prayer, then he should do that. And Allaah knows best.\n",

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Wed them with the permission of their own folk and give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25] In his commentary on this aayah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Muhsanaat [translated as chaste] means that they should be pure, not indulging in zinaa (unlawful sexual conduct), hence they are described as not being musaafihaat, which means promiscuous women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them Ibn Abbaas said: muttakhidhaati akhdaan means lovers. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: It means a (male) friend. Allaah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that situation Now that you know the Islamic ruling on this matter and are sure that what you have done is haraam and sinful, we will now move on to what Allaah says about despising others for their origins. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former; nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former [al-Hujuraat 49:11] Allaah has not created mankind in nations and tribes so that they may be proud and despise one another, but so that they may be distinguished from one another and thus get to know one another. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has taqwa (i.e. is one of the muttaqeen the pious). Verily Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. [al-Hujuraat 49:13] Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his commentary on this aayah: Here Allaah is telling mankind that He created them from one soul, from which He created its mate this refers to Aadam and Hawwa (Adam and Eve) and made them into nations, which are bigger than tribes. Beyond the tribe there are other smaller units and divisions, such as families and clans. An alternative interpretation is that nations refers to the non-Arabs and tribes refers to the Arabs. All people are equal with regard to lineage because of their descent from Aadam and Hawwa, upon whom be peace, but some may be better than others in religious matters, i.e., in obedience to Allaah and in following His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). For this reason, after forbidding envy and scornful attitudes towards others, Allaah pointed out their equality as human beings: O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another i.e., that they may know one another by referring to their tribes. Mujaahid said that this meant by calling a person So-and-so the son of So-and-so, from such-and-such a tribe. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked, Which people are the most honourable? He said: The most honourable in the sight of Allaah are the most pious (those who have most taqwa). They said, That is not what we were asking about. He said: The most honourable of people is Yoosuf the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Friend (khaleel) of Allaah. They said: That is not what we were asking about. He said, Are you asking about which lineage of the Arabs is most honourable? They said, Yes. He said: The best of you at the time of Jaahiliyyah are the best of you in Islam, if they understand properly. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah does not look at your outward appearance or your wealth, He looks at your hearts and your deeds. Further information that is relevant to your question may be found under #1805 and #1114.

      "Praise be to Allah., The people of Sunnah and Jama’ah (adherents to the prophetic way) believe that Allah is exalted above His creation because of the evidence of the Quran, Sunnah (prophetic traditions), consensus of the scholars, common sense and man’s innate instinct (fitrah). (1) The Quran describes the \"exaltedness\" or \"highness\" of Allah in different ways, as His being high and above, and by describing how things come down from Him, and go up to Him, and by stating that He is above heaven. For example (interpretations of the meaning): (Highness): \"… and He is the Most High, the Most Great.\" [2:255] \"Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.\" [87:1] (Above): \"And He is the Irresistible, above His slaves …\" [6:18] \"They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.\" [16:50] (Things coming down from Him): \"He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth … \" [32:5] \"Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran) …\" [15:9] (Things going up to Him): \"… To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it …\" [35:10] \"The angels and the Rooh (Jibreel) ascend to Him …\" [70:4] (Allah is above heaven): \"Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you …?\" [67:16] (2) The Sunnah: Many reports were narrated \"mutawatir\" (i.e. with a large number of narrators at every stage of the isnad/chain, such that it is impossible for them all to have agreed on a lie) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), describing his words and deeds and things of which he approved. For example, he used to say \"Subhana Rabbi al-A’la (Glory be to my Lord Most High)\" in sujood (prostration), and in some ahadeeth (reports) he is reported to have said \"By Allah Who is above the Throne.\" Among his deeds is the gesture of pointing up with his finger, when addressing the people in the greatest gathering, on the Day of ‘Arafah during his Farewell Pilgrimage. He asked the people, \"Have I not conveyed the message?\" and they said, \"Yes!\" He asked again, \"Have I not conveyed the message?\" and they said, \"Yes!\" He asked a third time, “Have I not conveyed the message?\" and they said \"Yes!\" Each time, he said: \"O Allah, bear witness!\" - pointing up to the sky and then at the people. He also used to raise his hands towards heaven when he made du’a (supplication), as reported in many ahadeeth. This is proof via his actions that Allah is exalted and high. An example of an approval of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which indicates that Allah is exalted and high is the hadeeth (report) concerning the young slave girl, to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Where is Allah?\" She said: \"In heaven.\" He asked, \"Who am I?\" She said, \"The Messenger of Allah.\" So he said to her master: \"Set her free, for she is a believer.\" This young girl was uneducated, as many are, and she was a slave, but she knew that her Lord is above heaven. Some misguided people deny that Allah is above heaven, and say, \"He is neither above nor below; neither to the right nor to the left. He is everywhere!\" (3) The consensus of the scholars: The salaf (pious predecessors) agreed that Allah is above heaven, as is reported by scholars such as al-Dhahabi, may Allah have mercy on him, in his book Al-‘Aluw li’l-‘Aliy al-Ghaffar. (4) Common sense: Highness is a quality which is associated in people’s minds with perfection. If this is the case, then it should be attributed to Allah because every absolute perfection should be attributed to Him. (5) The innate instinct of man (fitrah). There should be no dispute that man instinctively knows that Allah is above heaven. Whenever something overwhelming befalls a person, and he turns to Allah for help, he looks towards heaven, not in any other direction. But it is strange that those who deny that Allah is above His creation still raise their hands in supplication to no other direction than towards heaven. Even Pharaoh, the enemy of Allah who disputed with Moosa (peace be upon him) about his Lord, told his minister Haman (interpretation of the meaning): \"O Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, - the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the god of Moosa …\" [40:36-37] He knew in his heart of hearts that Allah is real, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And they belied them (those ayat/signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof …\" [27:14] These are a few of the indications that Allah is above the heavens; this proof comes from the Quran, the Sunnah, the consensus of the scholars, common sense, man’s own instincts and even the words of the non-Muslims. We ask Allah to guide us towards the Truth. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.First: A Muslim must be proud of his religion and not feel ashamed of its rites and rituals being performed in front of others, or of what shari’ah imposes upon him. If he fears that seeing the implementation of a religious practice or ruling may cause the unbelievers to have an aversion to the religion, then he wisely conceals, aiming at presenting Islam gradually and in an appropriate way. This doesn’t mean to be ashamed or weak or feeling disgrace from implementation of some religious rituals. I suspect you fear from their disapproval because of their misunderstanding, inverted senses, and spoiled opinions, ideas, and inclinations. How could the removal of one’s socks and the washing of one’s feet be considered filthy or disgusting, when the fact that is that it effects cleanliness and the removal of sweat and unpleasant odor from the feet? Second: It is not permissible for the person to pass wet hands over the socks unless he put them on in a state of purity. You can find the evidence in the following Hadith narrated by Al-Mughirah Ibn-Shu’bah, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said: \"I was traveling with our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Prophet asked me saying, \"Have you got any water?\" I said, \"Yes\" … and poured out water so that the Prophet washed his face and hands... and his arms then wiped his head. Then I bent over to pull off his khuff (a type of thick sock) but the Prophet said \"Leave them for I put on my khuff in a state of purification\" then he wiped over them. (narrated by Al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari No. # 5353) Ibn Hajar, may Allaah bless him, quoted the following in his explanation of the portion of this Hadith in which the Prophet’s said \"I put them on a state of purification\": Al-Hamidy related in his Musnad that the Prophet was asked whether one could pass wet hands over the khuff, the Prophet answered saying: \"Yes if the person puts them on in a state of purification.\" Ibn Khuzayma said that according to Hadith narrated by Safwan Ibn Assal, \"the Prophet ordered us to wipe over khuff if we put them on in a state of purification, for 3 days during traveling and for one day and night in residency\". Safwan’s hadith, although it is sahih, does not meet the conditions defined by Al-Bukhari. But al-Mughirah’s hadith is in agreement with it in its indication of the stipulation of being in a pure state before putting on the socks. Third: It is in fact easy to solve your problem; all you need to do is perform the complete ablution at home before going to work, washing your feet, then put on your socks. Then, if you want to perform ablution again at work, you can pass your wet fingertips over the back (i.e., top) of each foot. And Allah Knows Best\n",

And We have revealed it by stages.\" [al-Israa 17:106] \"We have not sent down the Quraan unto you [O Muhammad] to cause you distress\" [Ta-Ha 20:2] \"Then High above all be Allaah, the True King. And be not in haste (O Muhammad) with the Quraan before its revelation is completed to you, and say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.\" [Ta-Ha 20:114] \"Ta-Seen [These letters are one of the miracles of the Quraan, and none but Allaah (Alone) knows their meanings]. These are the Verses of the Quraan, and (it is) a Book (that makes things) clear\" [al-Naml 27:1] \"And verily, you (O Muhammad) are receiving the Quraan from the One, All-Wise, All-Knowing.\" [al-Naml 27:6] \"Verily, He Who has given you (O Muhammad) the Quraan will surely bring you back to the Maaad (place of return, either to Makkah or to Pradise after your death) . . .\" [al-Qasas 28:85] \"By the Quraan, full of wisdom\" [Yaa-Seen 36:2] \"And indeed, We have made the Quraan easy to understand and remember, then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)?\" [al-Qamar 54:40] \"That (this) is indeed an honourable recital (the Noble Quraan).\" [al-Waaqiah 56:77] \"Had We sent down this Quraan on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder by the fear of Allah . . .\" [al-Hashr 59:21] \"or a little more; and recite the Quraan (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style.\" [al-Muzzammil 73:4] \"Nay! This is a Glorious Quraan\" [al-Burooj 85:21] Can there be any doubt after reading all these aayaat that it is Allaah - and not Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) or anyone else - Who has given the name \"Quraan\" to the Book which He revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? In Arabic, the word \"Quran\" comes from the word meaning al-qar, which means \"gathering\" and \"putting things together.\" It is so called because it is a collection of all the siwar (plural of surah). It was also suggested that it is so called because it combines the fruits of the previously-revealed books, or because it combines all kinds of knowledge. (See al-Itqaan by al-Suyooti, 1/162-163). Finally, we advise you to check what you read so that you do not get confused by unreliable sources in books and magazines that may cause you to doubt the truth. May Allaah bless you and us with beneficial knowledge and help us to perform righteous deeds.\n",

      "Contents Related Ruling on performing plastic surgery Types of faults that necessitate plastic surgery Plastic surgery: Difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden Haram cosmetic surgical procedures Praise be to Allah.Ruling on performing plastic surgery Your question revolves around the ruling on performing plastic surgery, on which we will give you a brief summary. Doctors who specialize in plastic or cosmetic surgery define it as surgery performed to improve the appearance of part of the body. This may be done by choice, or because it is necessary. Plastic surgery that is considered necessary is that which is done when there is a need for it, when something does not look right, when something is missing, if there is too much or too little of something, or because something has been destroyed or deformed . At the same time, it is regarded as cosmetic surgery because it results in improved appearance. Types of faults that necessitate plastic surgery Faults may be of two types: physical or congenital faults and faults which result from illness. Congenital faults include abnormally turned-out lips , hare-lips, twisted fingers or toes, etc. Faults which result from illness include the scars left by leprosy or other skin diseases, or scars caused by accidents and burns. There is no doubt that such faults and scars cause physical and psychological pain and harm, therefore Islam allows people afflicted with them to remove or reduce them by surgical means. They cause the kind of mental and psychological pain that allows this surgery as an urgent need, where necessity permits something that is ordinarily forbidden. Any cosmetic surgery which comes under this heading of need because of the fact that the reason for the surgery is causing harm is permissible, and is not considered to be changing the creation of Allah. Plastic surgery: Difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden To further understand the difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden, we will quote the words of al-Imam al-Nawawi in his commentary on the hadith: “Allah has cursed the women who make tattoos and the women who have this done, the women who pluck facial(eyebrow) hair and the women who have this done, and women who widen the gap between their own or others teeth for the sake of beauty, changing what Allah has created.” (Sahih Muslim, 3966) Al-Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The woman who tattoos is one who uses a needle or similar implements to prick the skin of the hand, wrist, lips or other part of a woman's body until she draws blood, then she puts dye into the wound. It is haram to do this or have it done by choice. Similarly, plucking or removing hair from the face is also haram, whether one does it or asks someone else to do it for one, unless a woman has a beard or moustache, in which case it is not haram to remove it. Widening the gap between the teeth is done by filing between the incisors. This is done by old women to give the appearance of youth and make the teeth look beautiful, because this attractive gap between the teeth is characteristic of young girls. When a woman gets old, her teeth get big and look ugly, so she may file them to make them look more attractive and give the impression that she is younger. It is haram to do this or have it done by another, because of this hadith, and because it involves changing what Allah has created, and is a form of deception and falsehood. Widening the gap between the teeth is something that is done to make a person look beautiful, which indicates that what is haram is when this is done in the pursuit of beauty, but if it were done as a form of treatment because of some problem or deformity in the teeth, then there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah knows best.” (al-Nawawi, commentary on Sahih Muslim, 13/107) We should point out here that cosmetic surgeons do not distinguish between cases of serious need and other cases. Their concern is to earn money and satisfy their customers. Materialists and proponents of freedom think that man is free and can do whatever he wants with his body, but this is wrong; the body belongs to Allah and He can command whatever He wills concerning it. Allah has told us about the ways in which Iblis (Shaytan) promised to lead people astray, one of which is (interpretation of the meaning): “and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah.” [al-Nisa 4:119] Haram cosmetic surgical procedures There are cosmetic surgical procedures which are haram and are not considered to be excusable; these are seen as tampering with the creation of Allah for the sake of beauty. Examples include: breast enlargement or reduction, and procedures aimed at reversing the signs of ageing, such as face-lifts etc. The Islamic view is that these are not permitted, because there is no urgent need or necessity for them; rather, the aim is to change and tamper with the creation of Allah for reasons of human vanity. This is haram and the one who does it is cursed because it involves two things mentioned in the hadith: pursuit of beauty and changing what Allah has created. Added to this is the fact that these operations are aimed at deceit, and may involve the injection of materials extracted from aborted foetuses. These are very serious crimes. Moreover, many of these operations result in ongoing pain and other side effects, as the specialists themselves say. (See Ahkam al-Jirahah (Rulings on surgery) by Dr. Muhammad Muhammad al-Mukhtar al-Shanqiti). On the basis of the above, we say to you: if the disfigurement that you are dealing with is incidental and is causing you severe embarrassment as well as putting your husband off, for example, and you are not doing this operation for the purpose of making yourself more beautiful, but only to remove or reduce an accidental disfigurement, then there is nothing wrong with doing it, in sha Allah. And Allah knows best.\n",

But if he is a man for whom you fear that he may fall into error, then it is not permissible for you to help him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \". . . Help one another in al-birr and al-taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety), but do not help one another in sin and transgression. . .\" [al-Maaidah 5:2] This is what we have learnt from our shaykh, Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Abdullah ibn Baaz, with whose knowledge Allaah has benefitted us.

      "Praise be to Allah.In my opinion this is not permissible, because dealing with them usually only comes after getting close to them by means of things that they like. This is the action of the practitioner of witchcraft who gets close to the Shaytaan by doing things that he likes, which cancels out all his good deeds. When he mentioned that he uses mercury, this is deceit and taking peoples money under false pretences, and it may come under the heading of gambling and stealing. The shayaateen work by illusions and magic, and it is known that they do not possess any kind of money or currency or goods. If they give anything of that sort to a person, either it is an illusion that is not real, or else it is something that has been stolen from other people. It is not right to deal with them at all. In fact, many of these fraudsters who claim that they can make money are cheats and liars who deceive the people and destroy their wealth and efforts; it is no more than theft.

      "Praise be to Allah.The meaning of the Quranic Verse: \"Forbidden to you (for food) are: ..., and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,...\" (Al-Baqarah, or the heifer, V173) , Ibn Kathir (May Allah have mercy on him) said in explanation of the above Verse: \"..that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,...\" means slaughtered animals on which has been invoked a name other than the name of Allah; such as an idol, an antagonist, an arrow of divination and the like for which Arabs of pre-Islamic periods slaughtered animals. In explanation of Verse 3 of Surat al-Ma’ida, or the table, Ibn Kathir said: \"The Verse: \"..., and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,...\" means that eating of animal food on which, upon slaughtering a name other than Allah is invoked is forbidden because Allah, the Exalted, prescribed that His Great Name be invoked upon slaughtering any of His creatures. It is the unanimous opinion that one is forbidden to select to invoke a name of an idol of any creature upon slaughtering an animal. In explanation of the Verse \"... that which is sacrificed on stone (altars)...\", Mujahid and Ibn Jurayj said: Those were stones (altars) put around the Ka’bah. Ibn Jurayj said: There were 360 stones (altars) at which pre-Islamic Arabs used to slaughter animal ... They would grill meat and put it on these stones.. Allah forbade such act and disallowed eating of such meat even if the name of Allah is invoked on it. Slaughtering of animal at stones (altars) is part of polytheism, which is prohibited by Allah and His Messenger. Comparison should be made to the foregoing to decide the rule for slaughtering of animals on which is invoked other than the name of Allah. All slaughtered animals on which a name other than the name of Allah; such is the name of a prophet, a holy man, an idol, the devil, or an item of worship such as the cross and the like may not be eaten.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We urge you to follow the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to food. It was narrated that al-Miqdaam ibn Ma’diYakrab said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls to give him enough strength. If his desire for food overwhelms him, then let him fill one-third with food, one-third with drink and leave one-third for air.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-At’imah, 3340; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 2704). Hence some of the scholars included this hadeeth under the heading of controlling desires. You should also fast a lot, heeding the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “O young men! Whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, and whoever is not able to do that then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4677). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined fasting . So you must also pay attention to the commands of the Allaah, such as lowering the gaze and keeping away from places where men mix with women. If you have the means to get married then hasten to do so, following the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mentioned above. With regard to the effects that different foods have, we suggest you refer to the books of nutritional experts. And Allaah is the Source of strength.\n",

It is not permitted to accept invitations to birthday celebrations , because this involves supporting and encouraging bid’ah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not allowed…?” [Al-Shura 42:21] “Then We have put you (O Muhammad) on a plain way of (Our) commandment. So follow that, and follow not the desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allah (if He wants to punish you). Verily, the wrongdoers are protectors to one another, but Allah is the Protector of the pious.” [Al-Jathiyah 45:18-19] “Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow not any awliya (protectors, helpers, etc.) besides Him. Little do you remember!” [Al-A’raf 7:3] According to sahih reports, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever does something that is not a part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.” (Reported by Muslim); and “The best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The most evil of things are those which have been newly invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray.” There are many other ahadith that convey the same meaning. Besides being bid’ah and having no basis in shari’ah, these birthday celebrations also involve imitation of the Jews and Christians in their birthday celebrations. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, warning us against following their ways and traditions: “You would follow the ways of those who came before you step by step, to such an extent that if they were to enter a lizard’s hole, you would enter it too.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, (do you mean) the Jews and Christians?” He said, “Who else?” (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim).

Not without authority shall ye be able to pass!\" This challenge from Allaah to all will be on the day of resurrection when all creatures, Jinn and humans, will be assembled and the heavens split apart. Angels will descend from all of heavens and encircle the resurrected. Allah will challenge the people assembled to escape if they can. They will not be able to escape as they will not have the ability or the power to do so with the angels besieging and encircling them from all sides. In explanation of this Verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \"Meaning that you cannot escape Allaahs power and predestination, which are everywhere around you. You cannot escape Allahs power or break away from His authority or ruling on you. On the day of resurrection, wherever you go, you will be surrounded on all sides by seven rows of angels. No one can pass beyond the zones \"without authority\" i.e. an order from Allah. Verse 10 of Surat Al-Qiyamah, or the resurrection, says (interpretation of the meaning): \"(10.)

There is no need to examine the nature of their marriage contract or how it was done, and it is not essential that their contract should have fulfilled the conditions of the Muslim marriage contract, namely the wali (woman’s guardian), witnesses and the format of the proposal and acceptance, and so on. There is no difference of opinion among the Muslims concerning that. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that if a couple become Muslim together at the same time, they remain together on the basis of their (original) marriage contract, so long as there are no ties of blood or via breastfeeding between them. Many people became Muslim at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and their wives also became Muslim, and their marriage contracts were accepted. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not ask them about the conditions of their marriage or how they had got married. This is something that is known via mutawaatir reports and is well established, thus it is certain.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Before answering this question, it will be useful to shed more light on the issue of adoption and giving a child a name or lineage that is not really his. In Islam, adoption (i.e., giving your name to a child who is not yours) is haraam, and is considered to be a major sin because of the wrongdoing and corruption that result from it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allaah\" [al-Ahzaab 33:5]. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever claims knowingly to belong to someone other than his father will be denied Paradise.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, Fath, no. 3982). He also said: \"Whoever claims to belong to someone other than his father, will be cursed by Allaah, the angels and all the people, and Allaah will not accept any deeds or excuses from him on the Day of Resurrection.\" (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his Saheeh, no. 2433). In his commentary on this hadeeth, al-Nawawi said: \"This is clearly stating the emphatic prohibition of claiming to belong to anyone other than one's real father because this involves ingratitude and a denial of the rights of inheritance, as well as cutting family ties and undutifulness to parents.\" (al-Nawawi's statement ends). It also involves not carrying out the rules of inheritance, and ignoring the prohibited degrees of marriage to women [i.e. a man may unknowingly marry someone he is not permitted to, such as a sister, when true origins are concealed by not calling a child after his real father - translator's note], etc. If a man wants to sponsor an orphan, the child must still be named after his father, if his name is known; it is not permissible to attribute this child to himself by giving him his name. If the child's real origins are not known, then he should be given an appropriate name by which he may be known to others, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allaah. But if you know not their father's (names, call them) your brothers in faith \" [al-Ahzaab 33:5] In answer to your question, which has to do with a girl - for example - addressing the one who is sponsoring her and bringing her up as \"Father\" or \"Daddy,\" Shaykh 'Abd al-'Azeez ibn Baaz has issued a fatwa (ruling) stating that this is allowed, because he is acting in the position of a father to her, and we should not be so strict in this matter. Note: If a man is sponsoring a very young girl (less than two years old) he should try to establish the relationship of mahram by letting her breastfeed from his wife, mother or sister, so that she will become his mahram, otherwise he has to make sure that she does not uncover (take off her hijaab) in front of him when she grows up. The exception to this is a step-daughter (his wife's daughter from a previous marriage); she does not have to wear hijaab in front of her mother's husband even if no relationship is established through breastfeeding (al-radaa').\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The free woman who has attained the age of majority is obliged to cover her entire body during prayer, apart from her face and hands, because all of her is ‘awrah. If she prays and any part of her ‘awrah becomes uncovered, such as a shin or foot or all or part of her head, then her prayer is invalid, because the Prophet said: \"Allah will not accept the prayer of a woman who has started to menstruate, except with a khimaar (covering)\" (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Maajah and al-Tirmidhi, with a saheeh isnaad) Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about a woman who prayed wearing a dir’ (chemise or upper garment) and a khimaar (head cover), but no izaar (lower garment). He said: \"The woman is ‘awrah.\" As for the face, the Sunnah is to uncover it during prayer, so long as no non-mahram men are present. According to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered; some scholars allow uncovering the feet but the majority say the opposite. Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was asked about a woman who prayed in a khimaar and qamees (dress or gown). She said, \"There is nothing wrong with it if the dir’ (chemise) covers her feet.\" In any case, it is better to cover the feet, to be on the safe side. As far as the hands are concerned, there is more leeway: there is nothing wrong with either covering them or uncovering them, although some scholars think that it is better to cover them.

Hadith No. 6183 in Sahih al-Jami’.) Anbasah ibn Abi Sufyan quoted Umm Habibah as saying \"Allah’s Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"A house will be built in Heaven for one who prays 12 Rak'at in a day and evening as follows: 4 Rak'at before and 2 after the Zhuhr Prayer, 2 after the Maghrib Prayer, 2 after the ‘Isha Prayer and 2 before the Fajr Prayer.\" (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 380. He said: The Hadith narrated by Anbasah quoting Umm Habibah in this chapter is a hassan and sahih hadith. It is under No. 6362 in Sahih al-Jami’.) The ‘Asr (Late-Afternoon) Prayer has no routine Sunnah (basic recommended voluntary prayer). However, it is mustahab (preferable and recommended) that one prays 4 Rak'at before the ‘Asr Prayer. The 4 Rak'ahs are of less reward and significance in importance of adhering to them compared to the \"sunan al-rawatib\" described above. The 4 Rak'ahs are the ones intended by the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) in saying: \"May Allah have mercy on one who prays 4 rak’at before the ‘Asr Prayer.\" (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi no. 395 and he declared it a hassan and gharib Hadith. Al-Albany rated the Hadith as hassan in Sahih al-Jami’ No. 3493.) All the foregoing 4-Rak'ah voluntary prayers are to be prayed two at a time according to Imam ash-Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad.

      "Praise be to Allah.Everyone must fear Allaah and realize that He is watching them in private and in public. They should know that He can see them and that nothing at all is hidden from Him on the earth or in the heavens. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness). So fear Me, O men of understanding!” [al-Baqarah 2:197] – i.e., O you whose minds are aware and whose hearts are alive, strive to please Allaah by doing that which will bring you benefits in this world and in the Hereafter. Those who are not “men of understanding” are those who waste their efforts and their minds in things that earn the wrath of Allaah. What the questioner has asked about, organizing singing parties and soirees to which singers and actors from all over are invited, to which entrance is free or there is a charge, and attending or watching these events, or taking part in them or supporting them – all of that is haraam and is not permitted, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah without knowledge, and takes it (the path of Allaah, or the Verses of the Qur’aan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire).” [Luqmaan 31:6] Ibn Mas’ood – may Allaah be pleased with him – used to swear that what this referred to was singing, because undoubtedly singing misleads people far away from the path of Allaah by wasting their time. It was reported from Abu ‘Aamir and Ibn Maalik al-Ash’ari (may Allaah be pleased with them) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There will be among my ummah people who will permit illegal sexual activity (zinaa), silk, alcohol and musical instruments…” (narrated by al-Bukhaari). The meaning of the phrase “[they] will permit illegal sexual activity (zinaa), silk, alcohol and musical instruments…” is that these things are basically haraam. The word translated as “there will be” refers to something which will happen in the future. What this means is that there will be people who regard as halaal and allow themselves things that are haraam, such as zinaa, silk and musical instruments. It was reported from Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) in a marfoo’ report: “In this ummah there will be landslides, stones falling from heaven and transformation (of humans into monkeys, etc.). This will happen when alcohol is drunk, when people bring in female singers and play musical instruments.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi). No doubt the things that bring about these punishments are haraam, and are in fact major sins – laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (there is no strength and no power except with Allaah). The earlier scholars, such as Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) stated that musical instruments – such as the ‘ood (lute), tanboor (long-necked stringed instrument similar to a mandolin), shabbaab (reed flute) and rabaab (stringed instrument resembling a fiddle) – are haraam, so the instruments that are known nowadays, which cause far more fitnah (temptation) are even more haraam than those which were known to the earlier scholars. Therefore: it is haraam to organize singing parties such as these. Let those who organize them fear Allaah, and let those who are in positions of authority fear Allaah and not take their children and families to these places. Let them realize that they are sinning by doing so, and tomorrow they will be asked about what they have done. Let them know that they can find relaxation in obeying Allaah and adhering to His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), by fasting, visiting the Haramayn (Makkah and Madeenah), and by striving in jihaad for the sake of Allaah, spreading the religion of Allaah and calling others to Islam, and other kinds of good and righteous deeds. They can also find relaxation in other permissible activities, such as learning to swim, shoot and ride horses, as well as sailing, going to gardens and parks, etc., so long as they observe Islamic etiquette and good manners. May Allaah help us all to do what is good and right, and keep us away from the things that will earn His wrath and painful punishment. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The story of the pollination of the date-palm trees describes how, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) migrated to Madeenah, he saw the people there pollinating the date-palm trees by hand, and he said to them, “If you do not do this, it should still be fine.” So they did not do it, and the crop failed, producing only bad dates. He passed by them and said, “What is wrong with your date-palms?” They said, “You told us such-and-such.” He said, “You know best about the affairs of your world.” (Reported by Muslim, 4358). This report, if it indicates anything, indicates that with regard to worldly matters that have nothing to do with halaal and haraam or right and wrong, but are matters of trial and error, do not come under the mission of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as the conveyor of the Message from His Lord. This hadeeth indicates that these matters are subject to trial and error. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) set us a practical example to encourage us, in worldly matters that have nothing to do with legislation, to do our utmost to find out which way of dealing with them is best, to research and explore these matters, to analyze our findings and observations, and to do other things that would help us to develop and make progress in the fields of agriculture, industry, construction and so on. In matters on which sharee’ah is silent and did not give any specific ruling, we are permitted to act within the general guidelines of Islam, such as the principle of not causing or reciprocating harm, and so on. There is a big difference between this incident and its implications, and the reports in which the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that things were halaal or haraam, or that something would lead to punishment or not, or that certain transactions are valid or not, and other worldly or religious matters, because these formed the main part of his mission, and Allaah has commanded us to obey the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in everything that he has conveyed from his Lord. (al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 1/45). Those who try to confine Islam only to rituals of worship, such as prayer, fasting and Hajj, and want to separate religion from other aspects of life such as the social, economic and political spheres, and say that these are human affairs in which people can do whatever they want and can legislate and govern however they wish – these people are kaafirs and wrongdoers who do not want to make the sharee’ah of Allaah prevail in people’s lives or to allow Islam to guide the people’s affairs, even though Allaah has revealed it to govern and control and regulate, and life cannot be properly run and people cannot be happy without it. Without Islamic rule, people are lost and confused in the darkness, as we see today in all those societies that are not ruled by the sharee’ah of Allaah.

Those (four) scholars have a high status that is well known throughout this Ummah; their words were written down and followed by their companions and followers, and became madhhabs that were recognized and known, even though they were agreed on matters of belief and Tawheed. They were also close to one another on minor issues, but it so happened that one of them might be unaware of some evidence (daleel) or its correct interpretation, so he made ijtihaad and issued fatwaas based on his ijtihaad. They did not oblige others to adhere to what they said, but most of those followers adopted sectarian attitudes and restricted themselves to the views of those imaams even if they went against the daleel. They went to great length to interpret the texts in such a manner as to make them agree with what they thought.

Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears by anything other than Allaah is guilty of kufr or shirk.” (Saheeh, narrated by Ahmad, 2/125; Abu Dawood, 3251; al-Tirmidhi, 1535). This applies to swearing by the Prophets, angels, righteous people and all other created beings. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath, let him swear by Allaah or else remain silent.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari,4860 – al-Fath 8/611 and 6107 – al-Fath 10/516; Muslim, 1647; Ahmad, 2/309; Abu Dawood, 3247; al-Nasaa’i, 3775; al-Tirmidhi, 1545; Ibn Maajah, 2096).

I was delighted to learn of your serious consideration and possible intention to accept the Islamic religion. No doubt that step would be the greatest thing in the entire NN years of your life. This step is the one that will protect you from the everlasting punishment of Hell and open to you the path to Heaven after death and will result in success and happiness in this life and the hereafter. I advise you to hasten with your decision and do not hesitate and postpone. You seem to me to be of sound wisdom that will lead you the path of truth by the will of God (Allaah). As for your first question, it is permissible in the Islamic religion for a Muslim to marry a woman from the People of the Book (Christain or Jew) if she is chaste (i.e. of high moral character) and virtuous, as Allaah has stated in the noble Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning of verse number 5 in the chapter entitled \"Al-Maa'ida,\" The Table): \"This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues (girlfriends or lovers)...\" Based on this verse, your marriage contract will remain valid if you accept Islaam and become a Muslim, and it will not require renewal. Your remaining with your current wife is permissible as long as she is virtuous and chaste in marriage. As for your second question, the child in Islamic law must follow the Muslim among his or her parents, and it is the Muslim parent's right and responsibility to ensure his or her proper upbringing, guidance, and supervision. Your statement that you would seek to expose your children to Islaam is a wise and judicious foresight. And we hope that with the passing of time that they will be convinced of this religion and implement it in their lives. No doubt that you will face some difficulty in convincing your wife to raise your children in the Islamic religion considering the promise you have made to her. However, the use of wisdom and gentle judgment will aid you, God willing, in overcoming this difficulty. This is important especially considering that it is expected that you will exert a concentrated effort in inviting your wife to Islam, since if she accepts it, the problem will be solved from its roots. In any case, and no matter what the results, the first step towards success will be your accepting the religion of Islaam yourself. We pray to God (Allaah) the Almighty and Magnificent that He eases your affairs and brings you success in finding the path of truth and that he guides your entire famliy to Islam. I would be more than happy to dicuss any other questions or concerns you may have. Salaam. Peace.\n",

      "Contents Related How often husband and wife make love Praise be to Allah.How often husband and wife make love Yes, the couple can have intercourse on the first night of their marriage if they want to. There is nothing in the Shari`ah to indicate the number of times a couple may or should have intercourse, because this varies according to circumstances and personal preferences. As long as people vary in their abilities, it is not possible for the Shari`ah to impose a specific number in such cases. But intercourse is the right of the wife and is a duty on the husband . Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Intercourse is a duty on the man – i.e., the husband should have intercourse with his wife – so long as he has no excuse. This is also the opinion of Malik.” (al-Mughni, 7/30) Imam al-Bukhari reported from ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘O ‘Abd-Allah, have I not heard that you fast all day and stand all night in prayer?’ I said, ‘Yes, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said: ‘Do not do that. Fast and break your fast, stand in prayer and sleep. For your body has rights over you, your eyes have rights over you, and your wife has rights over you.’” In the commentary on this hadith, it says: “The husband should not exhaust himself in worship to the extent that he becomes too weak to fulfil her rights by having intercourse with her and by earning a living.” (Fath al-Bari) It is also the wife’s right that her husband should spend his nights with her. Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali said: “If he has a wife, he should spend one night in four with her, so long as he has no excuse.” (Al-Mughni, 7/28; Kashf al-Qina’, 3/144). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “It is obligatory for the husband to have intercourse with his wife as much as is needed to satisfy her, so long as this does not exhaust him physically or keep him away from earning a living… If they dispute over this matter, the judge should prescribe more in the way of intercourse just as he may prescribe more in the way of spending.” (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah min Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 246) The Shari`ah also requires that a wife be protected from immorality by means of her husband having intercourse with her, as much as is needed to satisfy her and to provide this protection. But there is no way that this can be stated in terms of a specific period of time, such as four months, or more, or less. It should be defined according to the wife’s needs and her husband’s ability to fulfil her rights… All of this applies in normal circumstances, when the husband is present and living with his wife. If the husband is absent from his wife because he is travelling for a legitimate purpose or other legitimate excuse, in this case the husband should try not to be absent from his wife for too long. If he is absent because he is doing something for the benefit of the Muslims as a whole, such as participating in jihad for the sake of Allah or patrolling the borders of Islam, he should be permitted to go back to his family once every four months or less, so that he can spend time with them before returning to his duties in jihad or border patrol. This was the policy of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), who stipulated that soldiers and members of the border patrol should be absent from their wives for only four months, after which time they should be brought back and others sent to take their place…” (Al-Mufassal fi Ahkam al-Marah by Zaydan, 7/239) For more, please see these answers: 1202 , 91968 , 4807 , and 6792 .

      "Praise be to Allah. First of all, let me congratulate you for reaching a conviction that Islam is true and that it is the only religion which meets the needs of mans soul and fills it with tranquillity and joy. From the way in which you phrased your question, it is clear that what you have read about Islam has had an effect on you, so much so that if you had not stated that you are Hindu, we would have thought you were Muslim. The most important thing I want to say to you is to advise you to hasten to enter Islam, and do it sooner rather than later. Once a person is convinced of the truth, what reason is there to delay embracing Islam? There is another point which also needs to made clear. Some of those who want to enter Islam delay doing so until they have learnt some practical aspects of this faith, such as how to pray and so on, because they think that they are not fit to enter the religion until they have learnt some of its teachings. This is not correct; once the truth is clear to a person, it is his duty to follow it and enter Islam straight away. Then he can learn about the Quran and Sunnah and broaden his understanding of Islam. The Muslim is required to take learning and practice step by step, as much as he is able to, because no one knows when he or she will die. If a person meets Allaah (dies) with a religion other than Islaam, he will be one of the doomed. Furthermore, a person will not be rewarded and no hasanaat will be recorded for him until after he has entered Islaam, so he will lose a lot of benefits if he delays his Islaam; time wasted can never be recovered. Now let us go back to your question, which has to do with the thirty-ninth aayah of Soorah Yaa-Seen. In this aayah, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse)\" [Yaa-Seen 36:39], i.e., We have made it progress through stages by which the passing of months can be measured, just as night and day are known from the sun. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): \"They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage . . .\" [al-Baqarah 2:189] \"It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light , and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of their years and the reckoning. . .\" [Yoonus 10:5] Allaah has given the sun its own light and has given the moon a (reflection) of light, and has made their courses different, so that the sun rises every day and sets at the end of of the day with one unchanging kind of light, but the positions of its rising and setting vary from summer to winter, because of which the days may be long and the nights short, then the days become short and the nights long. The sun is dominant in the day, so it is the heavenly body of the daytime. As for the moon, Allaah has measured for it mansions or stages, so that on the first night of the month it rises as a faint crescent, giving little light, then its light increases in stages and its position gets higher each night. Every time its position is higher, it has more light, even though it is a reflection of the suns light, until its light becomes complete, on the fourteenth of the month, when it is a full moon. Then it starts to decrease until, at the end of the month, it \"returns like the old dried curved date stalk\" Ibn Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: \"This is the stalk of a bunch of dates.\" Mujaahid said: \"It is a dried stalk.\" Ibn Abbaas meant: the stalk of a bunch of dates when it becomes old, dry and bent. (Reference: Tafsir Ibn Katheer). This likening of the moon at the end of the month to an old dried curved date stalk is a beautiful example of eloquence, by choosing a simile from the environment of the first listeners. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah? Who are the Salaf? Can you say ‘I am a Salafi’? Response to the Sufi claims Your way to salvation Praise be to Allah.Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah? We can answer this question with the following points: Each person is obliged to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. This is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah and the followers of the righteous predecessors (al-salaf al-salih). Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): “Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me with sure knowledge. And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the mushrikeen (polytheists… those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah).” [Yusuf 12:108] “And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We shall keep him in the oath he has chosen, and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination!” [al-Nisa 4:115] Who are the Salaf? Whoever follows the way of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) belongs to the salaf al-salih , even if the people call him something else; by the same token, whoever goes against it and deviates from the Sunnah is an innovator, even if he claims to be a Salafi. Can you say ‘I am a Salafi’? If a person calls himself a Salafi to express his gratitude for having been guided to this way, or to clearly distinguish himself from innovation, then this is OK and is allowed in Islam. But if he says it only for the purpose of praising himself, then this is not allowed, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… therefore justify not yourselves…” [al-Najm 53:32]. Similarly, it is not allowed if it is said in a spirit of tribalism or sectarianism, because such attitudes are forbidden, as is clear from the following story: Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: “A man from the Muhajireen shoved a man from the Ansar from behind, so each man’s people gathered around him, saying ‘O Muhajireen (come and help)!’ or ‘O Ansar (come and help)!’ News of this reached the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said, ‘Stop this, for it is repulsive.’ Then he said, ‘What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah? What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah?’” (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 14105; the hadeeth is also to be found in al-Sahihayn). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called it the call of the people of jahiliyyah and described it as repulsive, even though the words “Ansari” and “Muhajiri” are Islamic words, the first referring to those who supported Allah and His Messenger, and the second referring to those who left the land of kufr and migrated to Allah and His Messenger. Why were they described in this manner? Because in this instance, the words were not used in a permissible fashion; the usage was a sectarian and political one that could have led to fighting between the two groups. The same applies to the word “Salafi”. If the Ahl al-Sunnah and the salaf draw a line between themselves and the innovators, this is not considered to be dividing the ummah, as those who criticize the use of this word think is the case, but this distancing of oneself has to be done in accordance with the degree of bid’ah – whether it is major or minor – and should be regulated by the overall interests of the Islamic da’wah. Response to the Sufi claims The Sufi claims mentioned in the question are not valid. The denunciation is not merely because of the word “Sufi”, which is a general word that may be applied to things approved of in Islam, such as asceticism (zuhd) and fear of Allah, or it may be applied to innovations such as monasticism and extremism. Rather the denunciation is because of the various types of shirk, major and minor, that are connected with Sufism and its tariqahs . The word Tasawwuf (Sufism) now refers to the Sufi tariqahs and the kinds of innovations they have. Sufism – as is obvious from their books and how Sufis actually are – includes deviant ideas of kufr, such as hulool (incarnation or the belief that the Creator may be indwelling in His creation – exalted be Allah above what they say), ittihad (union) and wahdat al-wujood (pantheism or the unity of existence, which is the belief that the Creator and His creation are the same thing, and that everything in existence is Allah – exalted be Allah above what they say), and going to extremes in what they say about the awliya, in addition to their innovations in the matter of acts of worship and awrad (du’as). Your way to salvation The one who is seeking salvation has to work hard to gain beneficial knowledge and do righteous deeds, and he should avoid vain arguments and futile discussions in which there is no benefit. We ask Allah to help us and you to follow the truth and act upon it. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.In the Tafseer of this aayah, it is reported that Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The five daily prayers are (mentioned) in the Qur’aan.” He was asked, “Where?” He said, “Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘So glorify Allaah when you come up to the evening’ is maghrib and ‘isha’; ‘and when you enter the morning’ is fajr; ‘in the afternoon’ is ‘asr; and ‘the time when the day begins to decline’ is zuhr.” Other mufassireen, such as al-Dahhaak and Sa’eed ibn Jubayr said the same thing. Some of the mufassireen said that these aayat mention only four of the prayers; ‘isha’ is not mentioned here, but it is mentioned in Soorat Hood, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and in some hours of the night…” [Hood 11:114] Most of the mufassireen are of the first opinion. Al-Nahhaas (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “The scholars of Tafseer say that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘So glorify Allaah when you come up to the evening and when you enter the morning…’ [al-Room 30:17] refers to the prayers.” Imaam al-Jassaas (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… The prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed times [mawqootan].’ [al-Nisa’ 4:103]. It was reported that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: ‘[Mawqootan means that] Salaah has an appointed time just as Hajj does.’ It was reported that Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid and ‘Atiyyah said [that mawqootan means] ‘It is obligatory’… The word ‘mawqootan’ means that it is obligatory at certain times. The times are referred to in general terms in this aayah and are explained elsewhere in the Book, without defining precisely when those times start and end – that was explained in detail by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What Allaah mentioned about the times of the prayers in His Book is (interpretation of the meaning): “Perform al-Salaah from mid-day till the darkness of the night and recite the Qur’aan in the early dawn…” [al-Isra’ 17:78]. Mujaahid reported from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “’Mid-day’ means when the sun has passed its zenith for salaat al-zuhr, and ‘the darkness of the night’ means the beginning of the night, for salaat al-maghrib.” It was also reported from Ibn ‘Umar that mid-day meant the zenith… Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And perform al-salaah at the two ends of the day and in some parts of the night” [Hood 11:114]. ‘Amr reported from al-Hasan that ‘the two ends of the day’ means fajr at the first end and zuhr and ‘asr at the other; ‘some parts of the night’ means maghrib and ‘isha’. So according to this opinion the aayah refers to all five prayers…. Layth reported from al-Hakam from Abu ‘Ayyaad that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “This aayah mentions all five prayers together. ‘So glorify Allaah when you come up to the evening’ refers to maghrib and ‘isha’, ‘and when you enter the morning’ refers to fajr, ‘in the afternoon’ is ‘asr; and ‘the time when the day begins to decline’ is zuhr.” Something similar was also reported from al-Hasan. Abu Razeen reported from Ibn ‘Abbaas: “ ‘…and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting’ [Qaaf 50:39 – interpretation of the meaning] refers to the prescribed prayers. ‘… and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and during some of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day, that you may become pleased with the reward which Allaah shall give you.’ [Ta-Ha 20:130 – interpretation of the meaning] This aayah also includes the times of the prayers. All of these aayaat mention the times of the prayers.” Ahkaam al-Qur’aan by al-Jassaas, Baab Mawaaqeet al-Salaah. What you should also know is that the Qur’aan does not contain details of all the rules. The Qur’aan mentions many rules, but it also tells us that the Sunnah is a source of evidence in which many rules are mentioned in detail that are not mentioned in the Qur’aan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “… and We have also sent down to you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Qur’aan), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them and that they may give thought.” [al-Nahl 16:44] “… and whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it…” [al-Hashr 59:7] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have been given the Qur’aan and something like it with it…” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 16546; this is a saheeh hadeeth). Whether the rules were narrated in the Qur’aan or in the Sunnah, all of it is true and right, and all of it has one source, which is the wahy or revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The reports that have been narrated concerning appointing an ameer refer specifically to when people are travelling, because when people are travelling they need to be able to refer their opinions to a leader or ameer. But when people are not travelling, usually each individual is busy with his own affairs and they do not need an ameer. But they may appoint someone to be the head of their society or group, so if for example they are living in a flat, they may say” we need someone to organize our affairs in this flat, so we will appoint So and so to be our head or ameer.” Then they can discuss with him the running of this household’s affairs, such as what kind of food to have, setting times of rest, deciding what needs to be bought, and so on, so they discuss these things with him and agree to accept what he says. This is correct, in sha Allaah.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Your question may be answered by the following points: There is no doubt that the Prophet of Allaah Ibraaheem (Abraham) was a pure monotheist, and he was not among the polytheists and disbelievers. Although the Jews are among the offspring of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), they went against his way by associating partners in worship with Allaah and claiming that Uzayr (Ezra) was a son of God. They said that God is miserly and that His hand is tied up, and they said, He is poor and we are rich. They also said that when God created the heavens and the earth in six days, He got tired, so He rested on the Sabbath day exalted be Allaah far above all that they say about Him. They also likened the attributes of God to human attributes (anthropomorphism) and killed the Prophets, etc., etc. Once this distinction and contrast is made clear, there can be no brotherhood between a monotheistic believer and a polytheistic disbeliever, as Allaah says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah. We have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred forever, - until you believe in Allaah Alone, except the saying of Ibraaheem to his father: Verily, I will ask for forgiveness (from Allaah) for you, but I have no power to do anything for you before Allaah. Our Lord! In You (Alone) we put our trust, and to You (Alone) we turn in repentance, and to You (Alone) is (our) final Return, - Certainly, there has been in them an excellent example for you to follow, - for those who look forward to (the Meeting with) Allaah (for the reward from Him) and the Last Day. And whosoever turn away, then verily, Allaah is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all Praise. [al-Mumtahinah 60:4,6] Once this separation and enmity is clear, it is unavoidable that there will be hostility and disavowal and the resulting struggle against the enemies of Allaah. So long as the laws and wisdom of Allaah dictate that there should the distinction between believers and disbelievers, there has to be this clearly-stated enmity. There can be no change to the laws of Allaah. There cannot be harmony between Jews who are usurpers and aggressors, who have oppressed and persecuted others, and who are known for their treachery and corruption throughout the world, historically and in the present age and the purely monotheistic Muslim owners of the land, whose menfolk the Jews have killed, and imprisoned their sons, and destroyed their homes, and taken possession of their lands by force, and prevented them from earning a proper living, and carried out chemical and radiational experiments on their prisoners, and taken organs from them for transplant into Jewish patients and all other kinds of persecutions and atrocities. In addition to this, the Jews are people of treachery and betrayal; it is not possible to trust them at all. Their current conduct bears this out: is there any treaty or agreement signed by them that they have actually fulfilled? This is no big surprise for the Muslims, who know what Allaah has said in His Book about the Jews (interpretation of the meaning): Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throws it aside? Nay! The truth is most of them believe not. [al-Baqarah 2:100]. Moreover, if the Muslims agreed to live in peace with the Jews, who would be in charge? One of the basic principles of Islam is that Islam should prevail, not be prevailed over. One of the conditions for People of the Book (Jews and Christians) living with Muslims in a Muslim country is that they should live under certain conditions (shuroot ahl al-dhimmah) in return for the security and protection afforded them by the Muslims. One of the most important of these conditions is that they should not openly display their shirk and kufr (polytheistic disbelief) in the Muslim lands, whether by word or deed. As the Muslims and Jews are enemies residing in opposing religious and doctrinal camps, it is not possible for them to be brought together unless one is made to submit to the other by force. Indeed, the Jews now are not allowing the Muslims to remain in their homes, even if there was no provocative action on the part of the Muslims; they are seizing the Muslims property by force, building their settlements on the Muslims lands and expelling the Muslims by any means. They have expelled millions to the neighbouring countries, which have accommodated them in the so-called Palestinian refugee camps. Finally, although the Muslims nowadays are in a position of weakness and humiliation because they have turned away from their religion and are unable to fight the Jews, take back their stolen lands and impose the rule of Islamic shareeah in Palestine, this does not mean that this will always be the case until the end of the world. Things have to change, and one of the indications of this is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who informed us of some things that are to happen in the future. He was supported by Revelation from his Lord; he did not speak of his own whims and desires, but of that which was revealed to him. He said: You will fight the Jews and will prevail over them, so that a rock will say, O Muslim! There is Jew behind me, kill him! (Reported by Muslim, 2921; al-Bukhaari, 2926). According to a report narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Hour [the Day of Judgement] will not begin until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. A Jew will hide behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say, O Muslim, O slave of Allaah! There is a Jew behind me, come and kill him! except for the gharqad (box thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews. (Reported by Muslim, 2922). We would like to express our appreciation for your question, your desire to find out the truth, and the polite and eloquent manner in which your inquiry was phrased. We invite you to believe in Allaah as your Lord, in Islam as your religion, and in Muhammad as your Prophet, for this by Allaah will save you and benefit you and protect you in this world, in the grave after death, and in the Hereafter on the Day of Reckoning. May Allaah help us and you to do all that is good.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to eat dogs, or to give them to people who will eat them, because it is haraam to eat them or to help anyone else to eat them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every animal that has fangs is haraam.” (Reported by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him). According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu Tha’labah al-Khashani (may Allaah be pleased with him), “the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the eating of every carnivorous animal that has fangs.” (Agreed upon). Dogs are carnivores that have fangs. You have to repent to Allaah for what you have done, and Allaah is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Your apology is accepted. Striving to understand the rulings of Sharee'ah in this and similar matters is not haraam or shameful; it is necessary. As regards your question, anal intercourse with one's wife is a major sin, whether it occurs at the time of menstruation or not. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) cursed the one who does this: \"Cursed is the one who approaches his wife in her rectum\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 2/479; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5865). The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) also said: \"The one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her rectum, or who goes to a fortune-teller, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1/243; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5918). In spite of the fact that many wives of sound nature refuse this, there are some husbands who threaten their wives with divorce if they do not obey them (in this matter), and some even deceive their wives, who are too shy to ask scholars about it, into thinking that it is permissible. The Prophet SAWS (Peace & Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said that a man may approach his wife in any way he likes, from the front or the back, so long as intercourse takes place in the place from through which a child is born. There is no doubt that the rectum is the place from which waste matter is expelled, not the place from which a child is born. Another reason why some may commit this immoral act is that they enter upon what should be a clean married life with some jaahili (ignorant) traditions and odd practices, or with memories of scenes from indecent movies, for which they have not repented to Allaah. It is known that this act is forbidden even if both partners agree to it. Mutual consent to a haraam deed does not make it halaal. I ask Allah to bestow upon us a proper understanding of His religion and to make us adhere to its limits, for He is the All-Hearing, the One Who answers prayers.\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah. The general principle is that women are equal to men in all religious rulings, because of the hadeeth \"Women are the twin halves of men\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and classified as saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami’ 1983), except when there is evidence (daleel) of a specific ruling which applies only to women. One of the cases in which the scholars mention specific rules for women is prayer, where there are differences as follows: Women do not have to give adhaan or iqaamah, because adhaan requires raising the voice, which women are not permitted to do. Ibn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"We know of no difference between the scholars (on this point).\" (Al-Mughni ma’a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 1/438). All of the woman’s body is ‘awrah and must be covered during prayer, except for her face, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"No prayer will be accepted from an adult woman unless she wears a khimaar (head-cover). (Reported by the five Muhadditheen) There is some dispute as to whether her heels and feet should be covered. The author of al-Mughni (2/328) said: \"As for the rest of the free woman’s body, it must be covered during prayer. If any part becomes uncovered, it renders her prayer invalid, except if only a little bit is uncovered. Maalik, al-Oozaa’i and al-Shaafi’i said the same. The woman should keep her limbs close to her body during rukoo’ and sujood, and not spread them out, because this is more modest and covering. (Al-Mughni 2/258). Al-Nawawi said: \"Al-Shaafi’i said, in al-Mukhtasar: there is no difference between men and women in prayer, except that women should keep the parts of their bodies close to one another, and they should make their stomachs touch their thighs during sujood. This is more covering and preferable, in rukoo’ and the rest of the prayer too.\" (See al-Majmoo’ 3/429). It is preferable for women to pray in congregation, led by one of their number, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told Umm Waraqah to lead the women of her household in prayer. There is some difference among scholars on this matter. (See al-Mughni, 2/202 and al-Majmoo’ al-Nawawi, 4/84-85). The woman leading the prayer should read aloud as long as no non-mahram man can hear her. It is permissible for women to go out and pray in the mosque with men, although their prayer at home is better for them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Do not prevent the women from going out to the mosques, even though their homes are better for them.\" (For more details on this matter, see Question#973). Imaam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said (al-Majmoo’ 3/455): \"Women differ from men in congregational prayer in a number of ways: (1) Congregational prayer is not required of them in the same way as it is of men. (2) The imam of a group of women stands in the middle of the (first) row. (3) (If one woman and one man are praying), she should stand behind him, not next to him. (4) If women are praying in rows behind men, the back rows are better for them than the front rows. What we can learn from the above is that women and men are forbidden to mix. Allaah is our Helper and Support.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to watch these kinds of movies which tell stories of shirk. Seeing and hearing them can cause serious damage to the heart of the Muslim. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) got angry with Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) when he saw him with a piece of the Tawraat (Torah) in his hand, and told him to destroy it. Many of the Muslims do not have sufficient protection or the level of knowledge required to recognize the corrupt ideas in these movies, so some viewers may develop doubts that damage their eemaan and shake their belief; they may start to believe some of the false ideas and their hearts may be filled with evil poisons as a result of watching these movies. This is in addition to the haraam content in many of these movies, such as pictures of women, music and so on. We may also note the recent appearance of movies based on distorted Biblical beliefs or the false prophecies of liars and charlatans. These movies have become very popular in the West because of the spiritual vacuum resulting from the lack of true religion. Due to the environment surrounding the Muslims in western countries, some of them have started to follow these movies. Muslims should fear their Lord and avoid watching these films of kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily! The hearing, and the sight, of each of those you will be questioned by Allaah.

So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honor him, help him and follow the light (the Qur’aan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.\" [al-A’raaf 7:157] Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: \"Allaah says ‘al-ummi.’ Ibn ‘Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: ‘Your Prophet was unlettered, unable to read or write or calculate.’ Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Qur’an), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand . . .’ [al-‘Ankaboot 29:48].\" Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of the second aayah quoted [al-‘Ankaboot 29:48]: \"Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Qur’aan), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand . . .’ i.e., ‘you (O Muhammad) lived among your people for a while before you brought this Qur’aan to them, and you never read any book or were able to write anything. Everyone among your people and others knows that you are an unlettered man, who does not read or write.’ This is how he was described in the previous Books as Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read not write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat and the Injeel, - he commands them for al-Ma’roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islaam has ordained); and forbids them from al-Munkar (i.e., disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islaam has forbidden) . . .’ [al-A’raaf 7:157]. Hence the Prophet will remain unable to write even one line or one letter, until the Day of Resurrection. He had scribes who would write down in front of him the Revelation and letters to different regions. . . . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘. . . In that case, indeed, the followers of falsehood might have doubted.’ [al-‘Ankaboot 29:48], i.e., if you had been good at it (reading and writing), some of the ignorant people would have doubted you and said that you had learnt this from the previous Books left by the Prophets. Indeed, they say this despite the fact that they know he was unlettered and unable to write, as it says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And they say: \"Tales of the ancients, which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.\"’ [al-Furqaan 25:5]\" Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book and al-Hikmah (al-Sunnah). And verily, they had been before in manifest error.\" [al-Jumu’ah 62:2] Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: \"It was said: ‘the unlettered ones’ means those who do not write. Such were the Quraysh. Mansoor reported from Ibraaheem, who said: ‘Al-ummi (the unlettered one) is the one who neither reads nor writes. \"A Messenger from among themselves\" means Muhammad , who was unlettered and never read a book nor learned how.’ Al-Mawardi said: ‘What is good about the fact that Allaah sent an unlettered Prophet? There are three things: (i) his message fulfilled the foretelling of the previous Prophets; (ii) this made him similar to and closer to other Prophets (illiterates); (iii) this would eliminate all suspicion that he had learned the message he preached from books and writings that he had read.\" I say: all of this is evidence of the miraculous nature and truth of his Prophethood. (The above has been summarized from the Tafseer of al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him).\n",

      "Contents Related The Quran prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends The Sunnah prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends The ruling of having girlfriends and boyfriends in Islam Praise be to Allah.The Quran prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Wed them with the permission of their own folk and give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends…” [al-Nisa 4:25] In his commentary on this ayah, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Muhsanat [translated as “chaste”] means that they should be pure, not indulging in zina (unlawful sexual conduct), hence they are described as not being musafihat , which means promiscuous women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them. Regarding the phrase wa la muttakhidhati akhdan (‘nor taking boyfriends’), Ibn 'Abbas said: ‘al-musafihat means those who are known to commit zina, meaning those who will not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them.’ Ibn 'Abbas also said: ‘muttakhidhati akhdan means lovers.’ A similar interpretation was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Mujahid, al-Sha’bi, al-Dahhak, ‘Ata al-Khurasani, Yahya ibn Abi Kathir, Muqatil ibn Hayyan and al-Saddi. They said: (it means) lovers. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: ‘It means a (male) friend.’ Al-Dahhak also said: ‘wa la muttakhidhati akhdan also means a woman who has just one boyfriend or lover with whom she is happy. Allah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that situation…’” Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Made lawful to you this day are al-tayyibat [all kinds of halal (lawful) foods…]. The food of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time, when you have given their due mahr (bridal money given by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other articles of Faith, then fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.” [al-Maidah 5:5] Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Muhsineen ghayr musafiheen wa la muttakhidhi akhdan (‘desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends’ ). Just as Allah imposed the condition of chastity on women, meaning that they refrain from zina, so it is also imposed on men. The man must also be pure and chaste. So they should be ghayr musafiheen, meaning they should not be adulterers who do not refrain from sin and do not refuse any who come to them (for immoral purposes). Nor should they be muttakhidhi akhdan, meaning those who have girlfriends or female lovers with whom they have an exclusive relationship, as quoted above from Surat al-Nisa. (The one with many lovers or the one with just one lover) are both the same. For this reason Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him) said that it is not right to marry a promiscuous woman unless she has repented, or to arrange a marriage of such a woman to a chaste man, so long as she is still conducting herself in this manner. Similarly, he (Ahmad) says that it is not right for a promiscuous man to marry a chaste woman unless he repents and gives up his immoral conduct, because of this ayah… We will discuss this matter in further detail after quoting the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Let no man guilty of fornication or adultery marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the believers such a thing is forbidden.” [al-Nur 24:3] The Sunnah prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends Among the stories that show that it is forbidden to have girlfriends or to marry them is the story of Marthad ibn Abi Marthad, who used to smuggle Muslim prisoners-of-war from Makkah to Madinah. There was a prostitute in Makkah, called ‘Anaq, who had been a friend of Marthad’s. Marthad had promised to take one of the prisoners from Makkah to Madinah. He said: “I came to the shade of one of the gardens of Makkah on a moonlit night, then ‘Anaq came and saw my shadow by the garden. When she reached me, she recognized me and said: ‘Marthad?’ I said, ‘Marthad.’ She said: ‘Welcome! Stay with us tonight.’ I said, ‘O ‘Anaq, Allah has forbidden zina (unlawful sexual relations)’ … I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him, ‘O Messenger of Allah, should I marry ‘Anaq?’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent and did not answer me at all, until the ayah ‘Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman; to the believers such a thing is forbidden’ [al-Nur 24:3 – Yusuf ‘Ali’s translation] was revealed. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘O Marthad, Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman, so do not marry her.’” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3101; he said: it is a hasan gharib hadith). ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mughaffal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: “Stop it! (Mah! A word connoting a rebuke or denunciation). Allah has done away with shirk and had brought Islam.” So he left her alone and went away, still looking at her, until he walked into a wall, hitting his face. He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “You are a man for whom Allah wishes good. When Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, wishes good for His slave, He hastens the punishment for his sin, so that it is dealt with before the Day of Resurrection.” (Reported by al-Hakim, 1/349, who said this hadith is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. See Sahih al-Jami’, 308). The ruling of having girlfriends and boyfriends in Islam These ayat and ahadith clearly indicate that it is haram (forbidden) for men to have any kind of friendship or relationship with non-mahram women (women to whom they are not closely-related and to whom they could get married). The evil consequences and misery caused by such relationships are obvious to anyone who observes real life. A similar question has been asked under #2085 . We ask Allah to keep us far away from that which is forbidden, to protect us from all that may earn His wrath and to keep us safe from a painful punishment. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

If he pays zakaah on it before he gets it, that is fine. If the person who owes the money is not rich, he should pay zakaah one year after he gets the money, even if more than a year has passed.

Seeing that the money you have is in the form of paper currency paid to you as a grant from the Japanese government, the easiest way for you with regard to paying zakaah in this case is: wait until after one hijri year has passed, then check your bank and pay 2.5% (twenty-five out of every thousand) from whatever you have. But if you are living hand to mouth, as it were (i.e., spending it all straightaway), and you do not have enough left to reach the level of the nisaab, and a year has passed, then you are not obliged to pay zakaah in this case.

      "Related Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to join in the kaafir festivals for the following reasons: Firstly: because this entails imitating or resembling them, and “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood). This is a serious warning. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-‘Aas said: Whoever lives in the land of the mushrikeen and celebrates their Nawrooz (New Year) and their Mahrajaan (festivals), and imitates them until he dies, he will be a loser on the Day of Resurrection. Secondly: taking part in their festivals is a kind of befriending them and showing love for them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliyaa’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliyaa’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliyaa’), then surely, he is one of them… “[al-Maa’idah 5:51] “O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists) as friends, showing affection towards them” [al-Mumtahanah 60:1] Thirdly: festivals are the matter of religion and beliefs, not the matter of worldly customs, as is indicated by the hadeeth: “Every nation has its Eid, and this is our Eid.” Their Eid or festival reflects their corrupt beliefs of Kufr and Shirk. Fourthly: “And those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass it by with dignity” [al-Furqaan 25:72 – interpretation of the meaning]. The scholars interpreted this aayah was referring to the festivals of the mushrikeen. It is not permissible to give any of them cards for their festivals, or to sell them cards or any of the other things they need for their festivals such as lights, trees or food – including turkey, candy canes, etc. We have already answered a similar question, for more details please see Question #947.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. There is evidence in the Qur’aan that the people of Paradise will remember the life of this world. For example, in Soorat al-Toor, Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): \"And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: ‘Aforetime, we were afraid with our families (of the punishment of Allaah). But Allaah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful.\" [al-Toor 52:25-28] They will also remember the evil people who tried to make the people of faith have doubts and called them to kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning. A speaker of them will say, ‘Verily, I had a companion (in the world), who used to say, \"Are you among those who believe (in resurrection after death), (that) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)?\" [al-Saffaat 37:50-53] They will remember the trials and tribulations they went though in this world, with regard to themselves, their children, their families and their wealth, and they will say joyfully: \"… ‘All praise and thanks be to Allaah, Who has removed from us (all) grief. Verily, our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (good deeds and to recompense).’\" [Faatir 35:34] They will also be reminded of this life when they see the fruits which will resemble those which they used to eat in this world, but whose size and taste are different. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"… Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: ‘This is what we were provided with before,’ and they will be given things in resemblance (i.e., in the same form but different in taste)…\" [al-Baqarah 2:25] They will also recall their du’aa’s in times of hardship, when they raised their hands to heaven asking for their deeds to be accepted and for help to do righteous deeds and to be included among those who would inherit blessings. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: ‘Aforetime, we were afraid with out families (of the punishment of Allaah). But Allaah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful.\" [al-Toor 52:25-28] As regards the matter of them desiring something like the blessings of this world, they will in fact desire something better than that, because even the person who is the lowest in status in Paradise will enjoy something like ten times the joys of this world. ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘I know who will be the last person to be brought out of Hell and the last person to enter Paradise. It will be a man who will come out of Hell crawling. Allaah will say to him, \"Go and enter Paradise.\" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, \"O Lord, I found it full.\" Allaah will say to him a second time, \"Go and enter Paradise.\" So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, \"O Lord, I found it full.\" Allaah will say to him, \"Go and enter Paradise, for there you will have something like the world and ten times more.\" The man will say, \"Are You making fun of me (or are You laughing at me), and You are the King of all?\"’ - and I saw the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) smiling so broadly that his back teeth could be seen. He used to say, ‘That is the person who is lowest in status in Paradise.’\" [Agreed upon; this version is reported by Muslim, no. 272] Everything that the people of Paradise desire will be theirs, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"… (there will be) therein all that one’s inner-self could desire, all that the eyes could delight in, and you will abide therein forever.\" [al-Zukhruf 43:71] A number of ahaadeeth state that the people of Paradise will have their desires for children or to grow things fulfilled, without having to wait for them. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was speaking about the people of Paradise one day when a Bedouin was present. He described how a man of the people of Paradise will ask his Lord’s permission to grow some plants. (In Arabic, the past tense is used here to show that this will undoubtedly happen). Allaah will ask him, \"Do you not already have all that you want?\" He will say, \"Yes, but I like to grow things.\" So he will go and plant his seeds, and within the blinking of an eye they will grow, ripen, be harvested and piled up like mountains. Allaah will say, \"Here you are, O son of Adam, nothing makes you satisfied!\" The Bedouin said, \"O Messenger of Allaah, you will find that he is either from Quraysh or the Ansaar, for they are the ones who like to grow things; we don’t like to grow anything!\" The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) smiled broadly. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6965). Ibn Hijr reported the following hadeeth in Fath al-Baari; from it we learn that whatever worldly desires one wishes for in Paradise can be fulfilled. Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"If the believer in Paradise wishes for a child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in an instant.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2487. Abu ‘Eesaa said: This is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6649) We ask Allaah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and Mercy. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.In the chapters of their books which discuss who is entitled to receive zakaah funds, the scholars have stated that these funds are not to be given to a kaafir or an innovator (follower of bid’ah). The Raafidis are undoubtedly kuffaar for four reasons: They cast aspersions on the Qur’aan, claiming that two-thirds of it has been omitted, as is stated in their book by al-Noori which is called Fasl al-Khitaab fi Ithbaat Tahreef Kitaab Rabb al-Arbaab, and in Al-Kaafi, and other books. Whoever casts aspersions on the Qur’aan is a kaafir who disbelieves in the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): “and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)” [al-Hijr 15:9] They cast aspersions upon the Sunnah and the saheeh ahaadeeth. They do not follow them, because they were narrated from the Sahaabah who, according to them, are kuffaar. They believe that the Sahaabah became kaafirs after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, apart from ‘Ali and his descendents, Salmaan, ‘Ammaar and a few others. But with regard to the first three khaleefahs and the majority of the Sahaabah who gave their bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to them, they think that they all apostatized and became kaafirs, so their ahaadeeth cannot be accepted. This is stated in al-Kaafi and other books of theirs. They regard the Sunnis (Ahl al-Sunnah) as kaafirs, so they do not pray with you. Whoever prays behind a Sunni will repeat his prayer. Indeed, they think that we are naajis (impure), and when they shake hands with us they go and wash their hands. Whoever regards the Muslims as kaafirs is himself a kaafir, so we regard them as kaafirs just as they regard us as kaafirs, and more so. They commit clear shirk in their exaggerations about ‘Ali and his descendents and in their calling upon them alongside Allaah. This is stated clearly in their books, where they exaggerate about them and describe them in terms that are befitting only for the Lord of the Worlds. We have heard this in their tapes. They do not participate in the charity work of the Ahl al-Sunnah, or give charity to the Sunni poor; if they do these things, it is with deeply rooted and hidden hatred, and they do that as a form of taqiyyah (dissimulation, calculated deception). On these grounds, anyone who has given zakaah to them must pay his zakaah again, because he has given it to someone who will be helped in his kufr and to wage war against the Sunnah thereby. Whoever is obliged to pay zakaah is forbidden to give it to a Raafidi; if he does this, he has not discharged his obligation and he has to pay it again because he did not give the money with which he had been entrusted to the people who were entitled to receive it. Whoever doubts this, let him read the books that have been written in refutation of them, such as the book by al-Qifaari which refutes their way, and al-Khutoot al-‘Areedah by al-Khateeb, and the books of Ehsan Ilahi Zaheer, and others.

      "Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him: If a woman whose pregnancy has reached full term passes blood and has pains, but she does not know whether these are the contractions that will lead to childbirth or contractions that will later ease off [“practice” contractions, also known as Braxton-Hicks contractions], should she pray or not? He answered, may Allaah preserve him: Of course, there are two things we may assume here: The first is that the pregnancy will continue without contractions. The second is that the apparent case is that these are contractions, so she should stop praying. If this is what usually happens to her, and she may carry on having contractions for four or five days without giving birth, then in this case she should still pray. Question: If she acts upon the second assumption, then the contractions ease off, should we tell her to make up the prayers she has missed? Answer: It is preferable to make them up, because she took her decision on the basis of an assumption. In summary, then: If this woman usually has contractions for a number of days – more than two or three – then this is not nifaas and she should pray. If that is not what usually happens, then we assume that it is nifaas in the sense that she should stop praying. If she stops praying, then it turns out that it was not nifaas, then in this case we say that if she makes up the prayers she has missed, this is good, and if she does not make them up, there is nothing wrong with that because she acted on an assumption.

(Some Muslim scholars that he should be physically reprimanded if he does not fast by the age of 10, which is the same rule that is applied to prayer; refer to Al Mughni 3/90). The boy will get a reward for fasting and his parents will get a reward for teaching him well and guiding him to that which is good. Al Rubayyi’ bint Mu’awwadh (may Allaah be pleased with her) said about fasting ‘Aashouraa’ at the time when it was mandatory to fast it and not voluntary: we used to make our young boys fast, and we made them a toy made out of wool. If one of the boys cried [wanting] food, we would give him [the toy to distract him] until it was time to break the fast.\" (Al Bukhari Fath # 1960). (Ashouraa is the tenth day of the month of Muharram. Although fasting this day is now voluntary the majority of Muslims usually fast.) Some people are quite lenient and lax when it comes to making their children fast. A situation may even arise where the young child feels enthusiastic and chooses to fast and is physically capable of doing so, then his father or mother order him to break his fast claiming that it is out of sympathy. Little do they know that real sympathy is in stressing the importance of fasting and teaching the child about it. Allaah said in Surat ul-Tahreem (interpretation of the meaning): \"O you who believe! Ward yourselves and your families off from a fire (Hell) whose fuel is of men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern and severe, who do not disobey the commands they receive from Allaah, and execute that which they are commanded.\" We must pay extra attention to the young girl when she first starts fasting after she reaches puberty.

We ought to ask ourselves; is it really beyond our reach to have a large enough place, even if it were to be in a park, a stadium, etc., which would be sufficient to cater for the large number of praying people? How were our Muslim ancestors performing their Salaat-ul ‘Eed? Did not they perform it in an open place nearby their town, even though it might have been on a rainy or chilly day, which was the practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him). However, let us assume that the matter is neither due to laziness nor disorganisation, nor due to the fact that they are accustomed to performing Salaat in enclosed places and are not acclimated to performing it in open places. If all the aforementioned is true and the excuse is a valid one, the solution, as Shaikh Abdul-Azeez Ibn Baaz states, is to have numerous places where the Salaat can be performed, not through holding many congregations [at the same place].

As al-Bukhaari narrates from Mu’aawiyah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called this falsehood. If we understand the hadeeth and the wisdom behind this prohibition, we will see that it does not include the wearing of ribbons and flower-shaped decorations by young girls. As long as wearing ribbons on the braids or necklaces made of white ribbon are not customs that belong exclusively to the kuffaar, there is nothing wrong with doing these things, because the principle is that everything is allowed unless it is expressly forbidden. But the girls who do these things should cover these decorations in front of people who are not their mahrams (blood relatives whom they are permanently forbidden to marry), if they are at the age where covering themselves is obligatory.

Imaam Ahmad, al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Be different from the mushrikeen: let your beards grow and trim your moutsaches.” Ahmad and Muslim reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Cut your moustaches and let your beards grow: be different from the Magians.” Persisting in shaving one’s beard is a major sin (kabeerah); the one who does this should be advised against it, and his action should be denounced, especially if he is in a position of religious leadership. The idea of being different from the Magians and other mushrikeen does not mean being different from them in every single thing, particularly if they happen to be doing something righteous or good in accordance with the fitrah (natural inclinations of man). What is meant is that we should be different from them in matters where they have gone astray and deviated from the truth and the dictates of the fitrah, and gone against the way of the Prophets and Messengers by shaving their beards. We should differ from them in this case by letting our beards grow and cutting our moustaches, following the guidance of the Prophets and Messengers, and in accordance with the fitrah. It is proven that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Ten things are part of the fitrah: cutting the moustache, letting the beard grow, cleaning the teeth with a siwaak, rinsing the nose with water, cutting one’s nails, washing between the finger-joints, plucking the armpit hairs, shaving the pubic hair and cleaning one’s private parts with water.” (Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and the four authors of Sunan, from the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her). Even if the kaafiroon start letting their beards grow, this does not mean that the Muslims are allowed to shave theirs, because as we have stated above, the idea is not to be different from them in everything, only in the things in which they have deviated from the truth and from the fitrah.\n",

If a woman wears a wig and adorns herself with it, even if she does this for her husband, she is imitating the kaafir women, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” Wigs also come under the ruling about hair extensions, which is even more vehement in its prohibition: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade this practice and cursed the one who does it.

The medical information that is currently available states that the AIDS virus is not transmitted through living with a person or touching him; it is not airborne; it is not transmitted through insects or through sharing food, drink, swimming pools, seats, eating utensils, and whatever else has to do with the ordinary details of living together day by day. The disease is primarily transferred in one of the following ways: Sexual contact, of whatever kind. Transfusion of infected blood or blood products. Using infected needles, especially among those who use drugs; using infected razors. AIDS may be passed from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy or childbirth. On the basis of the above, it is not necessary to isolate infected people from their healthy colleagues if there is no fear of them passing on the disease. The patient may be dealt with according to regular medical procedures. Secondly: deliberately transmitting the disease. Deliberately passing on AIDS to a healthy person is the deliberate commission of a haraam (forbidden) deed, and is counted as a serious major sin. It requires a punishment in this world, to be determined in accordance with the level of the crime and its impact on individuals and society as a whole. If the intention was to spread this terrible disease in society, this is counted as a kind of aggression and spreading mischief on earth, which should be met with one of the punishments referred to in the aayah: “The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.” [al-Maa’idah 5:33] If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, and this is what happens, but the person who has been infected has not yet died, the person who did this should be punished with ta’zeer (a punishment to be determined by the qaadi or judge). If the infected person dies, then the matter of execution should be looked into. If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, but this does not happen, then he should be punished with ta’zeer. Thirdly: considering AIDS to be a terminal illness: In sharee’ah, AIDS is counted as a terminal illness once it is full-blown and the patient is no longer living a normal life and death is approaching.\n",

There can be no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator, and obedience to any other created being should only be with regard to what is good (ma’roof). What you describe of your father being angry and upset because you are letting your beard grow is only because he loves you and is afraid that what has happened to others may happen to you too. But what happened to others was, in most cases, because of provocation on their part, not just because they let their beards grow; it also happened to some of those who shave their beards. You must be steadfast in your adherence to the truth, and continue to let your beard grow in obedience to Allaah and in order to earn His pleasure, even if His creatures are angry. You must also avoid the sources of trouble, and put your trust in Allaah, hoping that He will provide a way out for you. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “… And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).

(Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/173) Another bad habit that many people have is to leave one nail long. All of this is clearly contrary to the ways of the fitrah. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. Allah is the Guide to the Straight Path. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger and his family and companions. Celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is an innovation (bid’ah) which goes against the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and of the Rightly Guided Khaleefahs (al-khulafaa’ al-raashidoon) and the Sahaabah, may Allaah be pleased with them. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever does anything that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected.” (For more details, please see Question # 249). Believing that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is not like the rest of humanity, and that he is light from the Light of Allaah Himself is not a correct belief, because it contradicts the Qur’aan. Allaah has stated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is human, and has explained what makes the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) different from the rest of mankind. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): ‘I am only a man like you. It has been inspired to me that your God is One God (Allaah). So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.” [al-Kahf 18:110] Mankind, human beings, are created, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him He created his wife (Hawwa/Eve), and from them both He created many men and women…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:1] “O mankind, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily! We have created you from dust, then from a nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge)…” [al-Hajj 22:5] “O Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as witness, and a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner, - and as one who invites to Allaah by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light.” [al-Ahzaab 33:45-46] In contrast, Allaah is the First, and He has no beginning, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him), and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing.” [al-Hadeed 57:3] Allaah called His Prophet “light” and a “lamp spreading light” because of the guidance and light with which Allaah sent him, with which Allaah guides all those who answer his call (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Indeed, there has come to you a light (Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) and a plain Book (this Qur’aan).” [al-Maa’idah 5:15] Saying that he is present and watching in every place, that he is himself present at every gathering to celebrate his birthday, and that he hears what the people present are saying, is all false. There is no basis for this in either the Qur’aan or the Sunnah. Calling on him and seeking his help and support is a form of major shirk which is not permitted, whether one is calling on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or on any other created being, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… so invoke not anyone along with Allaah.” [al-Junn 72:18] “And whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allaah, any other god of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al-kaafiroon (the disbelievers) will not be successful.” [al-Mu’minoon 23:117] (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 3/4) The Muslim should follow, not innovate. He should believe in Allaah alone, call on Him alone and seek His help alone. He should not call on or seek the help of anyone else. The consequences of shirk are devastating, as it will wipe out all a person’s good deeds and lead to his doom in Hell. Bid’ah is a serious matter, which will cause a person’s deeds to be thrown back at him, not accepted. The Muslim should love, respect, honour and obey the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and give his words precedence over the words of any other human being, but it is not permitted to exaggerate about him, or to raise his status above that which has been bestowed upon him by Allaah, or to call on him instead of Allaah, because this is a violation of the rights of Allaah, and involves directing acts of worship to someone other than Allaah, when they should only be directed towards Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. We ask Allaah to help us to do that which will please Him and to avoid that which will earn His wrath, and to help us to love Him and His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The meeting together, mixing, and intermingling of men and women in one place, the crowding of them together, and the revealing and exposure of women to men are prohibited by the Law of Islam (Shari'ah). These acts are prohibited because they are among the causes for fitnah (temptation or trial which implies evil consequences), the arousing of desires, and the committing of indecency and wrongdoing. Among the many proofs of prohibition of the meeting and mixing of men and women in the Qur’aan and Sunnah are: Verse No. 53 of Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates (Interpretation of the meaning); \"...for anything ye want, ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs...\" In explaining this Verse, Ibn Kathir (May Allaah have mercy on him) said: \"Meaning, as I forbade you to enter their rooms, I forbid you to look at them at all. If one wants to take something from them, one should do so without looking at them. If one wants to ask a woman for something, the same has to be done from behind a screen.\" The Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) enforced separation of men and women even at Allaah’s most revered and preferred place, the mosque. This was accomplished via the separation of the women’s rows from the men’s; men were asked to stay in the mosque after completion of the obligatory prayer so that women will have enough time to leave the mosque; and, a special door was assigned to women. Evidence of the foregoing are: Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) said that after Allah’s Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) said \"as-Salamu ‘Alaykum wa Rahmatullah’ twice announcing the end of prayer, women would stand up and leave. He would stay for a while before leaving. Ibn Shihab said that he thought that the staying of the Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) was in order for the women to be able to leave before the men who wanted to depart.\" Narrated by al-Bukhari under No. 793. Abu Dawood under No. 876 narrates the same hadith in Kitab al-Salaat under the title \"Insiraaf an-Nisaa’ Qabl al-Rijaal min al-Salaah\" (Departure of Women before Men after the Prayer). Ibn ‘Umar said that Allah’s Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"We should leave this door (of the mosque) for women.\" Naafi’ said: \"Ibn ‘Umar never again entered through that door until he died.\" Narrated by Abu Dawood under No. 484 in \"Kitab as-Salah\" under the Chapter entitled: \"at-Tashdid fi Thalik\". Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) said: \"\"The best of the men’s rows is the first and the worst is the last, and the best of the women’s rows is the last and the worst in the first.\" Narrated by Muslim under No. 664. This is the greatest evidence that the Law of Islam (Shari'ah) forbids meeting and mixing of men and women. The farther the men are from the women’s rows, the better, and vice versa. If these procedures and precautions were prescribed and adhered to in a mosque, which is a pure place of worship where people are as far away as they ever are from the arousal of desire and temptation, then no doubt the same procedures need to be followed even more rigorously at other places. Abu Usayd al-Ansari narrated that he heard Allah’s Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) say to the women on his way out of the mosque when he saw men and women mixing together on their way home: ‘Give way (i.e., walk to the sides) as it is not appropriate for you to walk in the middle the road.’ Thereafter, women would walk so close to the wall that their dresses would get caught on it. Narrated by Abu Dawood in \"Kitab al-Adab min Sunanihi, Chapter: Mashyu an-Nisa Ma’ ar-Rijal fi at-Tariq.\"We know that the intermingling, mixing and crowding together of men and women is part of today’s unavoidable yet regrettable affliction in most places, such as markets, hospitals, colleges, etc., but: · We will not willfully choose or accept mixing and crowding, particularly in religious classes and council meetings in Islamic Centers. · We take precautions to avoid meeting and mixing of men and women as much as possible while at the same time achieving desired goals and objectives. This result can be achieved by designating separate places assigned for men and women, using different doors for each, utilizing modern means of communication such as microphones, video recorders etc., and expediting efforts to have enough female teachers to teach women, etc. · We show fear of Allaah as much as we can by not looking at members of the opposite sex and by applying self-restraint. There follow some of the results of a study on mixing undertaken by some Muslim social science researchers. When we put the following question: What is the Islamic ruling on mixing as far as you know? The results were as follows: 76% of respondents said “It is not permitted.” 12% said, “It is permitted” – but moral, religious, etc. restrictions apply… 12% said, “I don’t know.” Which would you choose? If you had the choice between working in a mixed workplace and working in another where there was no mixing, which would you choose? The responses to this question were as follows: 76% would choose the workplace where there was no mixing. 9% preferred the mixed workplace. 15% would accept any workplace which suited their specialties, regardless of whether it was mixed or not. Very embarrassing Have any embarrassing situations ever happened to you because of mixing? Among the embarrassing moments mentioned by respondents in this study were the following: I was at work one day, and I went into one department where one of my female colleagues who wears hijaab had taken off her hijaab in front of her female colleagues. My entrance took her by surprise and I was very embarrassed as a result. I had to do an experiment in the lab at university, but I was absent on the day of the experiment. I had to go to the lab on the following day, and I found myself the only male among a group of female students, in addition to a female teacher and a female lab technician. I was very embarrassed and felt very awkward with all those female eyes glaring at me. I was trying to take a feminine towel out of one of the drawers when I was surprised by a male colleague standing behind me, who wanted to take something from his own private drawer. He noticed that I was embarrassed and he left the room quickly to avoid my embarrassment. It so happened that one of the girls at the university bumped into me when turning a corner in a crowded corridor. She was walking quickly, going to one of the lectures. As a result of this collision, she lost her balance, and I caught her in my arms, as if I was embracing her. You can imagine how embarrassed I and this girl felt in front of a group of careless young people. One of my female colleagues fell on the stairs in the university and her clothes fell open in an extremely embarrassing fashion. She landed upside down and could not help herself; the young men standing nearby had no option but to cover her and help her to get up. I work in a company and I went in to give some papers to my boss. When I was going out, my boss called me back. I turned around and saw him with his face turned away. I was waiting for him to ask me for a file or for more papers, and I was surprised by his hesitancy. I turned away to the left side of his office, pretending to be busy with something, and he spoke to me at the same time. I thought that this boss would say anything except what he actually said, which was to point out that my garment was stained with menstrual blood. Can the earth open up and swallow a human being at the moment of making sincere supplication? For I prayed that the earth would open up and swallow me. Victims of mixing… True stories Lost hope Umm Muhammad, a mature woman over the age of 40, tells her story. I lived a life of modest means with my husband. There was never any closeness and harmony, and my husband did not have the kind of strong personality that a woman would hope for, but his good nature made me overlook the fact that I was the one who was responsible for most of the decision making in the family. My husband often used to mention the name of his friend and business partner, and he would talk about him in my presence, and I often used to meet with him in his office which was originally part of our apartment. This went on for many years, until circumstances led to us exchanging visits with this person and his family. These family visits were repeated and because of his close friendship with my husband, we did not notice how the number of visits increased and how many hours a single visit would last. He often used to come on his own to sit with us, me and my husband, for long visits. My husband’s trust in him knew no bounds, and as days passed I got to know this person very well, and saw how wonderful and decent he was. I began to feel a strong attraction towards this man, and at the same time I began to sense that the feeling was mutual. Things took a strange turn after that, when I realized that this man was the kind of person I had always dreamed about. Why had he come along now, after all these years? The more this man’s status increased in my eyes, the more my husband’s status diminished. It was as if I had needed to see the beauty of his character in order to discover how ugly my husband’s character was. The matter between this person and myself did not go beyond these persistent thoughts which were occupying my mind night and day. Neither he nor I ever voiced what we felt in our hearts… until today. Yet despite that my life is over and my husband is little more than a weak man with no self-esteem. I hate him and I do not know how all this hatred towards him started to boil over. I wonder how I put up with him all these years, bearing all these burdens by myself, facing life’s problems on my own. Things got so bad that I asked him for a divorce, and he divorced me at my request. After that he became a broken man. Even worse than that is that after my marriage was wrecked and my children and husband were devastated, problems arose in this man's family. His wife, with her feminine intuition, realized what had been going on in his heart of hearts, and his life became hell. She was overwhelmed with jealousy to the extent that one night she left her house at 2 a.m. and came to attack my house, screaming, weeping and hurling accusations. His marriage was also about to collapse. I admit that the lovely gatherings which we used to enjoy gave us the opportunity to get to know one another at a time that was not appropriate at this stage in our lives. His marriage has been wrecked and so has mine. I have lost everything, and now I know that my circumstances and his will not permit us to take any positive step towards coming together. Now I am more miserable than I have ever been, and I am looking for illusionary happiness and lost hopes. Tit-for-tat Umm Ahmad tells us: My husband had a group of married friends, and because of our close friendship with them, we used to get together with them once a week in one of our houses, to enjoy an evening of chat. Deep down in my heart I was never really comfortable with the atmosphere in which we would have dinner, sweets, snacks and drinks of juice accompanied by waves of laughter because of the jokes and chit-chats that often went beyond the bounds of good manners. In the name of friendship, the barriers were lifted and every now and then one would hear suppressed laughter between a woman and the husband of another woman. The jokes were too much, dealing – with no sense of shyness –with sensitive topics such as sex and women’s private matters. This was usual and was even accepted and regarded as desirable. Although I indulged in these things along with them, my conscience made me feel guilty. Then the day came when it became quite clear just how ugly and filthy this atmosphere was. The telephone rang, and I heard the voice of one of the friends in this group. I said hello to him and apologized that my husband was not home. He replied that he knew that, and that he was calling to speak to me! After he suggested starting a relationship with me, I got very angry and spoke harshly to him and cursed him. All he could do was laugh and say, “Don’t try and show these good manners to me; go and check on your husband’s good manners and see what he is doing…” I was devastated by what he said, but I pulled myself together and said to myself, this person is only trying to cause the break up of your marriage. But he succeeded in planting the seeds of doubt concerning my husband. Shortly after that, the major disaster struck. I discovered that my husband was cheating on me with another woman. It was the matter of life or death as far as I was concerned. I found my husband out and I confronted him, saying: “You are not the only one who can have a relationship. I have received a similar proposition.” And I told him all about his friend. He was stunned and absolutely shocked. (I said:) “If you want me to respond in kind to your relationship with that woman, then this is for that, tit-for-tat.” This was a huge slap in the face for him. He knew that I did not intend to do that in reality, but he realized the great disaster that had befallen our lives and the immoral atmosphere in which we were living. I suffered a great deal until my husband finally left that loose woman with whom he was having a relationship, as he admitted to me. Yes, he left her and came back to his family and children, but how can I ever feel the same towards him as I used to? Who will restore respect for him in my heart? This huge wound in my heart is still bleeding out of regret and rage at that filthy atmosphere; it still bears testimony to the fact that what they call innocent get-togethers are in reality anything but innocent. My heart still begs for mercy from the Lord of Glory. Intelligence can also be a temptation (fitnah) ‘Abd al-Fattaah says: I work as the head of department in one of the big companies. For a long time I admired one of my female colleagues, not for her beauty, but for her serious attitude towards her work, her intelligence and her excellent achievements – in addition to the fact that she was a decent and modest person who focused only on her work. This admiration turned into attachment, and I am a married man who fears Allaah and never misses any obligatory prayer. I expressed my feelings to her and she rebuffed me. She is married and has children as well. She sees no reason why I should have any kind of relationship with her, whether it be friendship, as work colleagues or based on admiration… etc. Evil thoughts come to me sometimes, and deep down I wish that her husband would divorce her so that I could get her. I started to put pressure on her at work and put her down in front of my bosses. Perhaps this was a form of revenge on my part, but she accepted it with good manners and did not complain or comment. She works and works; her performance speaks of her quality, and she knows this well. The more she resisted me, the stronger my infatuation grew. I am not a person who is easily tempted by women, because I fear Allaah and I do not overstep the mark with them and go beyond what is required by my work. But this woman attracted me. What is the solution?… I do not know. Baby ducks know how to swim N.A.A., a nineteen-year-old girl, tells us: At that time I was a little girl. My innocent eyes watched those evening get-togethers when family friends would meet in the house. What I remember is that I could only see one man, who was my father. I watched him as he moved about the room, how his glances would devour the women present, looking at their thighs and chests, admiring this one’s eyes, that one’s hair, the other’s hips. My poor mother had no choice but to take care of these get-togethers. She was a very simple lady. Among the women present there was one woman who would deliberately try to attract my father’s attention, sometimes by coming close to him, and sometimes by making enticing movements. I would watch this with concern, whilst my mother was busy in the kitchen for the sake of her guests. These gatherings stopped suddenly and I tried, young as I was, to understand and make sense of what had happened, but I could not. What I remember was that my mother collapsed completely at that time, and she could not stand to hear my father’s name mentioned in the house. I used to hear mysterious words whispered by the adults around me: “Betrayal… bedroom… she saw them with her own eyes… despicable woman… in a very shameful position…” etc. These were the key words which only the adults could understand. I grew up and came to understand, and I bore a grudge against all men. All of them were treacherous. My mother was a broken woman and accused every woman who came to us of being a man-snatcher who wanted to make my father fall into her trap. My father hasn’t changed. He is still practising his favourite hobby of chasing women, but now he does it outside the home. Now I am nineteen years old and I know lots of young men. I feel great pleasure in taking revenge on them, because every one of them is an exact copy of my father. I tempt them and entice them, without letting them get anywhere near me. They follow me in gatherings and in the marketplaces because of my movements and deliberate gestures. Sometimes my phone never stops ringing and I feel proud of what I do to avenge the sex of Hawwa’ and my mother. But sometimes I feel so miserable and such a failure that it almost chokes me. My life is shadowed by a huge dark cloud, and its name is my father. Before it is too late S.N.A. tells of her experience: I never imagined that my work circumstances would force me to be in contact with the opposite sex (men), but this in fact is what happened… In the beginning, I used to cover and screen myself from men by wearing niqaab (face-veil), but some of the sisters advised me that this dress was attracting more attention to my presence, and it would be better for me to take off the niqaab, especially since my eyes were somewhat attractive. So I removed the cover from my face, thinking that this was better. But by continuing to mix with my colleagues, I discovered that I was the odd one out because of my antisocial attitude and my insistence on not joining in the conversation and chatting with others. Everyone was wary of this “lone-wolf” woman (as they saw me), and this is what was stated clearly by one person who affirmed that he would not want to deal with such a snooty and stand-offish character. But I knew that I was the opposite, in fact, and I decided that I would not oppress myself and put myself in a difficult position with my colleagues. So I started to join in their chats and exchanges of anecdotes, and they all discovered that I could speak eloquently and persuasively, and that I could influence others. I could also speak in a manner that was determined yet at the same time was attractive to some of my colleagues. It was not long before I noticed some changes in the expression of my direct supervisor; with some embarrassment, he was enjoying the way I spoke and moved, and he would deliberately bring up topics in the conversation where I would see that hateful look in his eyes. I do not deny the fact that I started to entertain some thoughts about this man. I found it astonishing that a man could fall so easily into the trap of a woman who was religiously committed, so how must it be in the case of women who adorn themselves and invite men to commit immoral actions? In fact, I did not think of him in any way which went beyond the bounds of sharee’ah, but he did occupy a space in my thoughts for quite some time. But soon my self-respect made me reject the idea of being a source of enjoyment for this man in any way, shape or form, even if it was only psychological in nature, and I stopped getting involved in any kind of work that would force me to sit alone with him. In the end, I reached the following conclusions: 1- Attraction between the sexes can occur in any circumstances, no matter how much men and women may deny that. The attraction may start within the bounds of sharee’ah and end up going beyond those bounds. Even if a person protects himself (by marriage), he is not safe from the snares of the Shaytaan. 3- Even though a person may be able to guarantee himself and he works with the opposite sex within reasonable limits, he cannot guarantee the feelings of the other party. Finally, there is nothing good in mixing and it does not bear fruit as they claim. On the contrary, it corrupts sound thinking. What now? We may ask, what comes next, after this discussion on the matter of mixing? It’s about time for us to recognize that no matter how we try to beautify the issue of mixing and take the matter lightly, its consequences are bound to catch up with us, and the harm it causes will have disastrous results for our families. Sound common sense refuses to accept that mixing is a healthy atmosphere for human relations. This is the sound common sense which made most of the people included in this survey (76%) prefer working in a non-mixed environment. The same percentage (76%) said that mixing is not permitted according to the sharee’ah. What makes us sit up and take notice is not this honourable percentage – which indicates the purity of our Islamic society and the cleanness of its members’ hearts – but the small number who said that mixing is permitted; they number 12%. This group, with no exceptions, said that mixing is permitted but within the limits set by religion, custom (‘urf), traditions, good manners, conscience, modesty, covering and other worthy values which, in their opinion, keep mixing within proper limits. We ask them: is the mixing which we see nowadays in our universities, market-places, work-places and family and social gatherings, taking place within the limits referred to above? Or are these places filled with transgressions in terms of clothing, speech, interactions and behaviour? We see wanton displays of adornment (tabarruj), not proper covering; we see fitnah (temptations) and dubious relationships, with no good manners and no conscience and no covering. We can conclude that the kind of mixing that is happening nowadays is unacceptable even to those who approve of mixing in a clean atmosphere. It’s about time for us to recognize that mixing provides a fertile breeding-ground for social poisons to invade and take over our society without anyone ever realizing that it is mixing which is the cause. Mixing is the prime element in this silent fitnah, in the shade of which betrayals erupt, homes are wrecked and hearts are broken. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound, and to reform our society. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the correct opinion which must be acted upon is that indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.” That is the basis for determining the beginning and end of Ramadaan by the actual sighting of the new moon. The Islamic sharee’ah with which Allaah sent our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is universal and everlasting, until the Day of Resurrection. (It is valid for every time and place, whether worldly sciences are advanced or otherwise, whether there are telescopes etc. or not, whether there are any people in the population who are able to do astronomical calculations or not. Sighting the moon is something that people of all places and times can do, unlike calculations which may or may not be within the reach of the people, and telescopes which may or may not be available) Secondly: Allaah knew what progress would be made in astronomy and other sciences, but despite that He still said (interpretation of the meaning): “… So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185] and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it…” So the beginning and ending of Ramadaan are connected to the actual sighting of the moon, and not to the calculations of astronomers, even though Allaah knew that the astronomers would develop their science to the point where they would be able to calculate the positions of the stars and heavenly bodies. The Muslims are obliged to follow what Allaah has prescribed for them through His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), basing the beginning and end of the fast on the sighting of the moon. This is like the consensus of the scholars, whoever differs with this and relies on calculations is shaadhdh (“odd”) and his opinion cannot be relied on. And Allaah knows best.\n",

Hence when Allaah stated that the ribaa which the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to charge when the debtor delayed payment, when they would charge the debtor more in return for a respite, was forbidden, He commanded that the debtor should be given a respite without further charges being made. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “And if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know” [al-Baqarah 2:280] And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There are two aspects to the answer to this question: general and specific. The general answer is that the Muslim believes that Allaah is All-Wise and All-Knowing, and He does not create anything in vain; all of His actions are based on Wisdom. If the wisdom behind any of His actions is hidden from the believer, then he should still adhere to this principle, and not think of his Lord in bad terms. The specific answer is that the wisdom behind the creation of these things is to manifest the perfect nature of Allaah’s creation and control of all things. Even though the created things are so many, He provides for them all. He also tests people by means of these (dangerous creatures), rewards those who are afflicted by them and makes manifest the bravery of those who kill them. By creating them, He tests His slaves’ faith and certainty: the believer accepts the matter and submits, whilst the doubter says, “What is the point of Allaah creating this?!” He also demonstrates the weakness and incapability of man, whereby he suffers pain and sickness because of a creature which is far smaller than he is. One of the scholars was asked about the wisdom behind the creation of flies. He said, so that Allaah may humiliate the noses of the tyrants with them. Because of the existence of harmful creatures, it becomes apparent how great is the blessing in the creation of beneficial things, as it is said that contrast with the opposite demonstrates the nature of things. The study of medicine has demonstrated that many beneficial drugs are derived from the venom of snakes and the like. Glory be to the One Who has created benefits in things that to all outward appearances are harmful. Moreover, many of these dangerous animals are food for other creatures which are beneficial, and this forms the ecological cycle in the environments where Allaah has created them. But the Muslim has to believe that everything that Allaah does is good, and that there is no pure evil in what He creates. In everything that He creates there has to be some aspect of good, even if it is hidden from us, as is the case with the creation of Iblees, who is the head of evil. But there is wisdom and a purpose behind his creation, for Allaah tests His creatures by means of him, to distinguish the obedient from the disobedient, those who strive from those who are negligent, the people of Paradise from the people of Hell. We ask Allaah to bless us with strength of faith and understanding of our religion. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is part of the justice of Allaah that He does not punish any people until He has first sent a warning to them and unless there is evidence against them. Allaah does not treat anybody unfairly. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning). [al-Israa 17:15]. In his tafseer (commentary) on this aayah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: These words, And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning) tell us of the justice of Allaah, may He be exalted, and that He does not punish anyone until after He has established evidence against him by sending a Messenger to him. This is like the aayat (interpretation of the meaning): Every time a group is cast therein [into Hell], its keeper will ask, Did no warner come to you? They will say, Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we belied him and said: Allaah never sent down anything (of revelation), you are only in great error. [al-Mulk 67:8] and: And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened (suddenly like a prison at the arrival of its prisoners). And its keepers will say, Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the Verses of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of this Day of yours? They will say: Yes, but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers! [al-Zumar 39:71] A person who has never heard of Islam or the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and who has never heard the message in its correct and true form, will not be punished by Allaah if he dies in a state of kufr (disbelief). If it were asked what his fate will be, the answer will be that Allaah will test him on the Day of Resurrection: if he obeys, he will enter Paradise and if he disobeys he will enter Hell. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth of al-Aswad ibn Saree, who reported that the Prophet of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There are four (who will protest) to Allaah on the Day of Resurrection: the deaf man who never heard anything, the insane man, the very old man, and the man who died during the fatrah (the interval between the time of Eesaa (Jesus, upon whom be peace) and the time of Muhammad SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). The deaf man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I never heard anything. The insane man will say, O Lord, Islam came but the children ran after me and threw stones at me. The very old man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I did not understand anything. The man who died during the fatrah will say, O Lord, no Messenger from You came to me. He will accept their promises of obedience, then word will be sent to them to enter the Fire. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, if they enter it, it will be cool and safe for them. According to another report, he said: Whoever enters it, it will be cool and safe for him, and whoever does not enter it will be dragged to it. (The hadeeth was reported by Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Hibbaan, and deemed saheeh by al-Albaani, Saheeh al-Jaami, 881). Everyone who hears the message of Islam in a sound and correct form (and rejects it), will have evidence aginst him. Whoever dies without having heard the message, or having heard it in a distorted form, then his case is in the hands of Allaah. Allaah knows best about His creation, and He will never treat anyone unfairly. And Allaah is All-Seer of His slaves.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to use telescopes etc. to sight the moon, but it is not permissible to rely on astronomical data to confirm the beginning or end of the blessed month of Ramadaan, because Allaah has not prescribed that for us in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What He has prescribed for us is to confirm the beginning and end of Ramadaan by sighting the new moon of Ramadaan to start fasting, and the new moon of Shawwaal to end the fast and gather to offer the Eid prayers. Allaah has made the new moons to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj, so it is not permissible for Muslims to use any other method to determine the times for acts of worship such as fasting, celebrating Eid, performing Hajj, fasting for two months as expiation (kafaarah) for killing someone by mistake or divorcing one’s wife by zihaar, and so on. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “… So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185] “They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage…” [al-Baqarah 2:189] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.” On this basis, the one who does not see the new moon from the time it rises on a clear or cloudy night must complete the month (of Sha’baan) with thirty days. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/100). This is the case if the sighting of the new moon is not confirmed in another country; if the moon is sighted according to the guidelines of Sharee’ah, then fasting is obligatory, according to the majority of scholars. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the fact that the moon rises at different times in different places is a well-established fact; no scholar disputes this. However, the scholars differ as to whether this matters or not. Secondly: the question as to whether different times of moonrise is something that matters is a theoretical question in which ijtihaad is permissible. Those who have knowledge of science and religion differ on this matter, and this difference of opinion is permissible; the one who has the correct opinion will have two rewards, one for being right and one for making ijtihaad; the one whose opinion is wrong will still be rewarded for his ijtihaad. The scholars’ differences on this matter may be described as one of two: some of them thought that the differences in the times of the moon’s rising was of significance, and others thought that it was not. Both groups cite evidence from the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and maybe even quote the same text, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage…” [al-Baqarah 2:189] and the hadeeth, “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it…” The difference is one of interpretation of the texts, as each group has its own methods of deriving evidence. Thirdly: the committee has looked at the issue of confirming the new moon by calculations and what was said on this matter in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, and they have studied the opinions of the scholars on this matter. They decided unanimously that astronomical calculations do not count when it comes to confirming the new moon for shar'i purposes, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it…” and also: “Do not fast until you see it [the new moon] and do not stop fasting until you see it…”, and because of the evidence that is derived from these ahaadeeth. The Standing Committee on Scientific Research and Fatwas (al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa’) thinks that the Muslim students’ union (or any other group representing the Muslim community) in countries where the government is not Islamic should take the place of an Islamic government in the matter of confirming the new moon for the people living in those non-Islamic countries. On the basis of the above, this union has the choice of two options: either to consider the differences in times of moonrise to be of significance, or not to do so. Then they should inform all the Muslims in their country what their opinion is, and the Muslims have to follow what they have been told, so as to unite the Muslims in their fasting and to put an end to disputes and confusion. Everyone who lives in those countries should try to sight the moon in the place where they are living, and if one or more trustworthy persons sight the moon, they should fast according to that and tell the union to spread the news. This is at the beginning of Ramadaan; at the end of the month there has to be two witnesses to see the new moon of Shawwaal or the completion of thirty days of Ramadaan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.” And Allaah knows best.\n",

Among these ahaadeeth are the following: 1. Abu Saeed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"At the end of the time of my ummah, the Mahdi will appear. Allaah will grant him rain, the earth will bring forth its fruits, he will give a lot of money, cattle will increase and the ummah will become great. He will rule for seven or eight years. (Mustadrak al-Haakim, 4/557-558; he said: this is a hadeeth whose isnaad is saheeh, although it was not reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, and al-Albaani said: this is a saheeh sanad, and its men are thiqaat (trustworthy), Silsilat al-ahaadeeth al-saheehah, vol. 2, p. 336, hadeeth 771) 2. Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: The Mahdi is one of us, a member of my family. Allaah will guide him in a single night.\" (Musnad Ahmad, 2/58, hadeeth 645, edited by Ahmad al-Shaakir, who said: its isnaad is saheeh; Sunan Ibn Maajah, 2/1367. This hadeeth was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami al-Sagheer, 6735). Ibn Katheer said: \"This means that Allaah will forgive him, grant him help, inspire him and guide him, when he was not like this before.\" (Al-Nihaayah, al-Fitan wal-Malaahim, 1/29; edited by Taha Zayni). 3. Abu Saeed al-Khudri said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: The Mahdi is of my lineage, with a high forehead and a long, thin, curved nose. He will fill the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled with oppression and injustice, and he will rule for seven years.\" (Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Mahdi, 11/375, hadeeth 4265; Mustadrak al-Haakim, 4/557; he said: this is a saheeh hadeeth according to the conditions of Muslim, although it was not reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. See also Saheeh al-Jaami, 6736). 4. Umm Salamah said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) say: The Mahdi is of my lineage and family, from the descendants of Faatimah.\" (Sunan Abu Dawud, 11/373; Sunan Ibn Maajah. 2/1368. Al-Albaani said that it is saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami, 6734) 5. Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend, and their leader the Mahdi will say, \"Come and lead us in prayer,\" but he will say, \"No, one of them should lead them as an honour to this ummah from Allaah.\"\" The version narrated by Muslim says: \" Then Eesaa ibn Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend and their leader will say, Come and lead us in prayer, but he will say, No, some of you are leaders over others as an honour from Allaah to this ummah.\" (Reported by Muslim, 225) 6. Abu Saeed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"He is one of us, behind whom Eesaa ibn Maryam will pray.\" (Reported by Abi Naeem in Akhbaar al-Mahdi. Al-Albaani said it is saheeh; see al-Jaami al-Sagheer, 5/219, hadeeth 5796). 7. Abdullaah ibn Masood reported that the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"The world will not come to an end until the Arabs are ruled by a man from my family whose name will be the same as mine.\" (Musnad Ahmad, 5/199, hadeeth 3573. Another version says: \" whose name is the same as mine and whose fathers name is the same as my fathers.\" Sunan Abi Dawud, 11/370). The ahaadeeth concerning the appearance of the Mahdi reach the level of Tawaatur in meaning (tawaatur refers to a hadeeth which was narrated by so many people through so many isnaads that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). The imaams and scholars of this ummah have stated this, and a few of their comments are quoted below: 1. Al-Haafiz Abul-Hasan al-Aabiri said: \"The mutawaatir reports from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) describing the Mahdi are very many. They state that the Mahdi will be of his family, that he will rule for seven years, that he will fill the earth with justice, that Eesaa ibn Maryam will emerge and help him to kill the Dajjaal, and that he will lead this ummah in prayer and Eesaa will pray behind him.\" 2. Muhammad al-Barzanji said, in his book al-Ishaaah li Ashraat al-Saaah: \"The major signs and the signs that will be immediately followed by the Hour: these signs are many, of which the Mahdi will be the first. Know that the ahaadeeth that have been narrated about him in various reports are numerous.\" He also said: \"You know that the ahaadeeth which speak of the Mahdi, his appearance at the end of time, and his lineage and descent from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) via Faatimah reach the level of tawaatur in meaning, so there is no point in denying them.\" 3. Al-Allaamah Muhammad al-Safaareeni said: \"There are so many reports which speak of the appearance of the Mahdi that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning; they are very popular among the scholars of Sunnah and have become part of their faith.\" Then he quotes a number of ahaadeeth and reports about the appearance of the Mahdi and the names of the Sahaabah from whom they were narrated: \"Many reports were narrated from the Sahaabah whose names were mentioned and others whose names were not mentioned, may Allaah be pleased with them all, and from the Taabieen after them, all of which proves that this is definitive knowledge. Belief in the appearance of the Mahdi is obligatory, as it has been confirmed by the scholars and is listed among the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah.\" 4. Al-Allaamah al-Mujtahid al-Shawkaani said: \"The ahaadeeth that we have come across that speak of the awaited Mahdi reach the level of tawaatur, including fifty saheeh, hasan and daeef munjabar ahaadeeth. There are mutawaatir without a doubt; indeed they are more mutawaatir than others, according to all the standards of usool. There are also many reports from the Sahaabah that speak about the Mahdi and that reach the level of marfoo, so there is no room for individual opinions in such an issue.\" 5. Al-Allaamah al-Shaykh Siddeeq Hasan Khaan said: \"Even though there are different versions of reports concerning the Mahdi, they are so many that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning. They are to be found in al-Sunan and other books of Islam.\" 6. Al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Jafar al-Kattaani said: \"The conclusion is that the ahaadeeth narrated concerning the Mahdi are mutawaatir, as are the ahaadeeth concerning the Dajjaal and the descent of Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace.\" (See Ashraat al-Saaah by Yoosuf ibn Abdullaah al-Waabil, pp. 195-203). You should be aware that some liars have fabricated ahaadeeth about the Mahdi, and others have even claimed to be he, or that he belongs to a group other than Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah. Some of these \"false mahdis\" have tried to deceive the slaves of Allaah for some worldly gain and to distort the picture of Islaam. Some have started movements and revolutions and gathered those people and supporters whom they were able to deceive. Then they were destroyed, and their lies and falsehood were exposed. None of this affects the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah in the Mahdi, upon whom be peace, and that he will undoubtedly appear and rule the earth in accordance with Islamic Shareeah.

If you cannot find anyone but this man who can recite well, then let him lead the prayers, but keep advising him.

Are we permitted to pray behind him or not? He answered: If this man who shaves his beard is the official permanent imaam in a mosque, you should try to replace him with someone better, and look for someone who is righteous and qualified, and free of this sin, who could be appointed as the imaam. If he is an imaam who always leads the prayers in an office or school, leading zuhr prayers during work hours, then first of all you should advise him of how abhorrent his action is. If he then persists, then try to find someone else who does not have this fault, even if he is less skilled in recitation.

It is prescribed for sick people not to fast in Ramadan, if fasting will cause harm or make the sickness worse, or if they need treatment during the day in the form of medicine or pills that must be swallowed. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days” [al-Baqarah 2:185] Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah loves people to avail themselves of His concessions (rukhsah) just as He hates them to commit sin.” According to another version, “As He loves His commands to be obeyed.” Can we check sugar during fasting? With regard to taking blood from veins for testing etc., the correct view is that this does not break the fast, but if it is done often, it is better to leave it until night-time. If it is done during the day then to be on the safe side that day should be made up, because this is akin to cupping.” (Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), from Fatawa Islamiyyah, vol. 2, p. 139) Can diabetics fast? Sickness is of various kinds: That which does not affect the fast, such as a light cold or mild headache or toothache, and the like. In this case it is not permissible to break the fast, even though some of the scholars permitted that because of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “and whoever is ill…”[al-Baqarah 2:185] But we say that this ruling is based on a reason, which is that not fasting is easier. If that is the case, then we would say that not fasting is better, but if fasting does not have an effect on him then it is not permissible to break the fast, and he has to fast. If fasting is difficult for the sick person, but it does not harm him, then it is makruh for him to fast and it is Sunnah for him to break his fast. If fasting is difficult for him and will cause him harm , such as a man who has kidney disease or diabetes and similar cases where fasting will cause harm. In this case fasting is haram. Hence we may see that some mujtahids and sick people make a mistake when fasting is difficult for them and may harm them, but they refuse to break their fast. We say that they are mistaken because they refuse to accept the kindness of Allah and the concession that He has given to them, and they are harming themselves, although Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And do not kill yourselves”[al-Nisa 4:29] (Al-Sharh al-Mumti’ by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, vol. 6, 352-254) And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. What is well-known is that the scholars say that everything that is discharged from the front and back passages is naajis (impure) except for one thing, semen, which is taahir (pure); apart from that everything else that has substance is naajis and breaks one’s wudoo’. On this basis, whatever fluid comes out of a woman is naajis and requires her to renew her wudoo’. This is what I understand after researching the issue with some scholars and consulting reference material. However, I did not feel entirely comfortable about this issue, because some women always have this discharge; if this is the case, then she should handle it as incontinence is handled: if she has wudoo’ she should wash her private parts when the time for prayer comes, and be careful not to let the urine contaminate her. This is similar to the advice that the Prophet gave to the woman suffering from istihaadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding). Having also discussed the matter with some doctors, it is clear that if the discharge is from the bladder, the woman should do as described above; if it is from the vagina then she must perform wudoo’ because of it, but the discharge is taahir and she does not have to wash her clothes if it gets on them.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There are jaahili customs, or reprehensible innovations, and you have to give them up and explain to others that they are wrong. With regard to reciting Qur’aan over the grave of the deceased, this is not permissible, and none of the Salaf did this. If it were good to do this, they would have done it before us. It has been reported that Soorat Yaa-Seen should be recited for the person who is dying, before his soul departs, but after he has died and when he is being buried and after the burial, there is nothing that should be recited, and one should not tell him to say “Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah” and so on. Offering condolences is Sunnah, but it need not be during the mourning ceremonies. Condolences may be offered to the family of the deceased in all places. There is nothing wrong with all the relatives of the deceased gathering together in one place so that people may come and offer their condolences, but they should not gather for the purpose of eating. Food should be prepared only for the immediate family of the deceased; it is makrooh for them to offer food to others. There is no need to gather this money from everyone, unless the family are poor, in which case they may be given zakaat funds. It is not permissible to slaughter this sheep, whether it is from the wealth of the deceased or from someone else. But if food is prepared for the family of the deceased, from one or more animals, there is nothing wrong with this. Collecting these pebbles, and making dhikr whilst doing so, and putting them on the grave – this is a reprehensible innovation (bid’ah) which must be given up and denounced. Raising one’s voice in wailing and lamenting, striking the cheeks and eulogizing the deceased are all bid’ah and actions of the jaahiliyyah. It was reported in a hadeeth: “He is not one of us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and calls with the call of the jaahiliyyah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1294, Fath 3/163; Muslim, 103; Ahmad, 1/244). Wearing black as a sign of mourning for the deceased is bid’ah; but the wives of the deceased should avoid wearing fancy or adorned clothes, jewellery, makeup and perfume during their period of mourning. It is bid’ah for women to avoid their usual work and activities; the newly-widowed woman can still prepare food, clean the house, wash the dishes, do laundry, etc. There is nothing wrong with her doing that.

But if he does not pay zakaah because he is stingy, but he believes that it is obligatory, then he is a sinner who is guilty of a major sin and he is a wrong doer, but he is not a kaafir.

      "Related Praise be to Allah.We need to talk at length about the issue of perfumes that are said to contain cologne or alcohol . If the percentage of alcohol in perfume is very little, we say that it does not matter, and a person may use them without any concern, such as if the alcohol content is 5% or less. This does not matter. If the percentage of alcohol in perfume is very high, so that you can detect it, then it is better not to use it except where it is necessary, such as for sterilizing wounds and the like. In cases where it is not necessary, it is better not to use it, but we do not say that it is haram. The most we can say is that this high alcohol content is an intoxicant, and no doubt consuming intoxicants is haram according to the texts of Islam and the consensus of the scholars, but is using it in ways other than drinking it permissible? This is open to speculation, but to be on the safe side we should not use it. If you say that it is open to speculation because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansab [animals that are sacrificed on stone altars for idols], and al-azlam [arrows for seeking luck or decision], are an abomination of Shaytan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from al-salah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain?” [al-Maidah 5:90-91], then we look at the general meaning of the phrase ‘So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination), and say that alcohol should be avoided in all cases, whether it is drunk or applied to the skin, or used in some other way. If we look at the reason why, Allah says, “Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer. So will you not then abstain?” We may understand this to mean that only drinking it is forbidden , because applying it to the skin does not lead to that (enmity and hatred, etc.). So, in conclusion, we say that if the percentage of alcohol in this perfume is low, there is no need to worry about using it, but if it is high, then it is better to avoid it unless it is for a need, such as sterilizing wounds and the like.

      "Praise be to Allah.Reciting in a melodious voice (taghanni) may mean: 1 – Making the voice beautiful when reciting, whilst reciting aloud in a tone that conveys the feelings of humility, softening of the heart and sadness, without making too much effort or exaggerating. Taghanni means reciting aloud, as it was narrated in Saheeh Muslim that Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah does not listen to anything (more approvingly) than He listens to a Prophet reciting the Qur’aan aloud in a melodious voice…” This indicates that we are commanded and encouraged to make our voices beautiful when reciting Qur’aan. This hadeeth clearly states the meaning of taghanni. The phrase “reciting aloud” explains it. Reciting aloud means raising one’s voice when reciting and making it beautiful, in a natural manner with no artifice, which one enjoys and finds pleasure in. Before the Qur’aan was revealed, the Arabs used to sing hudaa’ (songs of camel drivers) when riding camels, to make the journey pass more quickly when they were sitting in their saddles, and so on. But when the Qur’aan was revealed, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to make them focus on the Qur’aan and raise their voices and make them beautiful when reciting it. He wanted that to take the place of singing, whilst paying attention to the correctness of the recitation. So in place of the pleasure of singing, they were given the pleasure of reciting Qur’aan, just as everything forbidden was replaced with something that was better for them. So istikhaarah was prescribed in place of seeking decisions from azlaam (arrows for divination) and marriage in place of fornication, and so on. 2 – It may be that what is meant by taghanni is that which resembles singing and music, and impressing others with the tune, without understanding and without any humility, as mentioned in the hadeeth which describes the Signs of the Hour. 3 – It is unlikely that taghanni means being content with the Qur’aan alone and having no need of people, because the meaning is different and is linguistically unacceptable. This making the voice melodious in recitation should be done in a natural manner, not by means of teaching and training according to the rules of music. Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned that reciting Qur’aan with a tune and in a melodious voice, if it is done naturally with no exaggeration or special teaching or training, then it is permissible. If extra effort is added to the natural tone to make it more beautiful, such as when Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari said to the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “If I had known (you were listening), I would have made it more beautiful for you,” then that is OK. But if the reciting in a melodious voice is done in an artificial manner, with special training and musical rhythms, this is something which the salaf despised, and which they criticized and condemned. It is known that the salaf used to recite the Qur’aan in a sad tone, making their voices beautiful and giving it a sad tone sometimes and a joyful tone sometimes. This is something natural. Defining the meaning of making the voice melodious (taghanni) (a)I say: there is no dispute concerning the validity of the fatwa of Imaam Maalik which is based on the hadeeth of the Signs of the Hour, with its various isnaads, and which states that it is not permitted to recite with a musical tune and following the rules of music in a manner that goes beyond the limits of recitation and correct pronunciation, and does not befit the dignity of the Qur’aan. (b)The ahaadeeth of Anas and Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) refer to the recitation of the Khawaarij, who used to recite the Qur’aan throughout the night and day, but it did not go any deeper than their throats or collar bones, because they did not have knowledge of the Sunnah which clarifies matters, so they were deprived of proper understanding and the reward for recitation. In the ahaadeeth it says that they would exit from the religion like an arrow passing through its target. The ahaadeeth contain the command to kill them and says that they are the most evil of creation, even though you would think that your prayer and your recitation are as nothing when compared with their prayer and recitation. This is the description of the Khawaarij and those who are like them. Ibn Taymiyah said: the hadeeth about the Khawaarij is saheeh in ten different isnaads, which were narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, and some of which were narrated by al-Bukhaari. The Khawaarij used to denounce the Muslims as kaafirs merely for committing sins, but they were the followers of bid’ah (innovations) and misinterpretations who had split away from the mainstream of the ummah. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in our religious commitment and their worldly affairs. This is a description which applies only to the Khawaarij and those who are like them. The reciters nowadays are not like this as far as we know. (c)The fatwa of Imaam Ahmad has to do with distorting the letters and exaggerating elongated vowels, which results from altering the letters and elongating them too much, which takes the recitation beyond what is correct. This fatwa states that it is emphatically disliked, as al-Qaadi Abu Ya’laa said. This refers to someone who goes to extremes and whose recitation is not correct, because he adds letters, such as adding waw and alif to the word Muhammad, making it Moohaamad. This is haraam, according to consensus. At the time of Imaam Ahmad, the people used to sing poetry and elongate the letters however they wished. Ishaaq al-Mawsili criticized Ibraaheem ibn al-Mahdi for doing that, because he distorted the words from the way they should be in Arabic. And denouncing that in the case of reciting Qur’aan in a melodious voice is more essential, and this problem does not exist nowadays, praise be to Allaah. (d)Ibn Taymiyah said: the kind of tune which the scholars regard as makrooh for reciting Qur’aan in is that which involves shortening long letters, lengthening short letters, giving a vowel to a silent letter, or making a vowelled letter silent, in order to make it fit the rules of music. If that also involves changing the way the Qur’aan should be recited and elongating the vowels, then this is haraam. Reconciling between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed There is no contradiction between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed if the prohibition applies to that which goes beyond the limits of correct recitation, whether by adding or taking away, or by neglecting an obligatory rule, or by going against the well-established rules of recitation. The prohibition also applies to that which is recited according to the rules of music, even if it is without the accompaniment of instruments, to make the voice tremble or quaver, or exaggerating in going along with a particular musical key which is in the reciter’s mind whilst he is reciting. The permission applies only to that which is in accordance with the rules of sound recitation whilst making the voice beautiful. If what is meant by giving a tune is adding or taking away anything, or going against the well-established rules of recitation, this is haraam. If I mean making the voice melodious in recitation (taghanni), in order to make the listener feel happy or sad, or to soften his heart or to make the recitation attractive whilst also pondering the meanings and reflecting humility, then it is mustahabb, so long as it does not distort the meaning or change the pronunciation, or follow the rules of music. Al-Suyooti said: Reciting Qur’aan with a tune and with beautiful, quavering voices, so long as it does not deviate from the correct way of reciting, is a good way (Sunnah hasanah); if it does deviate from the correct way of reciting, then it is haraam and is an evil deed. And he said in Sharh al-Risaalah: From the comments of the imams it may be understood that making the voice beautiful whilst paying attention to the rules of music and also following the rules of recitation is an area that is subject to scholarly dispute. Some of the scholars said that this is different from the way of the salaf, because the reader may neglect to recite properly, so they said that this was not permitted, in order to prevent the means that may lead to something haraam. But making the voice beautiful whilst reciting Qur’aan, without paying attention to the rules of music is what is required, and there is no dispute concerning this. Ibn Qudaamah said: the scholars are agreed that it is mustahabb to read Qur’aan with a sad tone, with a measured pace and with a beautiful voice. I say: this is taken from the hadeeth of Buraydah, “Recite the Qur’aan in a sad tone for it was revealed with sadness.” And the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas: “The best of people in reciting Qur’aan is the one who recites it in a sad tone.” But these hadeeths are both da’eef (weak) and the first one is da’eef jiddan (very weak).\n",

He was asked, 'O Messenger of Allaah, should we not learn it?' He said, 'Of course, whoever hears it should learn it.'\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; this is a saheeh hadeeth). The Names of Allaah mentioned in the Qur'aan and Sunnah number over one hundred, as several scholars have agreed (see Al-Qawaa'id al-Muthlaa fi Sifaat Allaahi wa Asmaa'ihi by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn 'Uthaymeen). Among these are ninety-nine names which, if one learns them and acts in accordance with them, will bring a great reward, as is indicated in the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), in which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Allaah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one; whoever learns them will enter Paradise.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2736) The learning referred to in the hadeeth includes the following: Memorizing them. Understanding their meanings. Acting upon them: so if a person learns that Allaah is al-Ahad (the One and Only), he will not associate anything else with Him; if he learns that He is al-Razzaaq (the Provider), he will not seek provision from anyone else; if he learns that He is al-Raheem (the Most Merciful), he will not despair of His Mercy, and so on. Calling upon Allaah by these Names, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them\" [al-A'raaf 7:180] - so one might say \"Yaa Rahmaan arhamni (O Most Merciful, have mercy on me),\" \"Yaa Ghafoor ighfir li (O All-Forgiving, forgive me),\" \"Yaa Tawwaab, tubb 'alayya (O Accepter of Repentance, turn towards me in forgiveness),\" and so on.

      "Praise be to Allah.The answer to your question is lengthy and deserves a book to itself. We cannot answer in details here, but we can say the following in brief: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us beforehand that this Ummah would be divided as the previous nations were divided, as stated in the saheeh hadeeth: Wahb ibn Baqiyyah told us from Khaalid from Muhammad ibn ‘Amr from Abu Salamah from Abu Hurayrah who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and the Christians were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects.” This was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, Kitaab al-Sunnah, Baab Sharh al-Sunnah. It was reported from ‘Awf ibn Maalik who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Jews were divided into seventy-one sects, one of which is in Paradise and seventy are in the Fire. The Christians were divided into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which are in the Fire and one is in Paradise. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy-two will be in the Fire.” It was said, O Messenger of Allaah, who are they? He said, “Al-Jamaa’ah.” Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 3982. What is meant by al-Jamaa’ah is the ‘aqeedah and actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions. Among the sects that claim to belong to Islam are those who are misguided with regard to the Unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and His Names and Attributes; they say that everything that exists is Allaah and that He is incarnate or present in His creation – glorified be He far above what they say. On the contrary, He is above His heavens, settled on His throne, distinct from His creation. Others are misguided with regard to eeman (faith) and say that deeds are separate from faith and that faith does not increase or decrease. The correct view is that faith consists of words and deeds; it increases when one does acts of obedience to Allaah and decreases when one commits sin. Others are misguided by their declaring that the person who commits sin goes beyond the pale of Islam and is doomed to eternity in the Fire. The correct view is that the one who commits a major sin – apart from shirk and al-kufr al-akbar – does not go out of Islam. Others are misguided with regard to the issue of al-qadaa’ wa’l-qadar (divine decree), and said that man has no choice in what he does. The correct view is that man has freedom of will on the basis of which he will be called to account and will bear the consequences of his deeds. Others are misguided with regard to the Qur’aan, and say that it is created. The correct view is that it is the words of Allaah, revealed not created. Others are misguided with regard to the Sahaabah, whom they revile and denounce as kaafirs even though they are the companions of the Prophet among whom the Wahy (Revelation) was revealed, and they are the most knowledgeable and the most devoted in worship among this Ummah, and they strove in jihaad for the sake of Allaah and Allaah supported this religion through them – may Allaah be pleased with them all. And there are other groups who deviated from the path of Islam and innovated matters in the religion of Allaah; each of them rejoices in what they have, but they have followed the ways of the Shaytaan and gone against the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): “And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-An’aam 6:153] We ask Allaah to make us among the followers of the Sunnah who will be saved from the Fire, and to admit us to Paradise among the righteous.

Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “We used to pay as Zakaat al-Fitr a saa’ of food or a saa’ of barley (which was their food at that time) or a saa’ or dates or a saa’ of aqit (dried yoghurt) or a saa’ of raisins.” (1506) From this it is clear that Zakaat al-Fitr must be food, not money, so we must adhere to what has been recorded in the Sunnah. So give one saa’ of whatever is the staple food in your country, such as rice or wheat, for example, on behalf of yourself and each member of your household. (A saa’ is equivalent to approximately 3 kilograms). It is not permissible to give it to anyone except a needy Muslim.

But there is the condition that his repentance must be sincere. Does this person truly regret what he has done? Is he indeed determined not to repeat the sin? Has he, I wonder, gotten rid of everything that may lead him to sin, such as relationships, addresses, telephone numbers, going to evil places, bad friends, movies, pictures and so on? What we believe is that if this person truly repents, he will give up this sin. Zina is one of the worst kinds of immoral deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits, a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).” [al-Isra’ 17:32]. Married people who commit zina (adultery) are to be punished with the worst and most severe form of punishment, which is to be stoned to death, so that every part of their bodies may feel pain just as they felt pleasure in a haraam manner even though they were not without a halaal source of pleasure (i.e., within marriage). Unmarried people who commit zinaa, and had never been married before, are to be given the maximum number of lashes prescribed in sharee’ah, which is one hundred lashes. In addition, they are subjected to the humiliation of having their punishment witnessed by a group of believers, and are to be banished for one full year from their city, the place where they committed the crime. The punishment for those who are guilty of zinaa in Barzakh (i.e., after death and before the Day of Resurrection) is that they will be in an oven, the top of which is narrow and the bottom of which is wide. A fire will be lit under it, and they will be naked in (that oven). When the fire is lit, they will scream and rise up until they almost come out of the oven, then when the fire subsides, they will go back down into it. This is what will keep happening to them until the Hour begins. So how will their punishment be in the Fire of Hell itself?

This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did, as is reported in a number of ahadeeth, such as the following: Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that Tufayl ibn Amr al-Dawsi and his companions came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, Daws have rebelled and disobeyed, so pray to Allaah against them. People said, Now Daws are doomed! He said, O Allaah, guide Daws and bring them here. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2937). Abu Hurayrah said: I was calling my mother to Islam, when she was still a mushrik. One day I called her to Islam and she said something about the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that upset me. I came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), weeping, and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I was calling my mother to Islam and she refused. Today I called her and she said something about you that upset me. Pray to Allaah to guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah. So the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: O Allaah, guide the mother of Abu Hurayrah. I left, feeling hopeful because of the Prophets prayer. When I got home, as I came near to the door I saw it was ajar. My mother heard my footsteps and said, Stay where you are, Abu Hurayrah! I could hear the sound of water. She washed herself, got dressed and put on her khimaar (head covering). Then she opened the door and said, O Abu Hurayrah, I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. I went back to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), weeping with joy, and said, O Messenger of Allaah, good news! Allaah has answered your prayer and has guided the mother of Abu Hurayrah. He praised and thanked Allaah, and said, That is good. I said, O Messenger of Allaah, pray to Allaah to make my mother and me dear to His believing slaves, and to make them dear to us. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, O Allaah, make this slave of Yours (meaning Abu Hurayrah) and his mother dear to Your believing slaves, and make the believers dear to them. There is no believer who hears of me or sees me, but he loves me. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4546). Jaabir said: They said, O Messenger of Allaah, we have suffered much from the arrows of Thaqeef (this was when they were fighting, before they became Muslim), so pray to Allaah against them. He said, O Allaah, guide Thaqeef. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said: this is a hasan saheeh ghareeb hadeeth. Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 3877).

Muslims believe in all the Books that were revealed by Allaah to His Prophets, without exception; whoever denies any Book is a disbeliever. On this basis, Muslims believe in Moosa (Moses) as a Prophet from Allaah, and in the original Torah as a Book from Allaah, and in ‘Eesa (Jesus) as a Prophet from Allaah, and in the original Gospel as a Book from Allaah. When the previous books were distorted and altered because of men’s desires and division among the Jews and Christians, it was no longer possible to rely on them. Allaah abrogated all previous laws (sharee’ahs) when Islam came, and all previous Books when the Qur’aan was revealed. When He sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as the final Messenger and Seal of the Prophets, it became obligatory to believe in and follow the Qur’aan which was revealed to him, especially since Allaah has guaranteed to preserve the Qur’aan and protect it from alteration and distortion, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption).” [al-Hijr 15:9] Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) is the Khaleel (Friend) of Allaah, the Father of the Prophets and the pride of the Muslims. Allaah sent him with the message of Tawheed (Divine unity) just as He sent Moosa, ‘Eesa and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them all). The happiest of mankind is one who follows his way, which is Tawheed (belief in Divine unity). Because both the Jews and Christians claimed that Ibraaheem belonged to them, Allaah explained that they were both wrong, giving decisive historical evidence in the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning): “O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibraaheem, while the Tawraat and the Injeel were not revealed till after him? Have you then no sense? Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have no knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that which you have no knowledge? It is Allaah Who knows, and you know not. Ibraaheem was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim haneefa (Islamic monotheism – worshipping none but Allaah alone), and he was not of al-mushrikoon (polytheists). Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibraaheem are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad (peace andb lessings of Allaah be upon him) and those who have believed (Muslims). And Allaah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:65-68] Become Muslim and you will be saved. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There follow some details about the issue of women upholding their ties of kinship, and what they should do with husbands who prevent them from doing so. Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory even for females, who must uphold them as much as they can. Therefore it is not permissible for a man to prevent his wife or daughter from upholding her ties of kinship, and if he stops her from visiting them, but he lets her convey greetings to them, whether by letter or through a third person, or send them gifts, then she should do that. It is sufficient even if she only sends greetings without a gift, but if she sends her greetings with a gift, that is better. If he stops her from sending a gift but allows her to send greetings, then she should send greetings. If he allows her to send a gift but stops her from sending greetings, then she should send a gift. If he allows her to go and see them, then she should go. If he stops her from doing anything that comes under the heading of upholding ties of kinship, then there is no obedience to any created being if it involves disobedience to the Creator. In this case she should maintain her family ties in the way that is least objectionable to her husband or father, whether it is sending gifts or conveying greetings, and she can conceal that if she is fearful. If her relatives are faced with some hardship, she should help them with what they need, even if he says not to. She should uphold her family ties by offering condolences in the case of bereavement or loss, and condolence means advising patience. She should also congratulate them on joyful occasions, and congratulating them means praying that they will enjoy to the full whatever has brought them joy, and that it will not be spoilt for them. Such joyful events include the return of a traveller, a wedding, etc. She should not adorn herself or display her adornment in front of those to whom she should not show herself, such as cousins (sons of maternal uncles or paternal uncles), and she should convey her greetings to them from behind a barrier and without making her voice soft, but this is only in cases where there is no fear of fitnah, otherwise she may convey greetings through a third party. She does not have to attend funerals. It is not permissible for the husband to stop his wife from upholding the ties of kinship even if it involves her going out, but she should not go out except with his permission. The same applies to fathers. The wife should treat her husband gently so that she will still be able to fulfil her shar’i duty of upholding the ties of kinship.

Praise be to Allah.40-Day Rule after Birth in Islam Forty days is the longest period that the woman in nifas can refrain from praying and fasting , so long as blood is still flowing. After that, she should do ghusl and pray, and consider herself to be in a state of istihadah (irregular vaginal bleeding which is neither menstruation nor nifas) if the bleeding does not stop. Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “At the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the woman in nifas would sit (i.e., refrain from praying and fasting) for forty days…” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi). Can women go out during the nifas period? With regard to the belief that a woman has to stay in her house for forty days after giving birth and not go out, this is a mistaken belief and women do not have to do this. It is permissible for them to go out during these forty days to any place she wants, so long as she fulfills the shar’i conditions (i.e., hijab etc.) And Allah knows best.\n",

Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"The people of Nuh denied (their Messenger) before them, they rejected Our slave, and said: A madman! and he was insolently rebuked and threatened. Then he invoked his Lord (saying): I have been overcome, so help (me)! So We opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth. And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs. So the waters (of the heaven and the earth) met for a matter predestined. And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails, Floating under Our Eyes, a reward for him who had been rejected! And, indeed, We have left this as a sign, is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)? Then how (terrible) was My Torment and My Warnings!\" [al-Qamar 54:9-16] In his Tafseer, Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"And, indeed, We have left this as a sign, is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)? refers to this story, which serves as a lesson.\" It was also suggested that it referred to the ship or ark itself, which was left so that those who came after the people of Nuh might learn lessons from it and not reject the Messengers. Qutaadah said: \"Allaah left it in Baaqirdi in the Arabian Peninsula (a place in Iraq), as a lesson and a sign, so that the first generations of this ummah would see it. How many ships have there been after it that have turned to dust and left no trace!\" The apparent meaning is that this refers to ships in general, as in the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning): \"And an aayah (sign) for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship (of Nuh), And We have created for them of the like thereunto, so on them they ride.\" Yaa-Seen 36:41-42] \"Verily! When the water rose beyond its limits [Nuhs Flood], We carried you [mankind] in the floating (ship that was constructed by Nuh). That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear (person) may (hear and) understand it.\" [al-Haaqqah 69:11-12] Hence Allaah says here \"is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)?\" i.e., is there anyone who will remember and learn? In his tafseer of the words \"We have left this as a sign\" Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, mentions three opinions: 1. That Allaah has left this story as a lesson to those who come after the people of Nuh; 2. That Allaah has left the ship of Nuh so that subsequent nations may see it and learn from it how Allaah saved the believers and destroyed the kuffaar. 3. That Allaah taught mankind how to make ships and left this invention as a reminder of His blessings and how Nuhs children and the believers were saved by means of a ship like those which are well-known. In any case, there is nothing that would go against either Islamic teaching or reason if Nuhs ark were to be discovered and if generations of mankind after Nuh were to see it, because it would be a sign to them. The issue would be how to prove that the ship discovered was really Nuhs ark; not everyone who finds an ancient ship and claims it to be Nuhs ark is to be believed. And Allaah knows best.\n",

As for useful books which we need to keep at home, like reference books and dictionaries that may contain pictures that are difficult to erase, we can keep them as long as we blot out any pictures on the cover.

      "Praise be to Allah. The answer to your question may be found in the ahaadeeth of Saheeh al-Bukhaari and the commentary of al-Haafiz al-‘Asqallaani, which are quoted below: ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me when I was six years old. Then we came to Madeenah and stayed in Bani al-Haarith ibn Khazraj. I fell ill and my hair started to fall out (due to the illness; then it grew back thick again). My mother Umm Roomaan came to me whilst I was on a swing and my friends were with me. She shouted for me and I came to her, not knowing what she wanted. She took me by the hand and led me to the door of the house. I was out of breath and we waited until I had calmed down, then she took some water and wiped my face and head, then took me inside. There were some women of the Ansaar in the house, and they said: \" ‘Alaa al-khayri wa’l-baraka wa ‘ala khayri taa’ir (blessings, best wishes, etc).\" My mother handed me over to them and they tidied me up, then suddenly the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was there. It was mid-morning, and they handed me over to him. At that time I was nine years old.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3605). ‘Urwah said: \"Khadeejah died three years before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) migrated to Madeenah. He stayed alone for two years or thereabouts, then he married ‘Aa’ishah when she was six years old, and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3607) The phrase \"he married ‘Aa’ishah\" means that the marriage contract was drawn up; the marriage was consummated later on, when she was nine. Muslim reports from al-Zuhri, from ‘Urwah, that ‘Aa’ishah said that she was taken to him when she was nine years old, and she took her toys with her. He died when she was eighteen years old. Muslim also reports a similar account from ‘Aa’ishah via al-Aswad. He reports from ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Urwah from his father that ‘Aa’ishah said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me in Shawwaal and consummated the marriage with me in Shawwaal.\" ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her when she was six years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, and she stayed with him for nine years.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4738) Al-Bukhaari calls this chapter of his Saheeh \"Baab inkaah al-rajul wuldahu (or waladahu) al-sighaar (Chapter on a man marrying off his young children).\" The fact that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \". . . and for those who have no courses [periods] [(i.e., they are still immature) their ‘iddah is three months likewise, except in case of death] . . .\" [al-Talaaq 65:4] is an indication that it is permissible to marry girls below the age of adolescence. This is a good understanding, but the aayah makes no specific mention of either the father or the young girl. It could be said that the basic principle concerning marrying children is that it is forbidden unless there is specific evidence (daleel) to indicate otherwise. The hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah states that her father Abu Bakr married her off before the age of puberty, but there is no other evidence apart from that, so the rule applies to all other cases. Al- Muhallab said: \"[The scholars] agreed that it is permissible for a father to marry off his young virgin daughter, even though it is not usually the case to have intercourse with such a young woman.\"(The above was summarized from Fath al-Baari Sharh ‘ala Saheeh al-Bukhaari) In summary, then, it is permitted to contract marriage with a young girl and to hand her over to her husband to stay with him before she reaches adolescence. As for consummating the marriage, this does not happen until she is physically able for it. Thus the matter becomes quite clear. Do you see anything wrong with a man living with his young wife in one house, bringing her up and teaching her, but delaying consummation until she is ready for it? We ask Allaah to show us truth and falsehood and to make each clear. And Allaah knows best.\n",

He said: The woman in ihraam should not cover her face with a veil or wear gloves. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1707). Some of the scholars mentioned that a woman may uncover her left eye in order to see where she is going, and if necessary she may uncover both eyes. The opening should only be wide enough for the eyes, and the woman should beware of wearing a niqaab with wide openings lest the beauty of her eyes becomes apparent and the niqaab becomes a means of temptation instead of a veil covering her beauty and adornment.\n",

And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts . . .\" [al-Ahzaab 33:53] \". . . then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner.\" [al-Ahzaab 33:32] Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer: \"This means that they should not speak softly. Allaah commanded them to speak in a concise and decisive manner (i.e., they should be serious and brief in their speech, and not be vague or talk aimlessly). There should be no possible indication on the face that could be taken to indicate any softness in the heart, as the Arab women (before Islaam) used to do when speaking to men, by making their voices soft like women who are taking care of small children, or like prostitutes. Allaah forbade women to do that. The phrase \"lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire\" means lest such a person should hope for immoral deeds, indecency or romance. \"Speaking in an honourable manner\" means speaking in a way that does not go against Sharee’ah or offend people. Women are encouraged when speaking to men to whom they are not related and to mahrams among their in-laws to be somewhat rough or abrupt in their speech, without raising the voice, because they are commanded to lower their voice. Speaking with a woman to whom one is not related (i.e., not mahram) should only be for a specific need, such as asking a question, buying or selling, asking about the head of the household, and so on. Such conversations should be brief, with nothing doubtful in either what is said or how it is said. The idea of limiting speech with women to the five instances mentioned in the question needs to be approached with caution, because they could be taken as examples instead of limits. One must also adhere to the conditions set out by the Sharee’ah even in instances where such conversations are necessary, such as in da’wah, giving fatwas, buying or selling, etc. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It was reported in the hadeeth that you should say salaam to those you know and those you do not (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 12; al-Fath 1/55) but this applies only to Muslims, or those who appear to be Muslim. It was also reported that it is forbidden to say salaam to Jews and Christians, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not initiate the greeting of salaam to a Jew or Christian, and if you meet them in the street, push them to the narrowest part of the road.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2167). He also said: “If the People of the Book greet you with salaam, say ‘wa ‘alaykum’ (and also upon you).” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6258). But at that time the People of the Book were distinct from the Muslims in their dress and appearance, and they were not allowed to resemble Muslims. But in these times, unfortunately, many Muslims look like them, and we can no longer tell the difference between a Muslim and a Christian. Everyone - except for those whom Allaah wills – looks the same in dress, in being clean-shaven, in wearing nothing on their heads, or wearing western-style caps, so the matter is more confusing. If someone who looks like the mushrikeen says salaam to you, say “Wa ‘alaykum,” and do not initiate the greeting, because of the uncertainty about him. If he objects and tells you off, then apologize to him. You had reason to act as you did, because you did know whether he was a Muslim or a Christian, because he is not dressing as a Muslim and prefers the dress of the Christians and others. Tell him that “whoever imitates a people is one of them” (Saheeh, narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 2/50-92), and advise him to distinguish himself from the kuffaar and to dress as the Muslims dress, like his father, grandfathers and the scholars of the Muslims. If he persists in what he is doing, this means that he likes the characteristics of the Christians and is imitating them, and that he despises the Muslims and is going against them, even though he does not gain anything from that besides blind imitation. This indicates that he admires those kuffaar and thinks that their worldly achievements and inventions, etc., stem from their false religion. This is going too far, for the Muslims are wiser and more able to invent and produce, so he should not be deceived by the Mushrikeen.\n",

A person will only be rewarded for what he himself reads or listens to in order to benefit from it. But if another person reads and he does not listen, the reward for that will go to the person who read it. These people are not considered to have completed the whole Qur’aan; but if each person has read a juz’ he will be rewarded for that. But they should not do this; either one person should read and the others listen, or each person should read by himself without making a connection between his reading and that of the others.\n",

The belief that all religions on earth are correct and that their followers are all following the truth is one of the gravest falsehoods and one of the greatest examples of kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning); “…Say: ‘Are those who know equal to those who know not?’…” [al-Zumar 39:9] “And not equal are the blind and those who see; nor are (equal) those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous good deeds, and those who do evil. Little do you remember! [Ghaafir 40:58] “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?’ Say: ‘(It is) Allaah.’ Say: ‘Have you then taken (for worship) Awliyaa’ (protectors) other than Him, such as have no power either for benefit or for harm to themselves?’ Say: ‘Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light?’” [al-Ra’d 13:16] “Say (O Muhammad): ‘Not equal are Al-Khabeeth (all that is evil and bad as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods) and At-Tayyib (all that is good as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)…’” [al-Maa’idah 5:100] “Not alike are the blind (disbelievers in Islamic Monotheism) and the seeing (believers in Islamic Monotheism). Nor are (alike) darkness (disbelief) and light (belief in Islamic Monotheism). Nor are (alike) the shade and the sun’s heat. Nor are (alike) the living (i.e., the believers) and the dead (i.e., the disbelievers). Verily, Allaah makes whom He wills to hear, but you cannot make hear those who are in graves” [Faatir 35:19-22] With regard to the ultimate destiny of the person referred to in the question, and whether he will be excused for his ignorance or not, and what his situation will be on the Day of Resurrection, we believe that his case rests with Allaah.

      "Contents Related Why is interest haram? Does accepting riba make is halal? Praise be to Allah.Why is interest haram? Riba (which means adding something extra to certain products, like selling gold for gold, or by not receiving something when a contract is signed, or paying extra in return for extension of a loan) is haram because Allah - Who rules as He wills - has forbidden it. No one can ask Him about what He does; He is the One Who will ask people about what they did, on the Day of Resurrection. Allah has explained that riba is haram, and warned those who do not give it up, in the verses (interpretation of the meaning): \"O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from riba (usury) (from now onward), if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger . . .\" [al-Baqarah 2:278-279] Does accepting riba make is halal? One of the most important points to remember about Islamic Shari`ah - and this is one of the major differences between Shari`ah and earthly jahili laws - is that mutual consent to commit a haram deed does not make it halal. If a man and a woman agree to commit zina (fornication or adultery), it does not become halal. If a businessman agrees with the bank to deposit a sum of money in the bank and take interest on it, or to take out a loan and pay interest on it, that does not make such transactions halal. Things that are haram will remain so until the Day of Judgement. Man is ignorant and inclined to do wrong. He may not even know what is in his own interests or in the interests of others, so he may do things that harm himself or others. You state in your question that you want to give some money to a person to invest it, in return for something. There is nothing wrong with that if it is done in accordance with Shari`ah, which includes a contract of silent partnership - i.e., you give money to someone to do business on your behalf, in return for an agreed percentage of the profits. According to Shari`ah, a contract of silent partnership includes the following: The one who receives the money for investment is not permitted to guarantee the capital and is not expected to repay it except in cases of recklessness or negligence. In the event of loss, the investor loses his capital and the one who took the money loses the time and effort invested. May Allah help you and us to earn a halal income. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This will is not permissible, because it goes against the teachings of sharee’ah and is contrary to the justice and fairness that Allaah has enjoined, especially among one's children. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “There is a share for men and a share for women from what is left by parents and those nearest related, whether, the property be small or large — a legal share” [al-Nisaa’ 4:7] Then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning); “Allaah commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allaah. And Allaah is Ever All‑Knower, All‑Wise” [al-Nisaa’ 4:11] Then Allaah warns those who go against this division of legacies and play with it, by saying (interpretation of the meaning); “And whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment”[al-Nisaa’ 4:14] Whoever deprives some of his children of their inheritance, or gives some of them less than is their shar’i due, or gives some more than is their shar’i due, or includes someone who is not an heir among those who are given his legacy, is a sinner who is guilty of committing a major sin. Also, it is not permissible to make a will concerning one’s heir, because he has a share which is defined by sharee’ah. Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on them) narrated from Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has given everyone who is entitled his rights, so there is no will concerning the heir.” (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2046). If it is proven according to sharee’ah that one of the children is a kaafir, e.g. by the fact that he does not pray, at the time of the father’s death, then he is not an heir, even if instructions to that effect are not mentioned in the will, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not inherit from the kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from the Muslim.” (Saheeh – agreed upon). With regard to giving a gift to one of one's children and not to the others for no shar’i reason, this is haraam and is unfair, as it creates hatred in the children’s hearts towards one another. The evidence (daleel) that it is forbidden is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on them) from al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him), that his father came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I have given this son of mine one of my slaves.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Have you given all your children a similar gift?” He said, “No.” He said, “Then take it back.” According to the version narrated by Muslim, he said: “Fear Allaah and treat your children fairly.” So my father took back his gift. According to another version, he (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “My father took me to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, bear witness that I have given al-Nu’maan such-and-such of my wealth.’ He said, ‘Have you given all your children something similar to what you have given to al-Nu’maan?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Then let someone else bear witness.’ Then he said, ‘Would you not like all your children to honour you equally?’ He said, ‘Of course.’ He said, ‘Then you should not do that.’” (Muslim, 3059). But if the gift is being given to one of the children for a shar’i reason, such as the child being poor, or in debt, or needing medical treatment, then there is nothing wrong with that. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad, and grant him peace.\n",

We will quote below a number of hadiths which describe Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If what you saw in your dream is in accordance with this, then you did indeed see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because he said: \"Whoever sees me in a dream has really seen me, because Shaytan cannot appear in my image.\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5729) Rabi'ah ibn Abi 'Abd al-Rahman said: \"I heard Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) describing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: 'He was of average height, not too tall and not too short, with a pinkish colour, not very white and not dark, and his hair was neither very curly nor very straight. The Revelation came to him when he was forty years old, and he stayed in Makkah for ten years after the Revelation came, then in Madinah for ten years. When he died, there were no more than twenty white hairs on his head and in his beard.\" (Al-Bukhari, 3283) Al-Bara ibn 'Azib said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was broad shouldered and had thick hair coming down to his shoulders and earlobes. He was wearing red garments. I have never seen anything more beautiful than him.\" (Reported by Muslim, Kitab al-Fadail, Bab Sifat Sha'r al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), no. 2338) 'Ali said: \"He was neither tall nor short, and had large hands and feet. He had a large head and was big-boned, and the thin line of hair (starting from his chest and extending to the navel) was long. When he walked, he would lean forward, as if he was walking downhill. I have never seen anyone like him, before or since.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3570, who said this is a sahih hasan hadith). Jabir ibn Samurah said: \"The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was dali' al-fam, ash-kal al-'ayn and manhus al-'aqib.\" Shu'bah said: \"I asked Malik, 'What is dalه' al-fam?' He said: 'Wide-mouthed.' I asked, 'What is ash-kal al-'ayn?' He said, 'Big-eyed.' I asked, 'What is manhus al-'aqib?' He said, 'His heels were not fleshy.'\" (Sahih Muslim, Kitab al-Fadail, 2339) As for the sin which you committed in the house of your brothers, repent to Allah for this.

      "Praise be to Allah. Imaam Abu Abdullaah Muhammad ibn Ismaaeel al-Bukhaari reported, in al-Jaami al-Saheeh, which is the soundest book after the Quraan: \"Ibraaheem ibn al-Mundhir told me that Man told us that Maalik told me, from Abdullaah ibn Deenaar from Ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: The keys of the Unknown are five, which no-one knows except Allaah: no-one knows what will happen tomorrow except Allaah; no-one knows what is in the wombs except Allaah; no-one knows when it will rain except Allaah; no-one knows in which land he will die; and no-one knows when the Hour will begin except Allaah.\" (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Tafseer al-Quraan, hadeeth no. 4328). He also reported it with the wording: \"The keys of the Unseen are five: Verily, Allah! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He send down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily Allaah is All-Knower, All-Aware (of things) [Luqmaan 31:34].\" (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Tafseer al-Quraan, Baab (wa indahu mafaatih al-ghaybi laa yalamu illaa huwa), hadeeth no. 4261). Allaah is the only One Who has knowledge of the Unseen, as He says (Interpretation of the meaning) : \"Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Unseen except Allaah . . .\" [al-Naml 27:65] The Unseen referred to in this aayah is the same as that described in Soorat Luqmaan (see quote in preceding paragraph). There is no doubt whatsoever that this hadeeth is saheeh. What has confused the questioner is the fact that doctors are able to know the gender of the foetus via x-rays and ultrasound scans, but we should note that this knowledge is vague and incomplete. They may make mistakes, as has happened on numerous occasions. Moreover, they can only perform these scans etc. after a certain number of weeks of pregnancy have passed, and not before. Even if they know whether the foetus is male or female, they do not know whether it will be miscarried or carried to term, whether it will be born alive or dead. They do not know the precise length of time that it will stay in its mothers womb. They have nothing but conjecture and uncertainties. They do not know how long this person will live, how he will behave or what his provision will be, or whether he will be of the people of Paradise or the people of Hell. Knowledge of what is in the wombs is not merely a matter of knowing whether the foetus is male or female; it is broader than that, and no-one can know it all except Allaah, as He says (Interpretation of the meaning): \"Allaah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due) proportion.\" [al-Rad 13:8] In his Tafseer of this aayah, Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"Allaah is telling us here of His complete knowledge: nothing is hidden from Him and He knows fully what the females of every species carry in their wombs. He says (Interpretation of the meaning): (He) knows that which is in the wombs, i.e., He knows whether it is male or female, good or bad, destined for Paradise or doomed to Hell, whether its life will be long or short. Similarly He says (Interpretation of the meaning): He knows you well when He created you from the earth, and when you were foetuses in your mothers wombs [al-Najm 53:32] In the two Saheehs there is a report from Ibn Masood, who said: The Messenger of Allah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"The way that each of you is created is that he is gathered in your mothers womb for forty days and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then an angel is sent and he breathes the spirit into him and is charged with four commands: to write down his provision, his life-span, his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy.\" According to another hadeeth, the angel says: O Lord, male or female? Wretched or happy? How much provision? How long a life span? and he writes that.\" Al-Awfi said, from Ibn Abbaas: \"and by how much the wombs fall short\" refers to miscarriage, and or exceed means how how far beyond the normal time the pregnancy will last before a child is born, because some women carry a child for ten months and some for nine months; the length of pregnancy varies from woman to woman. This is what is referred to here. Al-Dahhaak said, from Ibn Abbaas, that this phrase referred to pregnancies longer or shorter than nine months.\" Every Muslim must believe in what the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) has told us, and not doubt a single word of it, because what the Prophet says is wahy (revelation) revealed to him by Allaah: \"By the star when it goes down, your companion (i.e., Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only an Inspiration [wahy] that is inspired.\" [al-Najm 53:1-4] Whoever doubts what the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said or doubts that it is wahy is a kaafir who has left Islam. The Muslim must believe that what the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said is absolutely true. This is shown in the hadeeth of Abdullaah ibn Amar, who said: \"I used to write down everything that I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), because I wanted to memorize it. Quraysh told me not to do that and said: Are you writing everything down that you hear? The Messenger of Allaah is only a man who may speak when he is angry or happy. So I stopped writing things down, and I mentioned this to the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him). He pointed to his mouth and said: Write; by the One in Whose hand is my soul, nothing comes out of it (my mouth) but the truth.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud, may Allaah have mercy on him, in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Ilm, hadeeth no. 3161, see also Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 1196).

      "Praise be to Allah.There is no basis in shareeah for taking the crescent or star as a symbol of the Muslims. This was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or at the time of the Khulafa al-Raashidoon (the first four leaders of Islam after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or during the time of the Umawis (Umayyad dynasty). It emerged some time after that, and historians differ as to when this symbol was first adopted and who was the first to adopt it. Some say it was the Persians, others say it was the Greeks, and that this symbol was somehow passed to the Muslims. (See Al-Taraateeb al-Idaariyah by al-Kittaani, 1/320). It was said that the reason why the Muslims adopted the crescent was that when they conquered some western countries, the churches there had crosses on top of them, the Muslims replaced the crosses with these crescents, and the practice spread in this way. Whatever the case, symbols and banners must be in accordance with the teachings of Islam, and as there is no evidence that this symbol is prescribed by Islam, it is better not to use it. Neither the crescent nor the star are symbols of the Muslims, even though some Muslims may use them as symbols. As regards what Muslims think about the moon and the stars, they believe that they are part of the creation of Allaah, and as such can neither benefit nor harm people, and they do not have any influence over events on earth. Allaah has created them for the benefit of mankind, an example of which is seen in the aayah or verse of the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage [al-Baqarah 2:189] [The commentator] Ibn Katheer said, explaining the phrase Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time: From them (the new moons) they may know the times for repaying loans, the iddah (waiting period) of their women [after being divorced or widowed] and the timing of their Hajj (pilgrimage) Allaah has made them signs to mark the times when Muslims should start to fast and break their fast [the beginning and end of Ramadaan], to count the iddah of their women and to know the times for repaying loans. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). [Another commentator] Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this aayah [verse]: This explains the wisdom behind the waxing and waning of the moon, which is to avoid any confusion in appointed dates, dealings, oaths, Hajj, iddah, fasting, breaking fasts, length of pregnancy, rentals and other matters that concern mankind. Similar to this aayah are others (interpretation of the meanings): And We have appointed the night and the day as two aayaat (signs). Then, We have made dark the sign of the night while We have made the sign of day illuminating, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning [al-Isra 17:12] It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of years and the reckoning [Yoonus 10:5] Counting the new moons is easier than counting days. (See Tafseer al-Qurtubi). With regard to the stars, the scholars of Islam say that Allaah created these stars for three reasons: to adorn the heavens, to drive away the devils (shayaateen) and as signs for navigation. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Bad al-Khalq), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): It is He Who has set the stars for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea [al-Anaam 6:97] And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the shayaateen (devils), and have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.

This goes against Tawheed, or it either compromises its integrity or uproots it altogether, depending on the persons intentions. The reports about some of the Salaf insisting by an oath that Allaah should do something probably refer to their duaas (supplications). The hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): There are among the slaves of Allaah those who, if they were to insist by an oath that Allaah should do something, He would fulfil it (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2703) is hypothetical in nature, meaning that Allaah would respond to such a person's duaa although it is known that nobody would dare to address their Lord in this manner.

Interpreting the hadeeth “Fast when you see it and stop fasting when you see it” as meaning that no individual should fast until he sees the new moon for himself is incorrect, because the hadeeth is telling everyone to fast when the sighting is confirmed, even if only one trustworthy Muslim sees the new moon. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 10/94). Further evidence that the sighting of the new moon by one trustworthy, reliable Muslim is sufficient for fasting to be obligatory on all the people is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: “The people went out to sight the new moon and I told the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that I had seen it, so he fasted and told the people to fast.” (Reported by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, Kitaab al-Sawm, Baab fi Shahaadat al-Waahid ‘ala ru’yat hilaali Ramadaan). Some of those who follow bid’ah delay fasting until after all the other Muslims have started to fast, because of their misguided belief that fasting is not obligatory on a person until he sees the new moon for himself. The ahaadeeth refute this, and we would ask them moreover: what are those who are blind or who have poor eyesight supposed to do? It is as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.” [al-Hajj 22:46]. And Allaah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Islam is easy and its rules apply to everyone, mankind and jinn alike, regardless of whether they are scholars or illiterate, settled or nomadic. So Allaah made it easy for them to know the times for the acts of worship, and made their beginning and end signs which everyone can know. He made the setting of the sun the sign for the beginning of Maghrib and the end of ‘Asr, and He made the disappearance of the red glow in the sky the sign of the beginning of the time of ‘Isha’. He made the sighting of the moon after its disappearance at the end of the month the sign of the beginning of the new lunar month and the end of the previous month. He did not give us the task of knowing the beginning of the lunar month from something which is known to only a small number of people, namely astronomy and its calculations. Thus the texts of the Qur’aan and Sunnah make the actual sighting of the new moon the signal for the Muslims to start fasting Ramadaan; they stop fasting when they see the new moon of Shawwaal; the dates of Eid al-Adhaa and Yawm ‘Arafaat are similarly determined. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “… So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month…” [al-Baqarah 2:185] “They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage…” [al-Baqarah 2:189] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made the beginning of the fast conditional upon the confirmed sighting of the new moon of Ramadaan, and the ending of the fast conditional upon the confirmed sighting of the new moon of Shawwaal; he did not connect this to calculations of the movements of stars or other heavenly bodies. This is how it was done at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), during the rule of the Khulafa’ al-Raashidoon, at the time of the four imaams, and during the three centuries which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said were the best. Referring to calculations of the lunar months to start and end periods of worship, instead of actually sighting the new moon, is a bid’ah (reprehensible innovation) that has no good in it and has no basis in sharee’ah. The best of all is to follow the salaf in religious matters, and the worst of all is to follow newly-invented innovations in religion. May Allaah protect us and you and all the Muslims from tribulation, both obvious and hidden.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.On the basis of the opinion that it is permissible to keep animals in cages, visiting places designed for the purpose of displaying these animals to the public such as those known nowadays as zoos, for the purpose of enjoying looking at the different types of animals, is permissible. It is no exaggeration to say that doing so is in fact mustahabb and encouraged, when the motive for this is to think about the creation of Allaah and His Signs by looking at these animals and finding out about their different ways of life and so on. This has a good effect on a person’s heart, namely it strengthens his faith in his Lord and in His exalted attributes, for example, His Power, Ability and Wisdom. When we understand the good effects of visits to these zoos, the wisdom behind the Qur’aan’s call to think about the greatness and majesty of creation will become clear. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Do they not look in the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all things that Allaah has created…?” [al-A’raaf 7:185]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Think about the signs of Allaah, do not think about Allaah.” (Reported by al-Bayhaqi in al-Shu’ab, 1/136 and by al-Laalakaa’i in al-Sunnah, 3/525. See al-Saheehah, 4/395). But we should not omit to note here the many wrong things that happen in zoos, such as mixing of men and women. Even in places where some days are set aside just for men to visit and other days just for women, there may be some women wearing types of clothing that it is not even permissible for them to wear in front of other women. We must therefore prepare da’wah programs to be carried out in these places so that we may fulfil our duty of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, thus making sure that there is no room in these places for license and things that go against Islam. With regard to zoos in countries where it is not possible to achieve this kind of reform, Muslims should choose the most suitable time to take their children to the zoo; they should avoid places of evil and protect themselves and their children from seeing anything that could adversely affect their faith. And Allaah is the Source of Strength.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is difficult to say what their reaction will be. Most parents want their children to marry in accordance with their wishes, and in most cases they will have chosen a wife for their son from their own country, whose customs and tradition are closer to those of the society in which they live. The idea of their son marrying a western woman may be very strange for them and difficult to accept, especially if they have heard about the widespread promiscuity in the West and the freedom with which Western women enter into relationships. They may also want their son to be near them, and they may be afraid that if he marries someone overseas they will only see him rarely. They may warn him about the consequences of raising his future children in a non-Islamic environment. On the other hand, they might agree if they hear that their son is going to marry a decent, upright Muslim girl, especially if their son is going to stay on and work in the West after completing his studies, and if they give any weight to their son’s own wishes – which is a matter that differs from family to family. Whatever the case, you will not lose anything by entering Islam, whether you marry this man or not. If you become Muslim and marry this man, after you both repent from the forbidden relationship, then you will have got what you wanted. If this marriage is not destined for you, then maybe Allaah will send you another good, clean Muslim man whom you can marry and be happy with. The most important thing here is that you understand that striving to please Allaah by following His religion is more important than all other considerations. In any case, we hope that you will become Muslim and that your hopes will be realized in accordance with the laws of Allaah. Thank you for your trust and your question.\n",

      "Contents Related When does marriage become obligatory? Status of marriage in Islam Benefits of marriage Praise be to Allah.When does marriage become obligatory? In response to your question, we will look briefly at what some of the Muslim jurists have written on this topic. In Mawahib al-Jaleel it was said: “Marriage is obligatory for a woman who is unable to feed or clothe herself unless she gets married.” In al-Sharh al-Kabir, concerning obligatory marriage it says: “If a person fears that he may commit fornication, it (marriage) is obligatory on him.” In Fath al-Wahhab, it says: “For the woman who has (physical) desires, marriage is sunnah, just as it is for the one who needs maintenance and the one who fears being taken advantage of by immoral persons.” In Mughni al-Muhtaj, it says: “(Marriage) becomes wajib (obligatory) if a person fears fornication… And it was said that it becomes obligatory if a person has made a vow (nadhr) to get married.” Then concerning the ruling with regard to women: “If she needs to get married, i.e., she has physical desires, or needs maintenance, or she is afraid that immoral people may take advantage of her… it is preferable (mustahabb) for her to get married, because this will protect her religion and her chastity, and she can enjoy what her husband spends on her, and other advantages.” Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni: “Our colleagues differed as to whether marriage is obligatory. The best-known opinion in our madhhab is that it is not obligatory, except when a person is afraid of committing a forbidden deed if he does not marry. In that case he should make himself chaste (i.e. get married). This is the opinion of the majority of fuqaha.” When it comes to marriage, people are of three types, one of which is those who fear that they may commit forbidden deeds if they do not get married. It is obligatory for such people to get married, according to the majority of jurists, because it is obligatory for them to make themselves chaste and protect themselves from haram. In Subul al-Salam it says: “Ibn Daqiq al-‘Eid said that some of the jurists said that marriage is obligatory for the one who fears sin or hardship (because of suppressing physical desires) and is able to marry… and it is obligatory for the one who cannot avoid fornication unless he gets married.” In Badai’ al-Sanai’, it says: “There is no dispute that marriage is an obligation when desire is strong. If a person has such a strong desire for women that he cannot be patient, and he can afford to pay the mahr (dowry) and support a wife, then if he does not get married, he is a sinner.” From the above discussion, we can see a number of situations in which marriage is obligatory. You might ask: “How can we imagine a woman fulfilling this obligation when usually it is the man who goes around knocking on doors looking for a partner? This is not the woman’s role.” The answer is: what a woman can do to fulfill this command is not to refuse marriage when a suitable, compatible man comes with an offer of marriage. Status of marriage in Islam Muslim women and men need to understand the high status which marriage has in Islam, so that they will be more keen to marry. There follows a useful summary on this topic by al-Imam Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him), from his book al-Mughni: “The basis of the legislation of marriage is the Quran, Sunnah and ijma’ (consensus of the scholars). In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): ‘… marry women of your choice, two or three, or four…’ [al-Nisa 4:3] and ‘And marry those among you who are single and (also marry) the salihun (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves)…’ [al-Nur 24:32]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “O young men! Whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for this will lower his gaze and protect his chastity. Whoever cannot (get married), then let him fast, for fasting will be a protection for him.”(Agreed upon). There are many other verses and reports like these. The Muslims agree that marriage is legislated. Ibn Mas’ud said: “If I only had ten days left to live, and I knew that I would die at the end of them, and I was able to get married, I would do so, for fear of fitnah (temptation).” Ibn 'Abbas said to Sa’id ibn Jubayr: “Get married, for the best of this ummah are those who have more wives.” Ibrahim ibn Maysarah said: “Tawus said to me: ‘Either you get married, or I will say to you what ‘Umar said to Abu’l-Zawaid: There is nothing stopping you from getting married but either impotence or immorality!’ According to al-Mirwadhi, Ahmad said: ‘Celibacy has nothing to do with Islam. Whoever calls you not to get married is calling you to something other than Islam.’” Benefits of marriage Then he said (may Allah have mercy on him): “The benefits of marriage are many. They include: protecting one’s religion and helping one to adhere to it; protecting and taking care of women; and producing offspring and increasing the ranks of the ummah, thus achieving the pride of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), etc.” [Translator’s note: there is a hadith which indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will feel proud of the large numbers of his ummah in the Hereafter, so Muslims are encouraged to marry and have many children.] It should now be clear that the benefits of marriage are many. No wise Muslim woman would hesitate to get married, especially if an offer of marriage comes from a person who is strongly committed to Islam and is possessed of a good character and morals. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is sihr that can kill. When discussing different forms of murder the scholars have mentioned that the person who kills another by means of a kind of sihr that usually kills should be executed (qisaas – retaliation), because he has killed by means of something that usually kills. Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (9/330): “The sixth kind: if he killed him by means of a kind of sihr that usually kills, then he has to be executed, because he has killed by means of something that usually kills, like killing by use of a knife. If he killed by means of something that does not usually kill or something that sometimes kills and sometimes does not, then he has to pay diyah (blood-money), but qisaas is not required, because he intended to do harm, and it is akin to beating someone with a stick (which may or may not kill).” The ruling concerning the saahir (practitioner of sihr) in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (24/267) says that in the case where he killed a person by means of his sihr… the majority say that killing by means of sihr may be done deliberately, in which case qisaas is required. According to the Maalikis, evidence or a confession is required. According to the Shaafi’is, if the person whom the practitioner of sihr killed was his equal , then qisaas is required if the killing was deliberate, which may be proven by a confession on the part of the saahir, such as his saying “I killed him by means of my sihr”, or “I killed him with this type of thing”, supported by the testimony of two reliable witnesses who have practised sihr in the past but have now repented, who can confirm that this kind of sihr usually kills. If it is a type that does not usually kill, then the matter is more akin to manslaughter. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Our advice is that you should try to fast the two consecutive months during cold or temperate days when the days will be shorter and it will be less difficult for you, or during the annual leave which your employer gives you, and other opportunities which you can make use of for this purpose. If you really and truly cannot fast, then it is permissible for you to feed sixty poor persons. You could give them food in stages – according to what you are able to do – until you have fed the complete number. Your wife also has to make a similar expiation if she was a willing partner in the act of intercourse during the day in Ramadan. If the number of times that intercourse took place happened on different days, then you have to offer expiation for each day on which the sanctity of the sacred month was broken. The author of Kifaayat al-Taalib said: “The number of expiations corresponds to the number of days, not to the number of times the act was repeated on one day before the payment of any expiation. This is by consensus (of the scholars).” It was said in Haashiyat al-Dasooqi: “It is not counted by the number of times a person ate or had intercourse in one day.” The author of Mughni al-Muhtaaj said: “Expiation is counted by the number of misdeeds… (whoever had intercourse on two different days must pay expiation twice)… because each day is a separate, independent act of worship, so the expiation for both cannot be combined… If the act of intercourse happened several times in one day, the separate acts are not counted [i.e. one expiation is sufficient].” Allaah burdens not any person, but that which he can bear. The hadeeth to which you refer in your question was narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “Whilst we were sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), a man came to him and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, I am doomed!’ He said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said: ‘I had intercourse with my wife whilst I was fasting.’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked: ‘Could you find a slave you could set free?’ He said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Are you able to fast for two consecutive months?’ He said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Can you feed sixty poor persons?’ He said, ‘No.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fell silent. Whilst we were (sitting) like that, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was brought a container of dates. He said, ‘Where is the one who was asking?’ The man said, ‘I (am here).’ He said, ‘Take these and give them in charity.’ The man said, ‘Who is poorer than I, O Messenger of Allaah? There is no household between the two lava fields (i.e., in Madeenah) that is poorer than my household.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) smiled until his back teeth could be seen, then he said: ‘Feed it to your family.’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, 1936). According to a report narrated by Ahmad from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sitting in the shade of the fortress of Hassaan, a man came to him and said, “I have been burnt, O Messenger of Allaah!” He asked, “What is wrong with you?” He said, “I had intercourse with my wife whilst I was fasting.” She [‘Aa’ishah] said: that was in Ramadaan. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “Sit down,” so he sat down at the back of the gathering. Then a man came with a donkey on whose back was a basket of dates, and said: “This is my sadaqah (charity) O Messenger of Allaah.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Where is the burnt one who just came?” He said: “Here I am, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: “Take this and give it in charity.” He said, “Where should it go except to me and my family, O Messenger of Allaah? By Him Who sent you with the truth, I cannot find anything for me and my family.” He said: “Take it.” So he took it. (al-Musnad 6/276). We ask Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, to forgive us our sins and transgressions and to accept our repentance, for He is the Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We thank you for sending this question in an effort to find the right answer instead of merely accepting what you have heard from someone who claims to be a Muslim. The ummah (Muslim nation) is agreed that the Messengers are infallible in carrying out their mission they do not forget anything that Allaah has revealed to them except with regard to matters that have been abrogated. They are also infallible in conveying the Message they do not conceal anything that Allaah has revealed to them, for that would be a betrayal and it is impossible to imagine that they could do such a thing. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not ,then you have not conveyed His Message [al-Maaidah 5:67]. If anything is concealed or changed, then the punishment of Allaah will befall the one who is guilty of doing these things, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And if he [Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] had forged a false saying concerning Us [Allaah], We surely would have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off his life artery (aorta). [al-Haqqah 69:44-46]. One aspect of infallibility is that they (the Prophets) do not forget anything of that which Allaah has revealed to them, and thus no part of the revelation is lost. [Al-rusul wal-risaalaat (The Messengers and their missions), Omar al-Ashqar, p. 97] Omar al-Ashqar also said (op. cit., p.102): The Prophets and Messengers may also strive to find the right judgement in the situations with which they are faced, and they judge according to what they themselves see and hear they do not have knowledge of the Unseen. They may make an incorrect judgement, as happened to the Prophet of Allaah Dawood (David), who failed to do so, and Allaah helped his son Sulaymaan (Solomon) to come up with the right answer in that particular case. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: There were two women, each of whom had a son. A wolf came and carried off the son of one of them, who said to the other, The wolf has taken your son. The other said, No, he took your son. They came to Dawood to ask him to judge between them, and he ruled in favour of the older woman. Then they went to Sulaymaan the son of Dawood and told him what had happened. He said, Bring a knife and divide the child between them. The younger woman said, Do not do that, may Allaah have mercy on you! He is her son. So Sulaymaan ruled in favour of the younger woman. (Reported by al-Bukhaari). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained this story: Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) narrated that he heard a dispute going on at the door of his apartment, so he went out and told them: I am no more than a human being. Disputing parties may come to me, and one of you may be more eloquent and persuasive than the other, so I may think that he is telling the truth and rule in favour of him. Whoever has a judgement in favour of him to the detriment of a fellow-Muslims rights, this is a piece of the Fire let him take it or leave it. When it comes to the idea of the Prophets committing major sins (kabaair), Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said (in al-Fataawaa, 4/319): The belief that the Prophets are free of major sins, but not of minor sins, is the opinion of the majority of Islamic scholars and of all (Muslim) groups It is the opinion of most mufassireen (commentators on the Quran), scholars of hadeeth and fuqaha (jurists). With regard to whether it is possible for the Prophets to commit minor sins, in Lawaami al-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (2/214), al-Safaareeni quoted from Ibn Hamdaan who said in Nihaayat al-Mubtadieen: They are infallible in conveying the commands and message of Allaah, but they are not infallible in any other regard. They may make mistakes, forget things, or commit minor sins according to the most well-known opinion (of the scholars) but they will not be approved for these mistakes. The majority of scholars take the following as evidence to support their claim that the Prophets are not free from minor sins: Adams sin in eating from the tree from which Allaah had forbidden him to eat. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And (remember) when We said to the angels, Prostrate yourselves to Adam. They prostrated (all) except Iblees (Satan), who refused. Then We said, O Adam! Verily, this is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let him not get you both out of Paradise, so that you be distressed in misery. Verily, you have (a promise from Us) that you will never be hungry therein nor naked. And you (will) suffer not from thirst therein nor from the suns heat. Then Shaytaan whispered to him, saying: O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that shall never waste away? Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts appeared to them, and they began to stick on themselves leaves from Paradise for their covering. Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray. [Ta-Ha 20:116-121] When Nooh prayed for his kaafir son, Allaah rebuked him for doing so, and taught him that this person was not a member of his family, and that this prayer was not a righteous deed on his part. So Nooh sought forgiveness from his Lord, repented and returned to Allaah: Nooh said: O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers. [Hood 11:47 interpretation of the meaning]. When Dawood realized that he had been too quick to judge, without listening to what the second disputant had to say, he hastened to repent: and he sought Forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allaah) in repentance. [Saad 38:24 interpretation of the meaning]. Everyone, even the Prophets, is in need of the forgiveness of Allaah. Allaah has blessed His Prophets by forgiving their sins, and He has blessed our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as He said (interpretation of the meaning): That Allaah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future, and complete His favour upon you, and guide you on the Straight Path. [al-Fath 48:2] Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, in al-Fataawaa 10/296, Concerning the issue of forgiveness of the Prophets sins: Allaah, may He be exalted, does not speak of any Prophet in the Quraan, except He also mentions repentance and seeking forgiveness. For example, Adam and his wife said: Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers. [al-Araaf 7:23 interpretation of the meaning]. Nooh said: O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers. [Hood 11:47 interpretation of the meaning]. Ibraaheem said: Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and (all) the Believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established. [Ibraaheem 14:41 interpretation of the meaning] and You are our wali (Protector), so forgive us and have Mercy on us, for You are the Best of those who forgive. And ordain for us good in this world, and in the Hereafter. Certainly we have turned unto You [al-Araaf 7:155-156 interpretation of the meaning]. Moosa said: You are our wali (Protector), so forgive us and have Mercy on us, for You are the Best of those who forgive. [al-Araaf 7:155 interpretation of the meaning]. Then he [Ibn Taymiyah, may Allaah have mercy on him] gave further examples, but what we have mentioned here is sufficient. And Allaah knows best.\n",

This is the consensus of the fuqaha. Ibn al-Qayyim said that names which belong only to Allah include : al-Ahad (the One), al-Samad (the Eternal), al-Khaliq (the Creator), al-Razzaq (the Provider), al-Jabbar (the Compeller), al-Mutakabbir (the Majestic), al-Awwal (the First), al-Akhir (the Last), al-Batin (the Hidden) and Allam al-Ghuyub (the Knower of the Unseen). (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 98) The evidence that it is forbidden to call anyone by a name which belongs only to Allah, such as Malik al-Muluk (king of kings), may be seen for example in the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him); in the version narrated by al-Bukhari, he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The most despised name with Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man called Malik al-Muluk. According to Muslim, he said, The man who will be most deserving of Allah’s anger and most evil on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who was called Malik al-Amlak. There is no King except Allah. As regards using names that may be used for Allah or for others, it is permissible to use these names, such as ‘Ali (High), Rashid (Guide) and Badi’ (Innovator or Originator). Ibn ‘Abidin said: “It seems to be the case that they are permitted, even if the definite article “al” is used. Al-Hasqafi said: What (these names) mean concerning us (human beings) is different from their meanings concerning Allah, may He be exalted. Names which befit no one except the Prophet It is forbidden to use names which befit no one except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as Sayyid Walad Adam (master of the sons of Adam), Sayyid al-Nas (master of mankind), Sayyid al-Kull (master of all), because these names, as the Hanbalis said, befit no one except him, (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Names which imply enslavement to anything besides Allah It is forbidden to use any name which implies enslavement to anything besides Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, such as ‘Abd al-’Uzza (slave of al-’Uzza a pagan goddess), ‘Abd al-Ka’bah (slave of the Ka’bah), ‘Abd al-Dar (slave of the House), ‘Abd ‘Ali (slave of ‘Ali), ‘Abd al-Husayn (slave of Husayn), etc. It was stated in Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin that one should not be called ‘Abd Fulan (slave of so-and-so). It says in Kashshaf al-Qina’: ‘They (the scholars) agreed that every name which implies enslavement to anything other than Allah is forbidden, such as ‘Abd al-’Uzza, ‘Abd ‘Amr, ‘Abd ‘Ali, ‘Abd al-Ka’bah, and any other similar names, such as ‘Abd al-Nabi (slave of the Prophet), ‘Abd al-Husayn, ‘Abd al-Masih (slave of the Messiah).” (Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin, 5/268;Mughni al-Muhtaj, 4/295; Tuhfat al-Muhtaj, 10/373; Kashshaf al-Qina’, 3/27; Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 90) The evidence that it is forbidden to use any name which implies enslavement to anything other than Allah may be seen in the report of Ibn Abi Shaybah from Yazid ibn al-Miqdam ibn Shurayh, from his father, from his grandfather Hani ibn Yazid, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: A delegation came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he heard them calling someone ‘Abd al-Hajar (slave of the stone). He asked him, What is your name? and he said, ‘Abd al-Hajar. He said, No, you are ‘Abd-Allah (the slave of Allah). (Al-Mawsu’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 11/335) Using names of idols Using the names of idols that are worshipped instead of Allah. Names of devils It is forbidden to use the names of devils (shayatin), such as Khanzab and Iblis. It was reported that the Sunnah is to change names such as these. Disliked names in Islam Names that are makruh (disliked) may be categorized as follows: Names that have bad or distasteful meanings It is makruh to use names that have bad or distasteful meanings, or which sound odd, which would cause others to mock a person or would cause him embarrassment, in addition to being contrary to the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who taught us to choose good names. Names whose meanings are too soft and provocative or sexy It is makruh to use names whose meanings are too soft and provocative or sexy, which is a widespread problem in the naming of girls. Naming someone after promiscuous actors and singers It is makruh to deliberately name someone after promiscuous actors and singers who star in worthless entertainment shows. One of the signs of empty-headedness and lack of pride in one's faith is the fact that after a show starring immoral women, people will compete with one another in naming their newborns after these women. Anyone who checks the names registered at the time of one of these shows will see that this is a fact. And our complaining is to Allah. Names that convey any sense of sin It is makruh to use names that convey any sense of sin and disobedience to Allah. Foreign names that belong only to the unbelievers It is makruh to use foreign names that belong only to the unbelievers. The proud Muslim who is content with his religion will avoid this and not come anywhere near it. The temptation to use these names is very strong in our time, and a Muslim might pick up any name from Europe and America. This is the worst type of sin and a sign of humiliation and defeat. If this imitation of the unbelievers and using their names is merely the matter of whims and stupidity, it is nevertheless a major sin; if it is done because one actually believes these names are better than Muslim names, then this is a devastating blow to the foundation of faith. In either case, the person who has done this must hasten to repent, and changing the name is a condition of repentance. Names of Pharaohs or other tyrants It is makruh to use the names of Pharaohs or other tyrants. Names that have any undesirable meaning It is makruh to use names that have any undesirable meaning. Naming people after animals It is makruh to name people after animals that are known for their bad qualities. When the Arabs called their children by such names, it was because of good qualities that they noticed in them, and this was the desired meaning. So when they used the name Kalb (dog), it was because of the dogs alertness and ability to work hard; when they used the name Himar (donkey), it was because of the donkeys patience and forbearance, and so on This refutes the false arguments of the Shu’ubiyyah against the Arabs, as was explained by Ibn Durayd, Ibn Faris, and others. Names which are composed of any word added to such words as al-Din or Islam It is makruh to use any name which is composed of any word added to such words as al-Din (the Religion) or Islam, such as Nur al-Din/Nuruddin (Light of the Religion), Diya al-Din/Ziauddin (Brightness of the Religion), Sayf al-Islam (Sword of Islam), Nur al-Islam (Light of Islam), etc. This is because of the great status attached to these words, al-Din and Islam. Adding words to them to form names is an exaggeration which borders on lying, which is why some scholars said that this is haram, and the majority say that it is makruh, because it gives an incorrect impression which should not be given. The way this practice started was that these were titles which were added to people’s names, then people started to use them as names. Names of this sort may be forbidden for two reasons. In a name such as Shihab al-Din, for example, the word Shihab means a flame, which comes from fire, then this is added to the word al-Din (which is inappropriate). This can lead to the use of strange names, as in Indonesia, where people use names such as Dhahab al-Din (gold of the Religion) and Mas al-Din (diamond of the Religion)! Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), used to dislike being called by his nickname Muhiy al-Din, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) used to dislike being called by his nickname Taqiy al-Din, and he said, But my family gave me this nickname, so I am known by it. Names which include the word al-Rasul Names which include the word al-Rasul (the Messenger) are also makruh. Names of angels Some of the scholars regarded using the names of angels (peace be upon them) as makruh. Giving angels’ names to women is clearly haram, because it implies imitation of the mushrikin, who thought that the angels were the daughters of Allah, Exalted be He above what they say! Names of Surahs of the Quran Some of the scholars thought that it was makruh to give people the names of Surahs of the Quran, such as Ta-Ha, Ya-Sin, Ha-Mim. (The popular notion that Ya-Sin and Ta-Ha are names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not correct).

      "Praise be to Allah.Combining acts of worship is of two types: One type is not correct, which is in the case of acts of worship which are independent or are part of another. In these cases, intentions cannot be combined. For example, if a man misses the Sunnah of Fajr, and the sun comes up and the time for Salaat al-Duhaa comes, the Sunnah of Fajr cannot take the place of Salaat al-Duhaa, or vice-versa. They cannot be combined, because the Sunnah of Fajr is independent, and Salaat al-Duhaa is independent, and neither of them can take the place of the other. The same applies if an act is connected to the one that comes before it – they cannot be combined. So if a man says, “I want to have the intention of praying both fard and sunnah when I pray Fajr,” we would tell him that this is not correct, because the Sunnah (of Fajr) is directly connected to the Fard, and cannot take its place. The second type is where what is intended is not a specific act of worship. In this case, intentions may be combined. For example: a man enters the mosque where the people are praying Salaat al-Fajr. It is known that when a man enters the mosque, he should not sit down until he prays two rak’ahs, so if he joins the imaam in that prayer, this is good enough. Why? Because the point is that he should pray two rak’ahs when he enters the mosque. Similarly, if a man enters the mosque at the time of Salaat al-Duhaa and prays two rak’ahs with the intention of praying Salaat al-Duhaa, he does not have to pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid as well, but if he has the intention of both, that is better. This is the guideline for combining acts of worship. In the case of fasting, fasting the Day of ‘Arafaah, for example, means that when this day comes you will be fasting, whether you intended it as one of the three days which you fast every month or as the Day of ‘Arafaah. But if you intended it as the Day of ‘Arafaah, it will not count as one of the three days; but if you intended it as one of the three days, that is good enough and will count as the Day of ‘Arafaah too. If you intended both, that is preferable.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The skins of animals that become halaal through proper slaughter are pure (taahir), because they become good through the process of proper slaughter, such as the skins of camels, cattle, sheep, gazelles, rabbits and so on, whether they are tanned or not tanned. As for the skins of animals whose meat we cannot eat, such as dogs, wolves, lions, elephants and the like, it is impure (naajis), whether it is slaughtered or it dies or is killed, because even if it is slaughtered it does not become halaal and cannot be good, so it is naajis, whether it is tanned or not tanned. This is according to the most correct opinion, because the most correct opinion is that impure skins cannot be made pure through tanning if they come from animals which we are not permitted to slaughter for food. As for the skins of animals which have died before they could be slaughtered properly, if these are tanned then they become pure, but before they are tanned they are impure. So now animal skins may be divided into three types: The first type: those which are pure whether they are tanned or not, which are the skins of animals that may be eaten if they are slaughtered correctly. The second type: skins which cannot be pure either before or after tanning, because they are impure. These are the skins of animals whose meat we cannot eat, like pigs. The third type: skins which become pure after tanning, but are not pure before before tanning. These are the skins of animals whose meat may be eaten if they are slaughtered properly but not if they die otherwise.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.When a man enters upon his wife for the first time, he should take her forelock in his hand and say: “Allaahumma innee as’aluka khayrahaa wa khayra ma jabaltahaa ‘alayh, wa a’oodhu bika min sharrihaa wa sharri ma jabaltahaa ‘alayh (O Allaah, I ask You for the goodness within her and the goodness that You have made her inclined towards, and I take refuge with You from the evil within her and the evil that You have made her inclined towards).” (Reported by Abu Dawood, no. 2160; Ibn Maajah, no. 1918), But if he fears that the woman may get upset if he takes hold of her forelock and recites this du’aa’, then he can take hold of her forelock as if he is going to kiss her, and recite this du’aa’ to himself under his breath, without letting her hear him, so that she will not be upset. If she is a woman who has knowledge, she will know that this is prescribed by Islam and that there is nothing wrong with him doing and saying this in such a way that she can hear it. As for praying two rak’ahs when he enters the room where his wife is, it was reported that some of the salaf did this, so if the man does this it is good, and if he does not do it, there is nothing wrong with that. As for reciting al-Baqarah and other soorahs, I know of no basis for doing this.\n",

      "Contents Related What is Zamzam? Virtues of drinking from the water of Zamzam How to drink Zamzam water Can you take Zamzam water back to your country? Praise be to Allah.What is Zamzam? Zamzam is the name of a famous well in al-Masjid al-Haram [the Sacred Mosque in Makkah], which is thirty-eight cubits away from the Ka`bah. It is the well of Isma’il, the son of Ibrahim (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both), from which Allah quenched the thirst of Isma’il when he was an infant. His mother looked for water for him, but could not find any. She climbed to the top of al-Safa, praying to Allah to help her and give her water for Isma’il, then she climbed to the top of al-Marwah and did the same. Allah sent Jibril, and he struck the earth with his heels, and water appeared. Virtues of drinking from the water of Zamzam The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) agreed that it is recommended for pilgrims on Hajj and `Umrah in particular, and for all Muslims in general, to drink Zamzam water, because of the authentic hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is reported to have drunk the water of Zamzam . (Al-Bukhari, 3/492) According to the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the water of Zamzam, “It is a blessing, and it is food that satisfies.” (Reported by Muslim, 4/1922). Al-Tayaalisi (61) added, in a version that he narrated: “and a cure for the sick.” I.e., drinking the water of Zamzam means that a person does not need to eat, and it will cure his sickness – but this is when he drinks it with faith and sincerity, as proven in the hadith of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari who stayed in Makkah for a month without any nourishment except Zamzam water. Al-`Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “The people used to compete over Zamzam during the time of Jahiliyyah. People who had children used to bring them and give them to drink, and this was their early-morning victuals. We used to used to think that it was a help for people who had children.” Al-'Abbas said: “During the Jahiliyyah, Zamzam was known as Shaba’ah (satisfaction).” Al-‘Allamah al-Abbi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “(The water) is for whatever purpose it is drunk for, and Allah made it food and drink for Isma’il and his mother Hajar .” Ibn al-Mubarak entered Zamzam and said, “O Allah, Ibn al-Mu’ammal told me, from Abu’l-Zubayr from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for,’ so, O Allah, I am drinking it (to quench) my thirst on the Day of Resurrection.” The two angels washed the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was a child, after they had taken it out, then they put it back. Al-Hafiz al-'Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “The reason why the Prophet’s chest was washed with Zamzam water was to make him stronger so that he could see the kingdom of heaven and earth, and Paradise and Hell, because one of the special qualities of Zamzam is that it strengthens the heart and calms the soul. The report about the chest of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) being washed with the water of Zamzam is proven in the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “My roof was opened when I was in Makkah, and Jibril (peace be upon him) came down and opened my chest, then he washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith, poured it into my chest, and closed it up again. Then he took me by the hand and ascended with me into the first heaven.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3/429) How to drink Zamzam water It is sunnah to drink one’s fill of Zamzam water and to quench one’s thirst. The jurists have mentioned the etiquette that is recommended when drinking Zamzam water, such as facing the Ka`bah , saying Bismillah, pausing to take a breath three times, drinking one’s fill, praising Allah after one finishes, and sitting whilst drinking it, as one should do when drinking other kinds of drinks. As regards the hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said, “I gave the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Zamzam water to drink whilst he was standing,” (reported by al-Bukhari, 3/492), it is taken to mean that it is permissible to drink whilst standing, and the disapproval of doing so is understood to mean that it is disliked. The scholars also recommended that the person who drinks Zamzam water should sprinkle some of it on his head, face and chest, make lots of du`a when drinking it, and to drink it for a purpose that will benefit him in this world or the next, because of the hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for.” (Reported by Ibn Majah, 2/1018; see Al-Maqasid al-Hasanah by al-Sakhawi, p. 359) When Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) drank from the water of Zamzam, he said: “O Allah, I ask you for beneficial knowledge, plentiful provision and healing from every disease.” Al-Daynuri reported that al-Humaydi said: “We were with Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah, and he told us the hadith about the water of Zamzam being drunk for whatever purpose it is drunk for. A man got up and left the gathering, then he came back and said, ‘O Abu Muhammad, is the hadith which you told us about the water of Zamzam sahih?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ The man said, ‘Just now I drank a bucket of Zamzam so that you would tell me one hundred hadiths.’ Sufyan said, ‘Sit down,’ so he sat down and he told him one hundred hadiths.” Can you take Zamzam water back to your country? Some jurists recommended that people should take some Zamzam water back with them to their countries, because it is a cure for those who seek healing. `Aishah reported that she took Zamzam water home with her in bottles, and said, “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took some of it away with him, and he used to pour it on the sick and give it to them to drink.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 4/37) The jurists agreed that it is permissible to use Zamzam water to purify oneself , but they advised that it should not be used for any inappropriate purposes such as removing impurity and so on. Al-‘Allamah al-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Kashshaf al-Qina’: “Only this (using Zamzam water to remove najasah) is considered to be makruh, out of respect, but it is not makruh to use it to purify oneself, because ‘Ali said: ‘The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) departed (from Muzdalifah) and called for a bucket of Zamzam water. He drank from it, then did wudu. (Reported by ‘Abd-Allah ibn Ahmad with a sahih isnad).” (See Nayl al-Awtar, Kitab al-Taharah, Bab Tahuriyyat al-Bahr). Al-Hafiz al-Sakhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Maqasid al-Hasanah: “Some people said that the virtue (of Zamzam water) remains only so long as it is in its place (of origin), and that when it is taken away, it changes. This is an idea that has no basis. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wrote to Suhayl ibn `Amr: “If my letter reaches you at night, do not wait until morning, and if it reaches you during the day, do not wait until evening, to send me some Zamzam water.” He sent him two containers full, and at that time he was in Madinah, before the Conquest of Makkah. This hadith is hasan because of corroborating evidence. `Aishah also used to take Zamzam water away with her, and she reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do this; he used to carry it in small vessels and buckets, and pour it onto the sick and give it to them to drink. Whenever a guest visited Ibn `Abbas he would honour him by giving him Zamzam to drink. `Ata was asked about taking Zamzam water away, and he said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), al-Hasan and al-Husayn all took it away with them.” And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Benefits of seasons of worship Virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah Reasons behind the virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah Things to avoid in Dhul Hijjah What to do in Dhul Hijjah Praise be to Allah.Benefits of seasons of worship Praise be to Allah Who has created time and has made some times better than others, some months and days and nights better than others, when rewards are multiplied many times, as a mercy towards His slaves. This encourages them to do more righteous deeds and makes them more eager to worship Him, so that the Muslim renews his efforts to gain a greater share of reward, prepare himself for death and supply himself in readiness for the Day of Judgement. This season of worship brings many benefits, such as the opportunity to correct one’s faults and make up for any shortcomings or anything that one might have missed. Every one of these special occasions involves some kind of worship through which the slaves may draw closer to Allah, and some kind of blessing through which Allah bestows His favour and mercy upon whomsoever He will. The happy person is the one who makes the most of these special months, days and hours and draws nearer to his Lord during these times through acts of worship; he will most likely be touched by the blessing of Allah and will feel the joy of knowing that he is safe from the flames of Hell. (Ibn Rajab, al-Lataif, p.8) The Muslim must understand the value of his life, increase his worship of Allah and persist in doing good deeds until the moment of death. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty.\" [al-Hijr 15:99] The commentators said: \"‘The certainty’ means death.\" Virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah Among the special seasons of worship are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah , which Allah has preferred over all the other days of the year. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days.\" The people asked, \"Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?\" He said, \"Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2/457). Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"There is no deed more precious in the sight of Allah, nor greater in reward, than a good deed done during the ten days of Sacrifice .\" He was asked, \"Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?\" He said, \"Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.\" (Reported by al-Darimi, 1/357; its isnad is hasan as stated in al-Irwa, 3/398). These texts and others indicate that these ten days are better than all the other days of the year, with no exceptions, not even the last ten days of Ramadan. But the last ten nights of Ramadan are better, because they include Laylat al-Qadr (\"the Night of Decree\"), which is better than a thousand months. Thus the various reports may be reconciled. (See Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/412). Reasons behind the virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah You should know, my brother in Islam, that the virtue of these ten days is based on many things: Allah swears an oath by them, and swearing an oath by something is indicative of its importance and great benefit. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"By the dawn; by the ten nights\" [al-Fajr 89:1-2]. Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn al-Zubayr, Mujahid and others of the earlier and later generations said that this refers to the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. Ibn Kathir said: \"This is the correct opinion.\" (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 8/413) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) testified that these are the best days of this world, as we have already quoted above from sahih ahadith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged people to do righteous deeds because of the virtue of this season for people throughout the world, and also because of the virtue of the place - for the Hujjaj (pilgrims) to the Sacred House of Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to recite a lot of Tasbih (\"Subhan-Allah\"), Tahmid (\"Al-hamdu Lillah\") and Takbir (\"Allahu akbar\") during this time. ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"There are no days greater in the sight of Allah and in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so during this time recite a great deal of Tahlil (\"La ilaha ill-Allah\"), Takbir and Tahmid.\" (Reported by Ahmad, 7/224; Ahmad Shakir stated that it is sahih). These ten days include Yawm ‘Arafah (the Day of ‘Arafah ), on which Allah perfected His Religion. Fasting on this day will expiate for the sins of two years. These days also include Yawm al-Nahar (the Day of Sacrifice ), the greatest day of the entire year and the greatest day of Hajj , which combines acts of worship in a way unlike any other day. These ten days include the days of sacrifice and of Hajj. Things to avoid in Dhul Hijjah Question: What must the Muslim avoid during these ten days if he wants to offer a sacrifice? The Sunnah indicates that the one who wants to offer a sacrifice must stop cutting his hair and nails and removing anything from his skin, from the beginning of the ten days until after he has offered his sacrifice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"When you see the new moon of Dhul-Hijjah, if any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, then he should stop cutting his hair and nails until he has offered his sacrifice.\" According to another report he said: \"He should not remove (literally, touch) anything from his hair or skin.\" (reported by Muslim with four isnads, 13/146) The Prophet’s instruction here makes one thing obligatory and his prohibition makes another haram, according to the soundest opinion, because these commands and prohibitions are unconditional and unavoidable. However, if a person does any of these things deliberately, he must seek Allah’s forgiveness but is not required to offer (an extra) sacrifice in expiation; his sacrifice will be acceptable. Whoever needs to remove some hair, nails, etc. because it is harming him, such as having a broken nail or a wound in a site where there is hair, should do so, and there is nothing wrong with that. The state of ihram is so important that it is permitted to cut one’s hair if leaving it will cause harm. There is nothing wrong with men or women washing their heads during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only forbade cutting the hair, not washing it. The wisdom behind this prohibition of the one who wants to offer a sacrifice from cutting his hair etc., is so that he may resemble those in ihram in some aspects of the rites performed, and so that he may draw closer to Allah by offering the sacrifice. So he leaves his hair and nails alone until the time when he has offered his sacrifice, in the hope that Allah will save him in his entirety from the Fire. And Allah knows best. If a person has cut his hair or nails during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah because he was not planning to offer a sacrifice, then he decides later, during the ten days, to offer a sacrifice, then he must refrain from cutting his hair and nails from the moment he makes this decision. Some women may delegate their brothers or sons to make the sacrifice on their behalf, then cut their hair during these ten days. This is not correct, because the ruling applies to the one who is offering the sacrifice, whether or not he (or she) delegates someone else to carry out the actual deed. The prohibition does not apply to the person delegated, only to the person who is making the sacrifice, as is indicated in the hadith. The person who is sacrificing on behalf of someone else, for whatever reason, does not have to adhere to this prohibition. This prohibition appears to apply only to the one who is offering the sacrifice, not to his wife and children, unless any of them is offering a sacrifice in his or her own right, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sacrifice \"on behalf of the family of Muhammad,\" but there are no reports that say he forbade them to cut their hair or nails at that time. If a person was planning to offer a sacrifice, then he decides to go and perform Hajj, he should not cut his hair or nails if he wants to enter ihram, because the Sunnah is only to cut hair and nails when necessary. But if he is performing Tamattu’ [whereby he performs ‘Umrah, comes out of ihram and enters ihram anew for Hajj], he should trim his hair at the end of his ‘Umrah because this is part of the ritual. The things that are described above as being prohibited for the person who is planning to offer a sacrifice are reported in the hadith quoted above; the person is not forbidden to wear perfume, have marital relations, wear sewn garments, etc. What to do in Dhul Hijjah Concerning the types of worship to be performed during these ten days, one must understand that these days are a great blessing from Allah to His slave, which is appreciated properly by the actively righteous. It is the Muslim’s duty to appreciate this blessing and make the most of the opportunity, by devoting these ten days to paying more attention to striving hard in worship. Among His blessings to His slaves, Allah has given us many ways in which to do good and worship Him, so that the Muslim may be constantly active and consistent in his worship of his Lord. Among the good deeds which the Muslim should strive to do during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are: 1.Fasting. It is Sunnah to fast on the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do good deeds during this time, and fasting is one of the best of deeds. Allah has chosen fasting for Himself, as is stated in the hadith qudsi: \"Allah says: ‘All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him, except for fasting, which is for Me and I am the One Who will reward him for it.’\" (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1805). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah. It was narrated from Hunaydah ibn Khalid from his wife, that one of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah and the day of ‘Ashura, and three days each month, the first Monday of the month and two Thursdays. Narrated by al-Nasai, 4/205 and by Abu Dawud; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2/462. 2. Takbir . It is Sunnah to say Takbir (\"Allahu akbar\"), Tahmid (\"Al-hamdu Lillah\"), Tahlil (\"La ilaha ill-Allah\") and Tasbih (\"Subhan Allah\") during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, and to say it loudly in the mosque, the home, the street and every place where it is permitted to remember Allah and mention His name out loud, as an act of worship and as a proclamation of the greatness of Allah, may He be exalted. Men should recite these phrases out loud, and women should recite them quietly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"That they might witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e., reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade, etc.), and mention the name of Allah on appointed days, over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice)...\" [al-Hajj 22:28] The majority of scholars agree that the \"appointed days\" are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, because of the words of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father): \"The ‘appointed days’ are the first ten days (of Dhul-Hijjah).\" The Takbir may include the words \"Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah; wa Allahu akbar wa Lillaahi’l-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god but Allah; Allah is Most Great and to Allah be praise),\" as well as other phrases. Takbir at this time is an aspect of the Sunnah that has been forgotten, especially during the early part of this period, so much so that one hardly ever hears Takbir, except from a few people. This Takbir should be pronounced loudly, in order to revive the Sunnah and as a reminder to the negligent. There is sound evidence that Ibn ‘Umar and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to go out in the marketplace during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, reciting Takbir, and the people would recite Takbir when they heard them. The idea behind reminding the people to recite Takbir is that each one should recite it individually, not in unison, as there is no basis in Shari’ah for doing this. Reviving aspects of the Sunnah that have been virtually forgotten is a deed that will bring an immense reward, as is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \"Whoever revives an aspect of my Sunnah that is forgotten after my death, he will have a reward equivalent to that of the people who follow him, without it detracting in the least from their reward.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 7/443; this is a hasan hadith because of corroborating asanid). 3.Performing Hajj and ‘Umrah. One of the best deeds that one can do during these ten days is to perform Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah. The one whom Allah helps to go on Hajj to His House and to perform all the rituals properly is included in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): \"An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.\" 4.Doing more good deeds in general, because good deeds are beloved by Allah and will bring a great reward from Him. Whoever is not able to go to Hajj should occupy himself at this blessed time by worshipping Allah, praying (salah), reading Quran, remembering Allah, making supplication (du’a), giving charity, honouring his parents, upholding the ties of kinship, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and other good deeds and acts of worship. 5.Sacrifice. One of the good deeds that will bring a person closer to Allah during these ten days is offering a sacrifice, by choosing a high-quality animal and fattening it, and spending money for the sake of Allah. (more information to follow, in sha Allah). 6.Sincere repentance . One of the most important things to do during these ten days is to repent sincerely to Allah and to give up all kinds of disobedience and sin. Repentance means coming back to Allah and foregoing all the deeds, open and secret, that He dislikes, out of regret for what has passed, giving it up immediately and being determined never to return to it, but to adhere firmly to the Truth by doing what Allah loves. If a Muslim commits a sin, he must hasten to repent at once, without delay, firstly because he does not know when he will die, and secondly because one evil deed leads to another. Repentance at special times is very important because in most cases people’s thoughts turn towards worship at these times, and they are keen to do good, which leads to them recognizing their sins and feeling regret for the past. Repentance is obligatory at all times, but when the Muslim combines sincere repentance with good deeds during the days of most virtue, this is a sign of success, in sha Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"But as for him who repented, believed and did righteous deeds, then he will be among those who are successful.\" [al-Qasas 28:67] The Muslim should make sure that he does not miss any of these important occasions, because time is passing quickly. Let him prepare himself by doing good deeds which will bring him reward when he is most in need of it, for no matter how much reward he earns, he will find it is less than he needs; the time of departure is at hand, the journey is frightening, delusions are widespread, and the road is long, but Allah is ever watchful, and to Him will we return and render account. As the Quran says (interpretation of the meaning): \"So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it, And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.\" [al-Zalzalah 99:7-8] There is much to be gained, so make the most of the opportunity afforded by these invaluable and irreplaceable ten days. Hasten to do good works, before death strikes, before one can regret one’s negligence and failure to act, before one is asked to return to a place where no prayers will be answered, before death intervenes between the hopeful one and the things he hopes for, before you are trapped with your deeds in the grave. O you whose hard heart is as dark as the night, is it not time that your heart was filled with light and became soft? Expose yourself to the gentle breeze of your Lord’s mercy during these ten days, for Allah will cause this breeze to touch whomever He wills, and whoever is touched by it will be happy on the Day of Judgement. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and all his Family and Companions. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Should the wife serve her husband? Evidence for the view that it is a woman’s duty to serve her husband Praise be to Allah.Should the wife serve her husband? The more correct view in this matter is that stated by a number of scholars, such as Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, Abu Ishaq al-Jawzjani and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on them), who said that it is the woman’s duty to serve her husband within the bounds of what is reasonable and as other women who are like her serve husbands who are like him. She also has to take care of the house, doing things like cooking and so on, in accordance with what is customary among people like her and her husband. This differs according to circumstances, time and place, hence Ibn Taymiyah said: This varies according to circumstances. What the Bedouin wife has to do is not the same as what the urban wife has to do. Evidence for the view that it is a woman’s duty to serve her husband The evidence for this more correct opinion is: the Hadith of al-Bukhari: Imam al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih that Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her), the daughter of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him for a servant. He said, Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than that? When you go to sleep, say Subhan-Allah (Glory be to Allah) thirty three times, Al-Hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah) thirty three times, and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great) thirty four times. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, part 9/506) Al-Tabari said, in his commentary on this Hadith: “We may understand from this Hadith that every woman who is able to take care of her house by making bread, grinding flour and so on, should do so. It is not the duty of the husband if it is the custom for women like her to do this themselves.” What we learn from the Hadith is that when Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked her father (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for a servant, he did not command her husband to find her a servant or hire someone to do these tasks, or to do these tasks himself. If it were Ali’s duty to do these things, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have commanded him to do them. The Hadith of Asma bint Abi Bakr Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih that Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I got married to al-Zubayr, and he had no wealth on earth and no slaves, nothing except a camel for bringing water and his horse. I used to feed his horse and bring water, and I used to sew patches on the bucket. I made dough but I was not good at baking bread, so my (female) neighbours among the Ansar used to bake bread for me, and they were sincere women. I used to bring date pits from al-Zubayr’s land that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had given to him, carrying them on my head. This land was two-thirds of a farsakh away. One day I came, carrying the date pits on my head, and I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who had a group of the Ansar with him. He called me and made his camel kneel down for me to ride behind him, but I felt too shy to go with the men, and I remembered al-Zubayr and his jealousy, for he was the most jealous of people. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) realized that I felt shy, so he moved on. I came to al-Zubayr and told him, I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when I was carrying date pits on my head, and he had a group of his Companions with him. He made his camel kneel down for me to ride with him, but I remembered your jealousy. He said, By Allah, it bothers me more that you have to carry the date pits than that you should ride with him. Asma said: After that, Abu Bakr sent me a servant to take care of the horse, and it was as if I had been liberated from slavery. (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 9/319). In the commentary on the Hadith of Asma, it says: “From this incident we may understand that it is the woman's duty to take care of everything that her husband needs her to take care of. This was the opinion of Abu Thawr. Other fuqaha suggested that Asma did this voluntarily and that she was not obliged to do it.” Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said: “It seems that this incident Asma carrying the date pits to help her husband and other similar incidents were the matter of necessity, namely that her husband al-Zubayr and other Muslim men were preoccupied with jihad and other things that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had commanded them to do, and they did not have time to take care of domestic matters themselves, and could not afford to hire servants to do that for them, and there was no one else who could do that apart from their womenfolk. So the women used to take care of the home and whoever lived in it, so that the men could devote their time to supporting Islam. Then he said (may Allah have mercy on him): What is more likely is that the matter had to do with the customs in that land, for customs may vary in this regard. It seems that what Ibn Hajar said is close to the view of those who say that the wife has to take care of her husband and the home in accordance with the dictates of local custom. Ibn al-Qayyim said, concerning the story of Asma: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Asma with the date pits on her head, and her husband al-Zubayr was with her, he did not tell him that she did not have to serve him, or that this was unfair to her. He approved of her serving him and of all the women among the Sahabah helping their husbands. This is a matter concerning which there is no doubt. The Hadith of Jabir The Shaykh of the Muhaddithin, Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: My father died and left seven daughters, or nine daughters. I married a woman who had been previously married, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me, Did you get married, O Jabir? I said, Yes. He asked, A virgin or a previously-married woman? I said, A previously-married woman. He said, Why not a young woman so you could play and joke with one another? I said, ‘Abd-Allah [the father of Jabir] has died and left behind daughters, and I would not like to bring them someone who is like them, so I got married to a woman who can take care of them. He said, May Allah bless you or Fair enough. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, vol.9/513). The evidence derived from the Hadith of Jabir is that al-Bukhari introduced this Hadith under the heading, Bab ‘awn al-marah zawjaha fi waladih (Chapter: a woman helping her husband with his children). Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said, commenting on this introduction by al-Bukhari: It seems that al-Bukhari derived the idea that a woman should take care of her husband’s children from the fact that the wife of Jabir took care of his sisters; if she should take care of his sisters then it is even more befitting that she should take of his children. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, vol.9/513). We can say that the wife should take care of her husband, as this is more befitting than her taking care of his sisters or his daughters from another wife. We may also understand from this Hadith that what was customary at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was that women did not only take care of their husbands, they also took care of those who were dependent on their husbands and lived in their houses. The evidence that this understanding is correct is the fact that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell Jabir off for his reason for marrying a previously-married woman, which was that she could take care of his sisters. This indicates that the custom among the Muslims at that time dictated that the wife should take care of those who were under her husband’s care, which means that the wife should serve her husband in those matters that are dictated by local custom, because the husband’s right to be served by his wife comes before that of his sisters. ‘Urf (custom) General contracts including marriage contracts should be governed by the customs that are known among the people, and the custom is that the wife should serve her husband and also take care of matters in the home. In some societies, the custom is that the wife should take care of more than the regular domestic matters. Imam al-Qurtubi said, concerning the matter of the wife serving her husband and taking care of the home: This has to do with ‘Urf, which is one of the bases of Shari`ah. The women of the Bedouin and the desert-dwellers serve their husbands, even looking for fresh water and taking care of the animals What happens nowadays is that the wife usually serves her husband and takes care of different matters within the home. There may be a servant to help her with that if her husband can afford it. If the husband knows that the majority of scholars say that it is not obligatory for the wife to serve her husband and take care of the house, I say that one of the benefits of this may be that he will not go to extremes and demand too much of his wife in this regard, and that he will not give her a hard time if she falls short, because what she is doing is not a duty according to the majority of jurists. However, even it is a duty according to some of them and this is what we think is more correct the fact that there is such a difference of opinion means that the husband has to look at what she is doing as something voluntary rather than obligatory, or something in which the scholars differ as to whether it is obligatory, so he should be gentle with her if he sees that she is falling short in this regard, and he should encourage her and help her to do it.

      "Praise be to Allah.Islam is perfect and comprehensive. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “… This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion…” [al-Maa’idah 5:3] “Say [O Muhammad]: ‘What thing is the most great to witness?’ Say: ‘Allaah (the Most Great!) is Witness between me and you; this Qur’aan has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach…” [al-An’aam 6:19] “And We have not sent you [O Muhammad] except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind….” [Saba’ 34:28] Allaah has told the believers that fasting is obligatory (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Observing al-sawm (fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become the pious.” [al-Baqarah 2:183] And Allaah has explained when the fasting should begin and end (interpretation of the meaning): “… and eat and drink until the white thread (light of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your fast till the nightfall…” [al-Baqarah 2:187] This ruling is not addressed to any particular country or type of people; it is a universal law, which also includes the people asked about in the question. Allaah is Merciful and Kind towards His slaves and has prescribed for them ways of ease to help them to do what He has made obligatory. For example, He allows travellers and the sick not to fast during Ramadaan, to save them from hardship, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “The month of Ramadaan in which was revealed the Qur’aan, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe fasting that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe sawm (fasts( must be made up] from other days…” [al-Baqarah 2:185] So every responsible adult Muslim who is present when Ramadaan comes is obliged to fast, no matter whether the day is short or long. If a person is unable to complete a day’s fast, and fears that he may die or become ill, he is permitted to eat just enough to keep his strength up and keep himself safe from harm, then he should stop eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and he has to make up the days he has missed later on, when he is able to fast.

But if he knows that it is a trust between him and Allaah, and that Allaah is always watching him, so he pays attention to the fact that his Lord is watching him in this work, so that what he takes as wages will be halaal beyond a doubt, then he will have the reward for this sincerity, even if his intention is that nothing should be docked from his pay and so on.

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to call upon anyone other than Allaah, whether at times of ease or times of hardship, no matter how great the status of the one who is called upon, even if he is a Prophet who is close to Allaah, or one of the angels, because du’aa’ is a form of worship. It was narrated from al-Nu’maan ibn Basheer that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Du’aa’ is worship,” then he recited (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Lord said: ‘Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!’” [Ghaafir 40:60] Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2895; Ibn Maajah, 3818; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2370. Worship is due only to Allaah; it is not permitted to direct worship towards anyone else. Hence the Muslims are agreed that whoever calls upon anyone other than Allaah is a mushrik (polytheist, one who associates others with Allaah). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: Whoever regards the angels and Prophets as intermediaries whom he calls upon, puts his trust in and asks them to bring that which will benefit him and ward off harmful things, such as asking them to forgive sins, guide them, relieve them of distress and meet their needs, is a kaafir, according to the consensus of the Muslims. Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 1/124. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The kinds of shirk include asked the dead for one's needs, or seeking their help, or turning to them. This is the essence of shirk. Fath al-Majeed, p. 145 Hence Allaah has said that there is no one more astray than the one who calls on others besides Him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allaah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them? And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping” [al-Ahqaaf 46:5-6] How can he call on others besides Allaah, when Allaah has told us that they are helpless? Allaah says: “And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over thedate stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the All‑Knower (of everything)” [Faatir 35:13-14] Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan Aal al-Shaykh said: Allaah tells us the situation of those who are called upon instead of Him, of the angels, Prophets, idols, etc. in a manner that indicates their helplessness and weakness, and that they lack the abilities that are to be expected in the one who is called upon, such as sovereignty, the ability to hear the call and the ability to respond. Fath al-Majeed, p. 158 How can the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) be called upon, when Allaah has commanded him to say, “Say: ‘It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path’” [al-Jinn 72:21 – interpretation of the meaning]? And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If you ask, then ask of Allaah, and if you seek help, then seek the help of Allaah.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2516; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2043. Hence there can be no doubt that it is a mistake to praise the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the words “O most noble of creation, I have nobody to turn to except you when calamity strikes.” The major scholars have denounced this as being wrong. Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his footnotes to the book Fath al-Majeed, commenting on the poem Burdat al-Busayri from which these words are taken: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us, according to the report narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, ‘Do not praise me as the Christians praised ‘Eesa ibn Maryam, I am the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’ Rather the way to venerate him and love him is by following his Sunnah and establishing his religion and rejecting all the myths that the ignorant attribute to him. But most of the people do not do this, and they occupy themselves with this exaggeration and praise which leads them to commit major shirk.” Fath al-Majeed, p. 155 Moreover, it is not known that even a single Sahaabi used to seek the help of the Messenger or call upon the Messenger, neither was that transmitted from any of the respectable scholars. It is only one of the myths of the deviant. If something troubles you, then say Yaa Allaah, for He is the One Who answers prayers, relieves distress and controls all things.

      "Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to raise his hands for takbeerat al-ihram (the takbeer at the beginning of the prayer), sometimes whilst saying the takbeer, sometimes after it and sometimes before. (al-Bukhaari and al-Nisaa’i) When he had finished reciting Qur’aan, he would pause for a moment then raise his hands, say takbeer and do rukoo’. (Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), p. 128). He used to raise his hands when he stood up from rukoo’ (reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and this raising of the hands is mutawaatir (reported by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). It is the opinion of the majority of scholars and of some of the Hanafis. (Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by al-Albaani, p. 136). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say takbeer when he got up for the third rak’ah (reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim), and he would raise his hands sometimes when he said this takbeer. (al-Bukhaari and Abu Dawood). (Sifat Salaat al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), p. 177). Raising the hands in prayer was a well-known practice among the companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

Ibn al-Qayyim said: “Look at the practice at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Sahaabah after him. They used to raise their hands in prayer when doing rukoo’, and when standing up again. And in the time of the Sahaabah, if ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar saw someone not raising his hands in prayer, he would throw a stone at him. [next phrase is unclear]. (I’laam al-Muwaqqi’een, 2/376). So what is proven in the Sunnah with regard to raising the hands in prayer is that they should be raised at four points in the prayer: when pronouncing takbeerat al-ihraam, when doing rukoo’, when standing up from rukoo’, and after standing up from the first tashahhud. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Jareer ibn Abdullaah said: \"I asked the Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) about an accidental glance at a woman. He commanded me to turn my gaze away.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. See al-Sunan, 2700). Commenting on this hadeeth, al-Mubaarakpoori said: \" Accidental means that his gaze fell on a non-mahram woman unintentionally. He commanded me to turn my gaze away means that he was not to look a second time, because the first glance was not by choice and would be forgiven, but any further glances would be counted as sin, and he should heed the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) [al-Noor 24:30]\" The Messenger of Allaah (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"O Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2701; see Saheeh al-Jaami, 7953) In al-Tuhfah, he said: \"The words do not follow a glance with another mean do not look again after the first glance. You will be forgiven for the first means that you will be forgiven if the first glance was unintentional, and but not for the second means that because the second glance was by choice, it will be counted against you.\" So it is clear that deliberately looking at a non-mahram woman and continuing to look after a first accidental glance is haraam. It is forbidden to look at any part of her body, whether you think she is beautiful or not, whether it provokes sexual desire or not, whether it is accompanied by evil thoughts or not, and whether it leads to immoral deeds or not. We ask Allaah to protect you and us from all haraam deeds. Allaah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Some of Allaahs names are also suitable for human beings and it is permissible to use them, so long as one distinguishes between the meaning applied to the Creator and the meaning applied to the created being, such as Kareem (generous), Lateef (kind), Shaheed (witness), Hakeem (wise), etc. Other Divine names may not be given to human beings because they are befitting only for Allaah, such as al-Baari (the Creator), al-Raaziq (the Provider), al-Muhyi (the Giver of Life), al-Awwal (the First), al-Aakhir (the Last), etc. If your name is of the first type, then there is nothing wrong with it. If it is of the second type, then putting the word \"Abd\" (slave of) in front of the name will solve the problem. May Allaah help us to adhere to the truth. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. First of all, we should realize that there is no contradiction between our belief that Allaah has decreed everything, and our belief that He has given us free will which enables us to do things. Confirming the free will of His slaves, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"To whomsoever among you wills to walk straight\" [al-Takweer 81:28] Our will operates within the will of Allaah, not outside of it, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"But you cannot will, unless Allaah wills…\" [al-Insaan 76:30] Thus it is not permitted to try to cancel one idea out with the other, or to deny either of them. Allaah has confirmed both, that man has the power to choose, and that nothing can operate outside of His Will, may He be glorified. If we apply this to the question asked, we will see that man has freedom of will through which he can choose whichever woman he wishes to marry, and that whatever choice he makes has already been decreed by Allaah. The man’s choice is the means by which he gets what he wants, but some obstacles may come between the person and what he wants, in which case he will realize that Allaah has not decreed this for him, for some reason which is known to Him. Everything that Allaah does is good, and His slaves do not have knowledge of the Unseen or of how things will end. A person may regret missing out on something when it is good that he did not have it, or he may hate something that happens to him when it is good that it happened to him, as Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): \"… it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know.\" [al-Baqarah 2:216] May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This question requires that we offer advice to both of you. Firstly, to your father, who you say is preventing you from marrying this girl whom you describe as religious and well-mannered. He has to allow you to marry her, unless he has some legitimate Islamic reason, which he should explain to you to convince you and put your mind at rest. He should also put himself in your shoes: if his own father prevented him from marrying a religious and well-mannered girl whom he liked, would he not feel resentful about this denial of his freedom? If he would not like his father to do such a thing to him, how can he do this to his son? As the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until he likes for his brother what he likes for himself.” It is not right for your father to prevent you from marrying this girl with no legitimate Islamic reason. If there is a reason, he should explain it to you so that you will understand what is going on. Our advice to you is this: if you can possibly change your mind and find another girl to marry, in order to please your father, maintain family unity and avoid division, then do so. But you may find that you cannot do that, because your heart is attached to this girl, and you cannot bear the thought of marrying anyone else. You may also be afraid that if you choose another girl, your father might object to that marriage too, because some parents may try to force their son to marry a relative, or a woman whose qualities the father likes but the son does not. Some parents may feel jealousy or envy even towards their own children, so they prevent them from doing what they want to do. If this is the case, then there is no sin on you if you marry her, even if your father objects. Perhaps after you are married, your father may change his mind. We ask Allaah to help you make the right choice.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This is a kind of gambling, concerning which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), gambling, al-ansaab (stone altars for making sacrifices to idols, etc.) and al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination)…” [al-Maa’idah 5:90] Gambling means everything that involves one side trying to take advantage of the other, so that one will be the winner and the other will be the loser. This is the shar’i ruling on gambling. So a man who pays 500 riyals every month, for example, may buy books for which his discount adds up to more than a thousand riyals, or he may not buy anything at all. If we suppose that he buys things for which the discount adds up to more than five hundred riyals, then he will be the winner, and the storekeeper will be the loser; if he does not buy anything, then the storekeeper will be the winner and the man will be the loser, because he paid 500 riyals and did not get anything in return. This transaction is a kind of gambling and is not permissible.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Yes, the repentance of a man who does not hope to live for long does count. This applies whether he has an incurable illness such as cancer; or he has been sentenced to death, such as a man who has been brought out for execution, even if the sword is being raised above his head; or a married man who has committed adultery and been sentenced to stoning, even if the stones have already been gathered. His repentance is valid, because Allah accepts the repentance of a man so long as the death rattle has not yet reached his throat. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they to whom Allah will forgive, and Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.” [4:17] The meaning of the phrase “and repent soon afterwards” means that they repent before they die. In the following ayah (verse), Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: ‘Now I repent.’” [ 4:18] There are five essential conditions for repentance: sincerity, regret for what one has done, giving it up immediately, determination not to repeat it in the future, and repenting during the time when repentance will be accepted, i.e., before one dies or before the sun rises in the west.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.People are civil and sociable by nature: they must have friends, and friendship involves visiting one another. When visits are between families, we must pay attention to an important matter which will close the door to evil, by not allowing mixing between the sexes. One of the indications that mixing is haraam is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \" And when you ask (the Prophet's wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts\" [al-Ahzaab 33:53] If we examine the evil results of mixing in family gatherings, we will find many examples of corruption and immorality, for example:In most cases, women's hijaab in mixed gatherings is either non-existant or not correct. These women display the beauty which Allaah has forbidden them to show to anyone before whom they is not allowed to uncover, as it says in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \" and not to reveal their adornment \" [al-Noor 24:31] It even happens that women who adorn themselves in mixed gatherings never adorn themselves for their husbands. When men see women in mixed gatherings, this destroys their religious commitment and morals, and provokes forbidden desires. Terrible arguments and marital separations may result, when one looks at or winks at the wife of another, or they laugh and joke together. When the couple returns home, the settling of accounts begins:Man: \"Why did you laugh at so-and-so's words, when he never said anything funny?Woman: \"And why did you wink at so-and-so?\"Man: \"When he speaks you understand him readily, but when I speak you never understand me!\" So the exchange of accusations goes on, until it ends in hatred or even divorce, in some cases. Some men and women may begin to regret their luck in marriage, when they begin to compare their spouses with those of their friends. A man may say to himself, \"So-and-so joins in discussions and is well-educated, but my wife is ignorant and is not educated at all\" And a woman may say to herself, \"So-and-so is so lucky, her husband is so eloquent and smart, and my husband is so boring and speaks without thinking\" This destroys the marriage relationship and leads to bad treatment on the part of both spouses. Some may show off to others by making false claims about what they do not have, so that one man may issue instructions to his wife in front of other men so that he can pretend to have a strong personality, when at home he is like a tame pussy-cat. A woman may borrow gold so that others in the gathering may think she owns so much, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The one who claims to have what he does not own is as it were wearing a garment of falsehood.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 9/317) These mixed night-time gatherings are often a waste of time, filled with idle gossip and other sins of the tongue, whilst small children are left at home (so that the gathering will not be spoiled by their crying!) These night-time gatherings may become even worse and involve other major sins, such as drinking and gambling, especially among the so-called upper class. Another of the major sins that may result is the desire to follow the kuffaar and be like them in dress and other habits and customs. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever imitates a people is one of them.\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, al-Musnad, 2/50; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 2828) In family gatherings, women should be separated from non-mahram men, and the gatherings should serve some useful purpose, such as remembrance of Allaah (dhikr), seeking beneficial knowledge or discussing social problems or things that can benefit the family in this life. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and healthy. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad. * Translator's note: \"mahram\" refers to a blood-relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden, such as a woman's father, brother, son, uncle, etc.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah is that the imaam should stand in front of the other worshippers, if they are two or more, and no one should stand beside the imaam except in cases of absolute necessity, such as when the mosque is full and he can find nowhere to stand except beside the imaam, in which case there is nothing wrong with it. If there are only two other people and they have to stand beside the imaam, then one should stand to his right and the other to his left. They should not both stand to his right, as was originally prescribed; this was aborgated and the rule now is that they should both stand behind the imaam. Many ordinary peple nowadays think that if two men need to stand with the imaam, they should both be on his right. There is no basis for this idea, but if there is only one man, he should stand only to the right of the imaam, nowhere else.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The first question is: what is the ruling on selling on consignment? This means that a person says, I will sell you these goods – whatever you manage to sell will come under this deal, and whatever you do not sell, I will take back. This transaction in haraam, because it clearly involves an unknown element as neither the vendor nor the purchaser knows how much of the goods will be sold. The issue here is jahaalah (ignorance, not knowing). It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade sales that involve undue risk (gharar) and this is clearly a risky transaction. But if the two sides have to do a deal, then the owner of the goods should give them to the other party to sell them on his behalf, and give him a reward for acting as his agent. This will achieve the aim of both parties, with the latter acting as an agent for the former. There is nothing wrong with this. As for selling goods before they arrive, this is not permitted either, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade selling from the same place where goods are bought before the trader has actually acquired them (lit. added them to his own luggage). He should first take possession of them, then he can sell them. As for selling them when they are in another country, when he does not know if they will arrive intact or not, this is not permitted. If a person were to say that the purchaser is obliged to accept the goods “as is”, whether they are defective or not, our response is: a person may agree to that, hoping to make a profit, but if the goods turn out to be defective, he will regret it and be upset, and a dispute may arise between him and the vendor. Islam – praise be to Allaah – has blocked the way to regret, disputes and conflict. By the same token, if the goods get destroyed en route, conflicts may arise between the two parties. The point here is that it is not permitted to sell goods until they have have reached the vendor, then he may sell them.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.As the brother has mentioned, smoking is haraam because of the general evidence that indicates that it is haraam. There is no specific text from the Messenger SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because smoking only emerged recently, but the principles of sharee’ah are general in application, and some indications in some reports indicate that it is haraam. If a smoker sits next to you and wants to smoke, then advise him gently and kindly. Tell him, “My brother, this is haraam, and it is not permissible for you.” I think that if you advise him kindly and gently, he will refrain from smoking, as we and others have found out by experience. If he does not refrain from smoking, then you have to leave him, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’aan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them…” [al-Nisa’ 4:140] But this is when it is in a public place.

It makes up for not being able to be with the people of knowledge, although being with them is preferable and makes it easier to understand and discuss matters. But if they cannot do that, then listening to tapes is enough, because this is all they can do. Can they be regarded as students or seekers of knowledge when they are limiting themselves to that? We say, yes they can, if they make a great effort, just as a person can become a scholar if he takes knowledge from books. But the difference between taking knowledge from books and tapes and receiving it directly from the scholars is that it is much better to take it directly from the scholars, because then it is easy to discuss things, unlike when listening to tapes or reading books. It requires a great deal of effort to learn all aspects of knowledge in this way.

Refer to the following, quoted from the famous Mayo Clinic: [Begin quote] Many people believe that because alcohol is sensitive to heat, it is eliminated with cooking. However, not all the alcohol content of alcoholic drinks is removed with heat; it depends on the type and time of cooking. For instance if you add beer or wine to boiling liquid, then immediately remove it from the heat, 85 per cent of the alcohol content will remain. If you light the alcohol, as in flambé dishes, 75 per cent will remain. Even after simmering the dish for one and a half hours, it will still have 20 per cent of the original alcohol content. It is only if you simmer the mixture for two or more hours, (as you would with a wine-based beef casserole), that as little as five to 10 per cent of the original alcohol content remains.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The phrase in the hadeeth about the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without being called to account, that they “do not ask for ruqyah” means that they do not seek it from others. But the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us and taught us to seek treatment, as he said: “Allaah has not created any disease without also creating the cure; some know it and some do not.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 5678). Ruqyah and seeking medical treatment differ in two ways: The first difference is that a person will feel a greater attachment to the one who does ruqyah than to the one who offers medical treatment, because if Allaah decrees that he should be healed through ruqyah, the bond between the person who did the ruqyah and the person who was sick is a spiritual bond, as the cure did not come about through physical means. The fact that it is a spiritual bond may be a source of fitnah (temptation or trial), as he may say, “he is one of the awliya’ (close friends) of Allaah” and so on, which may lead him to shirk (associating partners with Allaah). Hence it was followed by the words “… and who put their trust in their Lord.” The second difference is that a sick person may ask for ruqyah from someone who is not qualified to do it, because the latter is not using something tangible that can be identified. So the person who has been asked to do ruqyah may do it, and the sick person may be healed coincidentally, not as a result of the ruqyah which was not done according to sharee’ah, but at the same time as the ruqyah is done, so people may suffer fitnah because of this, and think that this is a person whose du’aa’s are answered and whose ruqyah is blessed, when this is not the case. For this reason the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “… those who do not ask for ruqyah..” and did not say “those who do not seek treatment. Seeking treatment is essential, but it is better not to seek ruqyah. However, if a person comes forward and recites something over you and you do not stop him, this does not mean that you are not counted among the people mentioned in the hadeeth, because you did not ask for ruqyah. By the same token, if you do ruqyah for your brother, you are doing him a favour, and this does not rule you out from being one of the seventy thousand. Thus we say that the extra phrase reported in Saheeh Muslim, “… and they did not do ruqyah…” is a dubious addition that is not saheeh. The correct wording is only “Those who did not ask for ruqyah.” With regard to seeking ruqyah from a scholar, if he is known as such then you can ask him for ruqyah, because if he treats a person with ruqyah, they will benefit from it, by the grace of Allaah, as is the case with doctors who treat people. With regard to the question of whether we should treat the person who is afflicted by the evil eye with ruqyah or tell him to bear it with patience, the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us the way to seek healing from the evil eye, when he told the one who had put the evil eye on one of his companions to do ghusl and wudoo’, then to take some of the water and pour it over the one who was afflicted until he recovered.\n",

Whatever you have taken at the time when they had enough of their own has to be given back to the original donors, if you know who they are, otherwise you must give it away in charity with the intention of it being zakaah on their behalf, because you took it with the intention of it being zakaah from them. As for the money that you have accumulated from the retirement fund, use it as you see fit, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And come not near to the orphan’s property, except to improve it…” [al-An’aam 6:152]. As for the debt to the real estate development company, you know that it is to be repaid in installments, not all at once, so pay it back in installments. The deceased has nothing to do with it, except with regard to the installments that were due before his death, if he did not pay them. As for the installments that were not due until after his death, they are nothing to do with him because they have to do with this property, the ownership of which has passed to his heirs.

      "Praise be to Allah.The fact that jinn can enter human bodies is proven in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings), and by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah (main body of Muslims who are united upon the sunnah), and by real-life events. No one disputes this apart from the M’utazilah (a deviant sect) who give priority to their own rational analysis over the evidence of the Quran and Sunnah. We will mention a little about this below: Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Those who eat riba (interest) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like Riba’…” [2:275] Al-Qurtubi said in his Tafseer (exegesis): “This ayah (verse) is proof that those people are wrong who deny that epilepsy is caused by the jinn and claim that its causes are only physical, and that the Shaytan does not enter people or cause madness.” Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer, after mentioning the ayah quoted above: “They will not rise from their graves on the Day of Resurrection except like the way in which the epileptic rises during his seizure, when he is beaten by the Shaytan. This is because they will rise in a very bad state. Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the one who consumes riba will rise on the Day of Resurrection crazy and choking.” According to a saheeh hadeeth (authentic report) narrated by al-Nasai from Abu’l-Yusr, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray: “Allahumma innee a’oodhu bika min al-taraddi wa’l-haram wa’l-gharaq wa’l-harq, wa a’oodhu bika an yatakhabatani al-shaytan ‘ind al-mawt (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from being thrown from a high place, old age, drowning and burning; and I seek refuge with You from being beaten by the Shaytan at the time of death).” Commenting on this hadeeth in Al-Fayd, al-Manawi said: “[The phrase] ‘and I seek refuge with You from being beaten by the Shaytan at the time of death’ means, lest he should wrestle with me and play with me, and damage my religious commitment or mental state (at the time of death) by means of his insinuating whispers which cause people to slip or lose their minds. The Shaytan could take control of a person when he is about to depart this world, and misguide him or stop him from repenting…” Ibn Taymiyah said: “The fact that jinn can enter human bodies is proven by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Those who eat riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like riba’…’ [2:275]. And in as-Saheeh it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘The Shaytan flows through the son of Adam as the blood flows through his veins.’” ‘Abd-Allah ibn al-Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: “I said to my father, ‘There are some people who say that the jinn do not enter the body of the epileptic.’ He said: ‘O my son, they are lying; the jinn could speak through this person.’” Commenting on this, Ibn Qudamah said: “What he said is well known, because a person may suffer an epileptic seizure and speak in a language that no one understands, and his body may be beaten with blows that would fell a camel, but the epileptic does not feel them at all, and he is also unaware of the words he is saying. The epileptic and others may be dragged about, or the carpet on which he is sitting may be pulled, and utensils may be moved about from place to place, and other things may happen. Anyone who witnesses such a thing will know for sure that the one who is speaking through the person and moving these things is not human.” And he said, may Allah have mercy on him: “There is no one among the imams (religious leaders/scholars) of the Muslims who denies that jinn may enter the body of the epileptic and others. Anyone who denies this and claims that Islam denies it is lying about Islam. There is nothing in the proofs of sharee’ah (Islamic law) to show that it does not happen.” So the fact that jinn may enter human bodies is proven in the Quran and Sunnah, and by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah, some of whose comments we have quoted above. As regards the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah’s Leave” [2:102], this is undoubtedly a clear indication that the jinn cannot harm anyone through witchcraft or epilepsy or through any other kind of disturbance or misguidance, except with the permission of Allah. As al-Hasan al-Basri said: “Whomever Allah wills, He gives them power over him, and whomever He does not will, He does not give them power over him, and they cannot do anything to anyone except with the permission of Allah.” The Shaytan (who is the disbelieving jinn) may gain power over the believers by making them sin and by making them neglect the remembrance and Tawheed of Allah (maintaining Allah’s Oneness) and sincerity in worshipping Him. But he has no power over the righteous slaves of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism) — you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.” [17:65] During the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) the Arabs were well aware of this and mentioned it in their poetry. For example, the poet al-A’asha likened his she-camel’s energy to that of one who was touched by the jinn, and said that it was the jinn who was giving her energy. As regards the causes of epilepsy, Ibn Taymiyah explained the causes. He said: “When the jinn touch a person with epilepsy, it may be because of desire or love, just as happens between one human and another… or it may – as is usually the case – be because of hatred and punishment, such as when a person has harmed them or they think that he has harmed them deliberately, either by urinating on them or pouring hot water on them or killing them, even if the person did that unknowingly. There are ignorant and wrongdoing ones among the jinn who may punish a person more than he deserves, or they may be playing with him and mistreating him, like foolish people among mankind.” And I say: the way to save oneself from this is to remember Allah and speak His Name at the beginning of all things, as it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to mention Allah in many cases, such as when eating, drinking, mounting his riding-beast, taking off his clothes for any reason, having intercourse and so on… As regards treatment (of one whose body has been entered by the jinn), Ibn Taymiyah said (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 19/42): “When the jinn attack a person, they should be told of the rulings of Allah and His Messenger, proof should be established against them, and they should be commanded to do what is good and told not to do what is evil, just as should be done in the case of people, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)’ [al-Israa’ 17:15].” Then he said: “If the jinn does not leave after being addressed in this manner, then it is permissible to rebuke him, tell him off, threaten him and curse him, as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did with the Shaytaan when he came with a falling star to throw it in his face, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I seek refuge with Allah from you and I curse you with the curse of Allah” – three times. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). We may also seek help against the jinn by remembering Allah (dhikr) and reciting Qur’an, especially Aayat al-Kursiy. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites it will remain under the protection of Allah and no Shaytaan (devil) will be able to approach him until the morning.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). And al-Mi’wadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Qur’an) may also be recited. As for psychiatrists who do not treat the epileptic in the manner described, they cannot do him any good at all. This issue may be discussed in much more detail, but what we have said here is sufficient for those who want to know a little about this matter, Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Lord of the Worlds. Firstly: Letters of credit may be of different types, initial or final. Either type of letter of credit may or may not be covered by the balance in the businessman’s account. If it is not covered, then the the issuer bears joint liability with the applicant with regard to current and future obligations. This is essentially what is known in Islamic fiqh as damaan (liability) or kafaalah (sponsorship or surety). If the letter of credit is covered, then the relationship between the one who is requesting it and the provider (the bank) is that of an agency. Acting as an agent is valid whether or not a fee is paid, so long as the agent relationship serves the interest of the one for whom it is done (in this case the third party from whom the good are being purchased). Kafaalah (sponsorship) is a voluntary agreement whose purpose is goodwill. The fuqaha’ have stated that it is not permissible to accept a fee in return for it, because in that case when the sponsor (kafeel) receives a sum of money when the credit is paid, it becomes like a loan which brought some benefit to the lender, which is not allowed in Islam [because it is like riba or interest – Translator]. On this basis, the following is clear: Firstly: that it is not permissible to charge a fee for issuing a letter of credit – which usually takes into account the amount of money and length of time involved – whether the credit is covered or not. Secondly: charging administration fees for preparing either type of letter of credit is permissible, so long as the amount charged does not exceed what is usual, whether the letter of credit is wholly or partly covered. In evaluating the administration fee for issuing a letter of credit, it should be taken into account what is actually involved in doing so. And Allaah knows best.\n",

Where the tenant and landlord come to an agreement during the period of the tenancy or after it has ended. Where there is an agreement between the tenant and a new tenant, during the period of the tenancy or after it has ended. Where there is an agreement between the new tenant and both the landlord and the first tenant, before the first tenancy expires or afterwards. Secondly, if the landlord and tenant agree that the tenant will pay a certain amount of money in addition to the regular rent – which in some countries is called a deposit – there is nothing Islamically wrong with paying this amount, provided that it is counted as part of the rent for the agreed period; when the contract comes to an end, this amount is subject to the rulings on rents. When the rental period comes to an end, and is not renewed explicitly or implicitly – in cases where automatic renewal is provided for in a clause of the lease – it is not permitted to pay this money, because the landlord has more right to the property once the tenant no longer has any right to it. Fourthly, if an agreement is reached between the first tenant and the new tenant during the period of the tenancy agreement that the former will give up the remainder of his lease in return for a sum of money over and above the regular rent, this transaction is permissible, provided that attention is paid to the terms of the contract drawn up between the landlord and the first tenant, because many rental agreements expressly state that tenants are not allowed to sublet properties to other parties or to accept “key-money” except with the agreement of the landlord. If this is the case, it must be adhered to. If the agreement between the first tenant and the new tenant is reached after the expiry of the lease, it is haraam to pay key-money, because the first tenant no longer has any rights with regard to the property.

It is also permissible to name one price for cash sales, and another for payment by installments made within certain periods. The sale is not valid unless both parties are certain about either cash or installments. If there is some indecision with regard to cash or installments, and the two parties fail to reach an agreement on one specific price, then the sale is not permissible according to sharee’ah. According to sharee’ah, it is not permissible in the case of payment by installments, to state interest rates as a separate item based on the length of time taken to repay, regardless of whether the two parties agree on the rate of interest or it is based on the current rate. If the purchaser is late in paying the installments, it is not permissible to make him pay extra, whether or not this is arranged as a prior condition, because this is a form of forbidden ribaa. It is forbidden for a debtor who can afford the installments to delay payment when they are due. At the same time, according to sharee’ah it is not permissible to set a condition that he should pay compensation in the event of late payments. According to sharee’ah, it is permissible to set a condition that the debtor has to bring forward the payment, if he delays some of the payments, so long as the debtor agrees to this condition at the time when the contract is drawn up. The vendor does not have the right to keep the purchaser’s property after the item has been sold, but it is permissible for the vendor to stipulate some security as a guarantee that the purchaser will pay the installments. (Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami, p. 109) It is permissible according to sharee’ah to reduce the amount owing in order to expedite the settlement of the matter, whether this is done by request of the vendor or the purchaser. This is not counted as forbidden ribaa so long as it is not based on a prior agreement and so long as this agreement between the two parties is reached on a one-on-one basis, without the involvement of any third party, because in that case the rulings on the settlement of business accounts would apply. It is permissible for the two parties to agree that all installments should be paid immediately if the debtor fails to make one payment, unless he is in difficulty and has no means of paying. If the debt becomes due because the debtor dies, becomes bankrupt or delays payment, then in any of these circumstances it is permissible to reduce the debt so that the matter may be settled quickly to the mutual satisfaction of both parties. The definition of hardship which means that the vendor should wait for payment is: that the debtor should not have more wealth or property than he needs to meet his basic requirements and pay his debt.

      "Praise be to Allah.According to shareeah, a transaction is made when there is an offer [of goods or services] and this is accepted, within the framework of shar'i conditions and in the absence of anything that might invalidate the transaction. An example of this in the case of a sale might be when the vendor says I sell this to you and the purchaser says I agree. There have been major developments in the field of communications which are now widely used to speed up financial dealings and transactions, which we must bear in mind whilst also taking into account what the fuqahaa have said about carrying out transactions via letter, in writing, by means of gestures or through intermediaries. They also established that transactions should be carried out between two parties who are present in the same place with the exception of wills, the appointment of executors and the giving of power of attorney; the offer and agreement should both refer to the same thing and price, there should be no expression or indication that either party is turning away from the deal, and the agreement to an offer should not be delayed beyond whatever timespan is customarily regarded as acceptable. In the light of the above, the fuqahaa have established the following: If the transaction is carried out between two parties who are not present in the same place where one can actually see the other or hear his voice, and the only means of communication between them is by writing, mail, sending a messenger, this applies also to telegraphs, telexes, faxes and computer screens, in these cases the transaction is complete when the offer reaches the prospective purchaser and he agrees to it. If the transaction is drawn up at the same time, between two parties who are in different locations which applies to telephones and wireless communications the contract between them is considered to be a contract drawn up between two parties who are present in the same place, and in this case the basic rulings as stated by the fuqahaa and referred to in al-Deebaajah apply. If the vendor makes a limited-time offer through these means of communication, he is bound by it for the duration and he cannot go back on it. The rules outlined above do not include nikaah (marriage contracts) because of the requirement of two witnesses in nikaah, or barter because there has to be an actual exchange of goods or services, or forward buying, because this requires a cash down-payment. In cases where there is the possibility of forgery, fraud or error, reference should be made to the general rules concerning the establishment of proof.l And Allaah knows best.\n",

The menstruating woman herself is not naajis, neither is her sweat. The Jews used to think this, but Allaah stated that this was a lie, as is reported in the saheeh hadeeth narrated by Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on him) from Anas: \"When one of their women menstruated, the Jews would not eat with her or sit with her in their houses. The Companions of the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) asked the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) about this, and Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): ‘They ask you about menstruation. Say: That is an adhaa (a harmful thing for a husband to have intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they have purified (from menses and taken a bath)…’ [al-Baqarah 2:222]. The Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: ‘Do everything except have intercourse.’ Word of this reached the Jews and they said: ‘What does this man mean, in every issue he differs from us!’\" (Saheeh Muslim, 455).

If she dislikes his physical appearance because of some deformity or ugliness, or because one of his faculties is missing, she has the right of khula’.

If he deprives of her of her rights of spending on her maintenance, clothing and other essential needs, when he is able to provide these things, then she has the right to ask for khula’. If he does not give her her conjugal rights and thus keep her chaste because he is impotent (i.e. unable to have intercourse), or because he does not like her, or he prefers someone else, or he is unfair in the division of his time [i.e., among co-wives], then she has the right to ask for khula’.

      "Praise be to Allah. The phrase al-mala al-a’ala is mentioned in both the Quran and the sunnah (prophetic teachings). In Surah Saad, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and discussing (about the creation of Adam). Only this has been inspired to me, that I am a plain warner.’\" [38:69-70] In his commentary on this ayah (verse), Shaykh al-Mufassireen Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: \"‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high (al-mala al-a’ala) when they were disputing and discussing’: here Allah is telling His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) , ‘O Muhammad, say to the mushrikeen (polytheists) among your people: \"I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and discussing\" about the creation of Adam before Allah revealed this to me.’ What this means is: ‘My telling you about this is clear proof that this Quran is a Revelation from Allah, because you know that I had no knowledge of this before this Quran was revealed; it is not something I witnessed with my own two eyes – I know it only because Allah has informed me of it.’\" Other scholars of tafseer (exegesis) have said something similar to this. The comments of other scholars: Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said: \"Allah’s words (interpretation of the meaning) ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, when they were consulted about the creation of Adam, and they disputed it and said: Do not place a khaleefah (vicegerent) on earth.\" Al-Sa’adi said: \"‘… The chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing’ means: ‘… when your Lord said to the angels: \"Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth\"…’ [2:30] Qutadah said: \"The words ‘I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing’ refer to the angels, who disputed the creation of Adam when Allah said to them, (interpretation of the meaning) ‘Truly, I am going to create man from clay’.” [38:71]. As regards what was reported in the sunnah, Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah spoke to him in a dream and said, \"O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high are disputing about?… about the things which expiate for sins. Things that expiate for sins are: staying in the mosque after the prayers, walking to join congregational prayers and performing wudu properly when it is difficult to do so. Whoever does these things will have a good life and die a good death, and he will be as free from sin as on the day his mother bore him.\" [Al-Tirmidhi]) In his commentary on this hadeeth (narration), al-Mubarakpuri explained that \"the chiefs on high\" (al-mala al-a’ala) referred to the angels who are closest to Allah. Al-mala refers to nobles who attend gatherings and sit at their head because of their high status. They are described as al-a’ala either because they live on high, or because of their high status in the sight of Allah. Their \"dispute\" refers either to their competing or rushing to record these deeds and take them up to heaven, or to their discussing the virtue and blessing of these deeds, or to their feeling happy about people when they do these good deeds. It may have been called a \"dispute\" because it came in the form of questions and answers, which sounds like a dispute or a debate, hence it was appropriate to use the word \"dispute\" in this context.

      "Praise be to Allah.Many saheeh ahaadeeth have been narrated which explain to the Muslims who is most qualified and has the most right to lead the prayers. One of these ahaadeeth is that which was narrated from Abu Saeed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If there are three people, let one of them lead the others in prayer, and the one who has the most right to lead them is the one who knows more Quraan. (Narrated by Muslim, no. 1077). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The people should be led in prayer by the one who has most knowledge of the Quraan and has been reciting it for longer. If they are equal in their knowledge and reading of the Quraan, then they should be led by the one who made hijrah first. If they are equal with regard to hijrah, then they should be led by the one who is older (Narrated by Muslim, 1079). To sum up what is indicated by these ahaadeeth, the one who has the most right to lead the others in prayer is: the one who has most knowledge of the Book of Allaah and of the fiqh of salaah. Those who knew more of the Book of Allaah were appointed to lead the prayers at the time of the Sahaabah, because they had learned the correct way of reciting the aayat and they had learned the knowledge contained therein and the deeds prescribed by the Quraan. So they combined knowledge and action [they acted upon what they had learned], and did not stop at merely memorizing as is the case nowadays. How many people learn all or part of the Quraan, take care to recite it properly and with a beautiful voice, but they do not know anything about the fiqh of salaah. If they are equal with regard to knowledge of the Quraan, then the one who knows more about the Sunnah should lead the prayer. If they are equal with regard to knowledge of the Sunnah, then the one who made hijrah first should lead the prayer. If they are equal with regard to hijrah, or if this does not apply, then the one who is older should lead the prayer, as is indicated in the hadeeth of Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith, who said: We came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and we were young people, close in age. We stayed with him for twenty days, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was kind to us. When he thought that we were missing our families, he asked us about those whom we had left behind, and we told him. He said, Go back to your families and stay with them. Teach them and instruct them and he said some things I remembered and some that I forgot. And pray as you have seen me praying. When the time for prayer comes, let one of you call the Adhaan and let the oldest among you lead the prayer. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 6705). If they are equal with regard to recitation of the Quraan, knowledge and hijrah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded that the eldest of them should be appointed to lead the prayer. If they are equal in age, then the one who is most righteous (has most taqwaa) should be appointed, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has al-Taqwaa (is one of the pious) [al-Hujuraat 49:13]. If they are equal in all regards, then they should draw lots, if there is a dispute. Having a PhD or having lived the longest in the land of the kuffaar does not qualify a person to lead the prayers. The one who has memorized more Quraan and has more knowledge of the fiqh of salaah is the one who should be appointed. It is not right for Muslims to dispute over the leadership of the prayers on the basis of their personal whims and desires. They should appoint the person who is described by shareeah as being qualified to lead the prayers. We ask Allaah to reform the Muslims.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There are a number of ahaadeeth etc. about the Black Stone which we will quote for our brother so that he may learn from them. 1. The Black Stone was sent down by Allaah to this earth from Paradise. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Black Stone came down from Paradise.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 877; al-Nasaa’i, 2935. The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi). 2. The Stone was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the Black Stone came down from Paradise, it was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 877; Ahmad, 2792. Classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, 4/219. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar classed it as qawiy (strong) in Fath al-Baari, 3/462). (a) Al-Mubaarakfoori said in al-Marqaah: This means, the sins of the sons of Adam who touched the stone, caused it to turn black. The hadeeth should be taken at face value, because there is no reason not to, either narrated in a report or by virtue of common sense. (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 3/525) (b) Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: Some heretics tried to criticize this hadeeth by saying: How come the sins of the mushrikeen turned it black and the worship of the people of Tawheed did not make it white? I answer by quoting what Ibn Qutaybah said: If Allaah had willed, that would have happened. But Allaah has caused it to be the case that black usually changes other colours and its not itself changed, which is the opposite to what happens with white. (c) Al-Muhibb al-Tabari said: The fact that it is black is a lesson for those who have insight. If sins can have this effect on an inanimate rock, then the effect they have on the heart is greater. See Fath al-Baari, 3/463 3. The Black Stone will come forth on the Day of Resurrection and will testify in favour of those who touched it in truth. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning the Stone: “By Allaah, Allaah will bring it forth on the Day of Resurrection, and it will have two eyes with which it will see and a tongue with which it will speak, and it will testify in favour of those who touched it in sincerity.” Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 961; Ibn Maajah, 2944 This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, and as qawiy by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari, 3/462 (4) Touching, kissing or pointing to the Black Stone – this is the first thing to be done when starting Tawaaf, whether it is for Hajj or ‘Umrah, or voluntary Tawaaf. It was narrated from Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that when the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Makkaah, he came to the Black Stone and touched it, then he walked to the right of it and ran three times and walked four times [around the Ka’bah]. (narrated by Muslim, 1218). (5) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed the Black Stone, and his ummah followed his lead in doing so. It was narrated that ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) came to the Black Stone and kissed it, then he said: “I know that you are only a stone which can neither bring benefit nor cause harm. Were it not that I had seen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kiss you, I would not have kissed you.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1520; Muslim, 1720) (6) If a person is unable to kiss the Stone, he should touch it with his hand or something else, then he can kiss the thing with which he touched it. (a) It was narrated that Naafi’ said: I saw Ibn ‘Umar touch the Stone with his hand then he kissed his hand. I said, I have never ceased to do this since I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) do it. (Narrated by Muslim, 1268) (b) It was narrated that Abu Tufayl (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) performing Tawaaf around the House, touching the corner [where the Stone is] with a crooked staff which he had with him, then kissing the staff. (Narrated by Muslim, 1275). (7) If a person is unable to do the above, then he can point to it with his hand and say “Allaahu akbar”. It was narrated that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) performed Tawaaf on his camel, and every time he came to the corner [where the Stone is] he would point to it and say “Allaahu akbar.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4987). (8) Touching the Stone is one of the things by means of which Allaah expiates for sins It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “Touching them both [the Black Stone and al-Rukn al-Yamani] is an expiation for sins.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 959. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and as saheeh by al-Haakim (1/664). Al-Dhahabi agreed with him). It is not permissible for a Muslim to annoy other Muslims at the Stone by hitting or fighting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that the Stone will testify in favour of those who touched it in sincerity, which is not the case when a person touches it by disturbing the slaves of Allaah. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The scholars of Islam are agreed that it is permissible to eat the meat of an animal slaughtered by a woman, because of the general terms used in the wording of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Among the evidence that it is permissible are the following: The aayah in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Forbidden for you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals – cattle-beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and the meat of that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah, or has been slaughtered for idols, etc., or on which Allaah’s Name has mot been mentioned while slaughtering, and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns – and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal – unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death)…” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]. The evidence in this aayah is the phrase where Allaah has permitted us to eat of any animal that we are able to slaughter before it dies; this is general in application, and does not specify as to whether the person who manages to do this is a man or a woman – so it could be either. Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh from ‘Ubayd-Allaah from Naafi’, that he (Naafi’) heard Ibn Ka’b ibn Maalik narrating from his father that they used to have sheep which they allowed to graze on the mountain of Sala’ in Madeenah: one of the slave-women noticed that one of the sheep was dying, so she broke a stone and slaughtered it. He said: “Do not eat it until I ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or I send someone to ask him. So he asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or sent someone else to ask, and he told him to eat it. ‘Ubay-Allaah said: “I liked the fact that she was a slave-woman and she managed to slaughter it.” Commenting on this hadeeth, Ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “This shows that it is permitted to eat meat slaughtered by a woman, whether she is free or a slave, old or young, Muslim or of the People of the Book (i.e., Jewish or Christian), in a state of purity or otherwise, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told them to eat the meat she had slaughtered and did not ask for further details.” This hadeeth also answers the question about whether any of the Sahaabiyaat (female Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) slaughtered animals. The discussion above also makes it clear that a woman may slaughter animals, because of the general terms used in the texts, and there is no difference in this regard between meat slaughtered as a sacrifice or meat slaughtered for regular food. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “It is permitted to eat from an animal which a man or a woman slaughters Islamically before it dies, or from meat slaughtered by a woman, even if she is menstruating, because her menstruation is not in her hand. It is permissible to eat meat from an animal which a woman slaughters Islamically before it dies, by the consensus of the Muslims.” (Al-Fataawa, 35/234).\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.Evidence in the Qur’aan and Sunnah points to the fact that Allaah is above the heavens, mustawin over His Throne in a manner that befits His Majesty and Greatness. Allaah says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): \"The Most Beneficent istawaa (rose over) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His majesty).\" [Ta-Ha 20:5] (For more information, please see question #992 ). As for meeting Allaah and seeing Him: meeting Him occurs after death and on the Day of Judgement; seeing Him will occur only on the Day of Judgement. Concerning the meeting with Allaah after death, Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh, in the chapter on \"whoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah loves to meet him\": From ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit, from the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) who said: \"Whoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah will love to meet him, and whoever hates to meet Allaah, Allaah will hate to meet him.\" ‘Aa’ishah or one of his wives said: \"But we all dislike the idea of death.\" He said, \"It is not what you are thinking. When death approaches the believer and he is given the news of Allaah’s pleasure and honour, nothing will be more dear to him than what lies ahead of him, so he will love to meet Allaah and Allaah will love to meet him. But when death approaches the disbeliever and he is given the news of Allaah’s wrath and punishment, nothing will be more disliked by him that what lies ahead of him, so he will hate to meet Allaah and Allaah will hate to meet him.\" (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 6026). The words \"nothing will be more dear to him than what lies ahead of him\" refer to what he will go through after death. Muslim and al-Nisaa’i report that Shurayh ibn Haani’ said: \"I said to ‘Aa’ishah: ‘I have heard a hadeeth which, if it is as I heard it, means that we are doomed. The hadeeth says: \"There is not one of us who does not dislike death.\"’ She said: ‘It is not what you think. What it means is when a person’s eyes stare without blinking, when the death rattle is in his chest and his skin and muscles contract.’ This is the state of one who is dying. \"Al-Khattaabi said: \"There are different types of meeting: it may mean seeing with one’s own eyes, or it may mean resurrection, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):‘They indeed are losers who denied their meeting with Allaah…’ [al-An’aam 6:31]; or it may mean death, as Allaah says: (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Whoever hopes for the Meeting with Allaah, then Allaah’s term is surely coming…’ [al-‘Ankaboot 29:5] and ‘Say (to them): Verily, the death from which you flee will surely meet you…’ [al-Jumu’ah 62:8]\" The meeting with Allaah (mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above) refers to something other than death, because in another hadeeth the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said, \"Death is a barrier between us and the meeting with Allaah.\" But when death is the means of meeting Allaah, it is described as the meeting with Allaah. Imaam Abu ‘Ubayd al-Qaasim ibn Salaam said: \"The hadeeth does not refer to a dislike of death and the suffering involved, because everybody feels this way. What is being criticized here is a love and preference for this world and a dislike of the idea of moving on to Allaah and the Hereafter. This is explained by the fact that Allaah condemned people who love this life, and said (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… those who hope not for their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present world…’ [Yoonus 10:7].\" Al-Nawawi said: \"The meaning of the hadeeth is that the like and dislike referred to are those that occur at the time of death, at the stage when repentance is no longer acceptable, when the dying person is shown where he is headed. There is also some discussion in the hadeeth about the dislike of death. Whoever dislikes death because he prefers this life to the blessings of the Hereafter is condemned. Whoever dislikes death because he fears being brought to account for his shortcomings, lack of preparation and failure to carry out the commands of Allah properly, is not to blame in this case. The one who feels this way should hasten to prepare himself so that when death comes to him he will not dislike it but will love it because of the meeting with Allaah which he is hoping for after death. The hadeeth quoted above also indicates that no living person will see Allaah in this life, but that the believers will see Him after death, as the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: \"Death is a barrier between us and the meeting with Allaah.\" This fact is stated even more clearly in another hadeeth narrated by Muslim from Abu Umaamah, in which the Prophet (Peace & Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) says: \"Know that you will not see your Lord until you die.\" The meeting with Allaah and seeing Him on the Day of Judgement is proven in many texts, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \"Some faces that Day will be naadirah (shining and radiant), looking at their Lord.\" [al-Qiyaamah 75:22-23] Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the people said, \"O Messenger of Allaah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?\" He said, \"Do you have any doubts about seeing the full moon on a cloudless night?\" They said, \"No.\" He said, \"Do you have any doubts about seeing the sun on a cloudless day?\" They said, \"No.\" He said, \"Then you will see your Lord in the same way.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 764). We ask Allaah to let us meet Him when He is pleased with us. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Your husband is preventing you from embracing Islam, and does not want to become Muslim himself. He prefers divorce to Islam, although you have tried to persuade him of the truth to no avail. This means that this man is no good. Moreover, you say that he is bad-tempered and violent, that any improvement is only temporary, and that you do not love him at all. If this man is as you say, he is no good from either a religious or a worldly point of view, and there is no use in staying with him. Our advice to you in this case is to leave him immediately, and try hard to gain custody of your two daughters so that they may grow up in Islam. According to Islamic shareeah, in such cases custody should be awarded to the Muslim parent, because Islam should prevail, not be prevailed over. As regards the second part of your question, and this man whom you say is a Muslim, you must make sure that he is a chaste man, not one who is immoral or corrupt. Do not establish any relationship with him before marriage. If you find out for sure that he is chaste and solidly religious, I advise you to marry him as soon as your iddah (waiting period after divorce) is over. I ask Allaah to take care of you by His mercy, to make the right thing easy for you, to help you enter this religion and to save you from kufr and its followers. Remember the story of Pharaohs wife, who was Muslim although her husband was a kaafir. Allaah said about her (interpretation of the meaning): \"And Allaah sets forth an example for those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh, when she said: My Lord! Build for me a home with You in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his work, and save me from the people who are zaalimoon (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in Allaah).\" [al-Tahreem 66:11] May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Contents Related Islam: Easy to follow Is seafood halal? Forbidden water animals Praise be to Allah.Islam: Easy to follow Among the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us is the fact that He has made our religion easy for us, and has not made it too difficult or unbearable. He has allowed us many things that were forbidden according to previously-revealed laws. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you…” [al-Baqarah 2:185] Is seafood halal? Hence all kinds of food from the sea are permissible, whether they are plants or animals, alive or dead. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food – for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel…” [al-Maidah 5:96]. Ibn 'Abbas said: “ Sayduhu (lit. hunting, pursuit) refers to whatever is taken from it alive, and ta’amuhu (lit. its food) means whatever is taken dead.” Forbidden water animals There are a few things – certain types of water animals – which some scholars exclude from the permission outlined above. These are: 1- Crocodiles: The correct view is that eating these is not allowed, because they have fangs and live on land – even though they may spend a lot of time in the water – so precedence should be given to the reason for forbidding it (it is a land animal that has fangs). 2- Frogs: It is not permitted to eat them because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade killing them, as is reported in the hadith of ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Uthman, who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the killing of frogs. (Narrated by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Majah; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 6970). The rule is that everything which we are forbidden to kill, we are not allowed to eat; if we are allowed to eat it we are allowed to kill it. Some scholars exclude sea snakes, but the correct view is that as they live nowhere except in the water, we are permitted to eat them, because of the general nature of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food – for the benefit of yourselves …” [al-Maidah 5:96] 3- Otters and turtles: The correct view is that to be on the safe side, it is permissible to eat them after slaughtering them properly, because they live both on land and in the sea. Here the rule is that in the case of animals that live both on land and in the sea, the rules concerning land animals should be given precedence, to be on the safe side, so they must be slaughtered properly, except for crabs which do not need to be slaughtered, even though they live both on land and in the sea, because they do not have blood. Everything that can cause harm is forbidden as food, even if it comes from the sea, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you.” [al-Nisa 4:29] and: “… and do not throw yourselves into destruction…” [al-Baqarah 2:195] (See al-Mughni, 11/83; Hashiyah al-Rawd, 7/430; Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 3/197; and Ahkam al-At’imah by al-Fawzan).

      "Praise be to Allah. A number of trees are mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, some of which will be discussed below: The date palm tree This is a good tree to which Allaah likened the word of Tawheed when it is established in the sincere heart, where it bears fruits of good deeds that strengthen eemaan (faith). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"See you not how Allaah sets forth a parable? – A goodly word is as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the sky (i.e., very high).\" [Ibraaheem 14:24] This is the tree to which Allaah likens the believer because it is good in all aspects, it is lasting and it offers different kinds of benefit. Ibn ‘Umar reported: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘There is a kind of tree whose leaves do not fall and it is like the Muslim. Tell me what it is.’ The people mentioned different kinds of desert trees … and I said to myself, ‘It is the date palm tree,’ but I felt too shy to speak up. Then the people said, ‘Tell us what it is, O Messenger of Allaah.’ He said: ‘It is the date palm tree.’\" (al-Bukhaari, 60) The blessed olive tree the purity of which Allaah set forth as a parable Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Allaah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp is in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east (i.e., it neither gets sun-rays only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e., nor does it get sun-rays only in the afternoon – but it is exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allaah guides to His Light whom He wills. And Allaah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allaah is All-Knower of everything.\" [al-Noor 24:35] In Soorat al-Mu’minoon, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And a tree (olive) that springs forth from Mount Sinai, that grows oil, and (it is a) relish for the eaters.\" [al-Mu’minoon 23:20] Abu Aseed said: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Eat the oil and use it on your hair and skin, for it comes from a blessed tree.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1775; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’) The tree which Allaah caused to grow for Yoonus (upon whom be peace) for food and healing. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And, verily, Yoonus was one of the Messengers … Then a (big) fish swallowed him and he had done an act worthy of blame. Had he not been of those who glorify Allaah, he would have indeed remained inside its belly until the Day of Resurrection. But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick, and We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.\" [al-Saaffaat 37:139, 142-146] The mufassireen (commentators) said: The gourd (al-yaqteen) is a kind of pumpkin. Some of them described the benefits of the pumpkin, such as: it grows quickly, it provides shade, it has large, smooth leaves, it keeps flies away and its fruit provides good nourishment: it can be eaten raw or cooked, and its skin may be eaten too. It is known that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) liked this kind of pumpkin and used to look for it on the plate of food. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). The great tree in heaven where our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw his father Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace) Samurah ibn Jundub reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, describing his vision: \"Then we went up until we reached a green garden, in which there was a great tree, with an old man and children at its base, and another man near the tree, trying to light a fire in front of him. They took me up to that tree and into a house; I have never seen any more beautiful than that house. In it there were men, old men, youths, women and children. Then they brought me out and took me up to the tree and into another house, even better than the first one. In this house there were old and young men. I said: ‘You have shown me around tonight; tell me about what I have seen.’ They said, ‘Yes… the old man at the foot of the tree was Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace), and the children around him were the children of mankind…\" (al-Bukhaari, 1270). Sidrat al-Muntaha, by which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw Jibreel when he was taken up into the heavens Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And indeed he (Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him (Jibreel) at a second descent (i.e., another time), near Sidrat al-Muntaha (the lote tree of the utmost boundary, beyond which none can pass), near it is the Paradise of Abode, when that covered the lote-tree which did cover it! The sight (of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) turned not aside (right or left), nor did it transgress beyond (the) limit (ordained for it). Indeed, he did see of the Greatest Signs of his Lord (Allaah).\" [al-Najm 53:13-18] The phrase translated here as \"when that covered the lote-tree which did cover it\" is explained by the hadeeth narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari from Abu Dharr, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"It was covered in colours, I do not know what they are…\" According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu Sa’eed and Ibn ‘Abbaas, he said: \"It was covered by the angels.\" According to a report narrated by Muslim, he said: \"When it was covered with whatever covered it by the command of Allaah, it changed, and none of the creation of Allaah could describe its beauty.\" In the famous hadeeth about his Mi’raaj (ascent into heaven), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that when Jibreel took him up into the heavens, he went through from one heaven to the next by the command of Allaah, until he reached the seventh heaven. He said: \"Then I was taken to Sidrat al-Muntaha; its fruits were like the pitchers of Hajar and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. He said, ‘This is Sidrat al-Muntaha’…\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3598). The reason why it is called Sidrat al-Muntaha is stated in the hadeeth narrated from Ibn Mas’ood by Imaam Muslim: \"There everything that comes up from earth stops (yantahee), and it is taken from there, and there everything that comes down stops, and it is taken from there.\" Al-Nawawi said: It is called Sidrat al-Muntaha because the knowledge of the angels stops at that point, and no one has gone beyond it except the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is the tree at which the knowledge of every Prophet who has been sent and every angel who is near to Allaah stops. What lies beyond it is unseen; no one knows it except Allaah or the one to whom He tells it. It was said that this is the ultimate destination of the souls of the martyrs. The fruits described in the hadeeth are well known: they are the fruits of the lotus tree. Al-Khattaabi said that the phrase \"like the pitchers of Hajar\" meant that they were big like pitchers; this is something that was known to the first listeners, which is why this analogy was used. Hajar is a place-name. The phrase \"its leaves were like the ears of elephants\" is also indicative of huge size. The Tree of Tooba in Paradise Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"In Paradise there is a tree in whose shade a rider could travel for a hundred years without crossing it. Recite, if you wish: ‘In shade long-extended’ [al-Waaqi’ah 56:30]\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4502) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Tooba is a tree in Paradise, one hundred years big. The clothes of the people of Paradise are made from its calyces (outer casing of its flowers).\" (Reported by Ibn Hibbaan; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3918) ‘Utbah ibn ‘Abdin al-Salami said: \"A Bedouin came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him about al-Hawd (the cistern). He mentioned Paradise, then the Bedouin asked him, ‘Is there fruit there?’ He said, ‘Yes, and there is a tree called Tooba.’ The Bedouin asked, ‘What tree of this world does it resemble?’ He said, ‘It does not resemble any tree of your land. Have you been to Syria?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘It resembles a tree in Syria called al-Jawzah (walnut) which grows on one trunk then spreads its branches higher up.’ The Bedouin asked, ‘How big is its trunk?’ He said, ‘If one of the camels of your people was to go around it, it would not complete one circuit before its neck broke of old age and exhaustion. The Bedouin asked, ‘Are there grapes there?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He asked, ‘How big is a bunch?’ He said, ‘The distance a crow could fly without stopping in a month.’ He asked, ‘How big is one grape?’ He said, ‘Does your father ever slaughter a he-goat from his flocks?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘And does he skin it and give the hide to your mother, and say, \"Make me a bucket\"?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ The Bedouin asked, ‘Is one grape big enough to satisfy me and my family?’ He said, ‘Yes, and your whole tribe.’\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad). The tree of Zaqqoom, which is the food of the people of Hell This tree is described in the Qur’aan as (interpretation of the meaning): \"… the accursed tree (mentioned) in the Qur’aan\" [al-Israa’ 17:60]. Allaah also says about it (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then, moreover, verily, - you the erring-ones, the deniers (of Resurrection)! You verily will eat of the trees of Zaqqoom. Then you will fill your bellies therewith, and drink boiling water on top of it, so you will drink (that) like thirsty camels! That will be their entertainment on the Day of Recompense!\" [al-Waaqi’ah 56:51-56] \"Verily, the tree of Zaqqoom, will be the food of the sinners, like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said): ‘Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water, taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be the mighty, the generous! Verily! This is that whereof you used to doubt!’\" [al-Dukhaan 44:43-50] \"Is that (Paradise) better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqoom (a horrible tree in Hell)? Truly We have made it (as) a trial for the Zaalimoon (polytheists, disbelievers, wrongdoers, etc.). Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire, the shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of shayaateen (devils); truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on the top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture (of boiling water and Zaqqoom in their bellies). Then, thereafter, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.\" [al-Saafaat 37:62-68] The tree under which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted his Companions’ pledge of allegiance unto death and not to desert him. This happened during the campaign of al-Hudaybiyah, when he heard of the betrayal of the mushrikeen. This tree is also mentioned in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): \"Indeed, Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave the Bay’ah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad) under the tree…\" [al-Fath 48:18] The tree next to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to preach Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullaah (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go and stand next to a tree or palm-tree on Fridays. A woman or a man of the Ansaar said: \"O Messenger of Allaah, should we not make for you a minbar (\"pulpit\")?\" He said, \"If you wish.\" So they made a minbar for him, and when the next Friday came, he was shown to the minbar. The tree cried like a small child, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came down and hugged the crying tree until it calmed down.\" Jaabir said: \"It was crying because of the dhikr (remembrance of Allaah) that it used to hear.\" (al-Bukhaari, 3319). The tree from which Allaah spoke to Moosa (upon whom be peace) and sent him as a Prophet Allaah says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): \"So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place from the tree: ‘O Moosa! Verily! I am Allaah, the Lord of the ‘Aalameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)!\" [al-Qasas 28:30] The tree from which Allaah forbade our father and mother (Aadam and Hawwa) to eat Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree, otherwise you both will be of the Zaalimoon (unjust and wrong-doers).\" [al-A’raaf 7:19] \"Then Shaytaan whispered to him, saying: ‘O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?\" [Ta-Ha 20:120] \"So He misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to stick together the leaves of Paradise over themselves (in order to cover their shame). And their Lord called out to them (saying): ‘Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily Shaytaan is an open enemy to you?’\" [al-A’raaf 7:22] The cedar tree to which Allaah likened the kaafir (disbeliever) Abu Hurayrah said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The example of the believer is like that of a plant which is continually bent over by the wind; the believer is continually beset with afflictions. The example of a hypocrite is like that of the cedar tree, which does not yield until it is uprooted in one go.\" (Muslim, 5024) The scholars of Arabic language said: the cedar (al-arz) is a tree similar to the stone pine tree, which grows in Syria and Armenia. According to another report, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The example of the kaafir is that of the firmly-rooted cedar which does not yield to anything until it is uprooted in one go.\" The scholars said: The meaning of this hadeeth is that the believer suffers a great deal, in his physical health, with his family and with his wealth, but this is an expiation for his sins and will raise his status. The kaafir, however, suffers little, but even if something happens to him it will not expiate for his sins at all; he will come with a full burden of sin on the Day of Resurrection. The tree in the righteous vision that was narrated concerning the sajdah (prostration) to be performed when reciting certain aayaat of the Qur’aan Ibn ‘Abbaas said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: \"O Messenger of Allaah, last night I had a dream in which it was as if I was praying behind a tree. I prostrated and the tree prostrated after me. I heard it saying: ‘Allaahumma uktub li bihaa ‘indaka ajran wada’ ‘anni bihaa wizran waj’alhaa li ‘indaka dhukhran wa taqabbalha minni kamaa taqabbaltahaa min ‘abdika Daawood (O Allaah, record for me because of it (the sajdah) a reward, alleviate some of my burden, and make it an investment on my behalf with You. Accept it from me as You accepted it from Your slave Daawood).’\" Ibn ‘Abbaas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited an aayah where a sajdah is required, then he prostrated, and I heard him saying the same words that the man had reported that the tree had said. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 528) The two trees which came together to conceal the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was answering the call of nature This was recorded in the saheeh report narrated by Imaam Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him): \"… We stopped in a fragrant valley, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to answer the call of nature. I followed him, bringing a bottle of water, but he could not find anywhere where he could conceal himself. There were two trees at the edge of the valley, so the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to one of them, took hold of one of its branches, and said: ‘Follow me, by the permission of Allaah.’ So it followed him like a camel being led by a rope, until he came to the other tree. He took one of the other tree’s branches and said: ‘Follow me, by the permission of Allaah.’ So it followed him until he reached the halfway point between them, then he put them together and said: ‘Stay together and cover me, by the permission of Allaah.’ So they stayed together.\" Jaabir said: \"I kept away, for fear that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might feel my presence and move even further away. So I sat down, thinking to myself, and when I turned around, I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) coming towards me, and the two trees had separated and taken up their former positions.\" (Saheeh Muslim, 5328) Trees (plants) with foul-smelling \"fruits\" after eating which the Muslims are forbidden to come to the mosque Jaabir said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever eats of these vegetables (the first time he said ‘garlic,’ then ‘garlic, onions and leeks’), let him not come near us in our mosques, for the angels will be offended by whatever offends the people.’\" (al-Nisaa’i, 700) The trees (all except the gharqad) which will show the Jews to the Muslims so that they may kill them during the great battle at the end of time The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The Hour will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. The Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will say: ‘O Muslim, O slave of Allaah! There is a Jews behind me, come and kill him!’ (All the trees will say this except for the gharqad (box-thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews.’\" (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; it is a saheeh hadeeth). These are a number of the trees mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, from which we may learn many lessons. We ask Allaah to help us benefit from these lessons. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

There is no evidence to suggest that this is forbidden, but it is allowed on the condition that no harm is caused to the person who eats it – in which case it would not be allowed, because everything that causes harm is haraam, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and do not throw yourselves into destruction…” [al-Baqarah 2:195].

      "Praise be to Allah.Welcome to a lady who is seeking the true religion and is interested in Islam. We ask Allaah to show you the truth and help you to follow it, and to protect you from Shaytaan and his doubts, and the misguidance of the enemies of Islam. Before I answer your question, I would like to remind you that the way to find out the truth about a religion is to refer to its authentic sources, which in the case of Islam means the Quraan, which is the Word of Allaah, and the Sunnah, which is the words of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to whom Allaah sent Revelation. One of the mistakes made by some of those who investigate Islam is to refer to sources that are not authentic or material written by those who have ulterior motives and who are enemies of Islam spreading lies about it, to put people off and lead them astray from the Way of Allaah. Turning to your question about the Kabah, and Ibraaheem and Ismaaeel (upon whom be peace), it is very strange to say that they removed all the idols from the Kabah except one. This contradicts the historical facts, and does not make sense, because it is known that Ibraaheem and Ismaaeel were the ones who built the Kabah, on the command of Allaah how could they then have taken idols out of it? How could there have been any idols in it when they were supervising its construction and maintenance by remembering Allaah and calling people to perform Tawaaf around it and come on pilgrimage to it only for the sake of Allaah? The idols came many years afterwards, when some of the Arabs travelled to the kaafir lands outside the Arabian Peninsula and brought back idols, some of which were placed around the Kabah. Then the mushrikeen added more idols until there were 360 of them around the Kabah. This remained the case until Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This was the dawning of the light of Tawheed which drove out the darkness of idolatry. Through him, Allaah defeated the mushrikeen; he broke the idols and purified the Sacred House, thus restoring the Kabah to the pure worship of the One God, as it had been at the time of his forefather Ibraaheem, the Friend (Khaleel) of Allaah. There follows an account of the building of the Ancient House, from the Quraan and the Ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). We will begin by quoting from the Quraan, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And (remember) when Ibraaheem said: My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allaah and the Last Day. He (Allaah) answered, As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination! And (remember) when Ibraaheem and (his son) Ismaaeel were raising the foundations of the House (the Kabah), (saying): Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation submissive unto You, and show us our manaasik (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage Hajj and Umrah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful. Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book and al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the Islamic laws and jurisprudence or wisdom or Prophethood, etc.), and sanctify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.\" [al-Baqarah 2:126-129] \"And (remember) when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the (Sacred) House, (saying): Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allaah), and make prostration (in prayer, etc.) And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj).\" [al-Hajj 22:26-27] As regards the story of the construction of the Kabah in the Sunnah, Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated the story of Haajar, the wife of Ibraaheem and the mother of his son Ismaaeel. In his report, he said: \" Ibraaheem brought her and her son Ismaaeel, while she was still breast-feeding him, and left them in a place near the Kabah (meaning near the place where the Kabah was later built) under a tree on the spot of Zamzam (meaning the place where Zamzam later appeared), at the highest place in the mosque. In those days there was no-one in Makkah nor was there any water. So he left them there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a water-skin containing some water, then he set off for home. Ismaaeels mother followed him and said: O Ibraaheem, where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)? She said this many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him, Has Allaah commanded you to do this? He said, Yes. She said, Then He will not forsake us, and returned, while Ibraaheem went on his way. When he reached al-Thaaniyah, where they could not see him, he turned to face the Kabah, raised his hands and offered the supplication: O Our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in an uncultivable valley, by Your Sacred House in order, O Our Lord, that they may perform al-Salaat (iqaamat al-salaat), so fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks. [Ibraaheem 14:37] Ismaaeels mother went on suckling Ismaaeel and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him tossing in agony; she left him because she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safaa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safaa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the mountain of al-Marwa, where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safaa and al-Marwa) seven times.\" Ibn Abbaas said: \"The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: This is the origin of the tradition of al-Saee (the walking) of people between them (al-Safaa and al-Marwa). When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time), she heard a voice and she made herself quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me? And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hands in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water from her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: \"May Allaah bestow mercy on Ismaaeels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further added: \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angels said to her: Dont be afraid of being forsaken, for this is the House of Allaah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allaah never forsakes His people. The House at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way until some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kadaa. They stopped and stayed in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, although we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them about it. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: \"Ismaaeels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you? She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further added: \"Ismaaeels mother was pleased with the whole situation, as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (Ismaaeel) grew up and learnt Arabic from them, and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up. When he reached the age of puberty, they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ismaaeels mother had died, Ibraaheem came after Ismaaeels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before Then Ibraaheem came and saw Ismaaeel under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibraaheem, he stood up to welcome him and they greeted one another as a father greets his son or a son greets his father. Ibraaheem said, O Ismaaeel, Allaah has given me an order. Ismaaeel said: Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Ibraaheem asked, Will you help me? Ismaaeel said, I will help you. Ibraaheem said, Allaah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.\" The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (Kabah). Ismaaeel brought the stones and Ibraaheem was building, and when the walls became high, Ismaaeel brought this stone and put it for Ibraaheem, who stood on it and carried on building, while Ismaaeel was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying: Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. [al-Baqarah 2:127]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, \"Then both of them went on building and going around the Kabah saying, Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.\" (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 3113) Having outlined the historical details of the building of the Kabah, we move on to the idea mentioned in your question that the name of Allaah was derived from the name of an idol. This is an extremely odd idea. How can the name of the Creator, the Evolver, the First, the Almighty, the Compellor be derived from the name of a created idol that could neither benefit nor harm anyone? Allaah says, rebuking the mushrikeen (polytheists) (interpretation of the meaning): \"Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead.\" [al-Furqaan 25:3] \"You worship besides Allaah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allaah have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allaah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back.\" [al-Ankaboot 29:17] Allaah describes how Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace) rebuked his father and his people for worshipping idols (interpretation of the meaning): \"When he said to his father: O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything?\" [Maryam 19:42] \"And recite to them the story of Ibraaheem, when he said to his father and his people: What do you worship? They said: We worship idols, and to them we are ever devoted. He said, Do they hear you, when you call (on them)? Or do they benefit you or do they harm (you)? They said, Nay, but we found our fathers doing so. He said, Do you observe that which you have been worshipping, - you and your ancient fathers? Verily! They are enemies to me, save the Lord of the Aalameen (makind, jinn and everything that exists), Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me.\" [Al-Shuaraa 26:69-78] Concerning Ibraaheems destruction of his peoples idols, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then he turned to their gods and said, Will you not eat (of the offering before you)? What is the matter with you that you speak not? Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand. Then they (the worshippers of idols) came towards him, hastening. He said, Worship you that which you (yourselves) carve? While Allaah has created you and what you make?\" [al-Saaffaat 37:91-96] After reading all this, how can it be said that Ibraaheem left one idol near the Kabah, and that the name of Allaah is derived from the name of an idol? Do you know what \"Allaah\" means and where this name is derived from? The blessed name \"Allaah\" is derived from the Arabic verb alaha/yalahu/malooh [the root of which is the three letters alif, laam, haa]. This verb includes the meaning of love as well as worship. Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the One Who is loved, glorified and feared by the believers, and they put their hope in Him. As regards to your last question, about whether Islam has anything to do with the worship of idols or heavenly bodies, this is a strange matter indeed. Islam proclaimed the absolute unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and taught that He Alone is to be worshipped, with no partners or associates. Islam came to fight idolatry and put an end to it, so how can it possibly be connected to idol-worship? Perhaps you have read in the Quraan the story of the hoopoe who believed only in Allaah; he knew Who his Lord was, and denounced the worship of stars and planets. Allaah says, relating how His Prophet Sulaymaan (upon whom be peace) conveyed the story to the queen of Yemen at that time (interpretation of the meaning): \"[The hoopoe said] and I have come to you from Saba (Sheba) with true news. I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given all things that could be possessed by any ruler of the earth, and she has a great throne. I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allaah, and Shaytaan has made their deeds fair-seeming to them, and has barred them from (Allaahs) Way, so they have no guidance, so that they do not worship (prostrate before) Allaah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!\" [al-Naml 27:22-26] There is also the story of how Ibraaheem rebuked his people for worshipping heavenly bodies, the sun and moon, which Allaah has told us in Soorat al-Anaam (the sixth soorah). The fast of Ramadaan is not connected to the moon because we worship the moon, but because the Lord of the moon has made it a marker of time for us, by which we may organize our worship and other affairs. So we look for the new moon of Ramadaan so that we may worship Allaah Alone by fasting, and we look for the new moon of the following month to mark the end of this annual act of worship. We also look for the timings of Hajj and other acts of worship in a similar way. We hope that this has helped you understand anything that was not clear to you before. Note that this is a serious issue, and it is not something to be taken lightly. The only religion with Allaah is Islam, which He has chosen for His slaves, and He will not accept any other religion. Come and join the religion of truth, and follow what your Lord has revealed.\n",

All that you have to be careful about is that your wife does not go out in front of your brother or be alone with him in the house, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade non-mahrams (unrelated men) to enter upon women. He said: \"Beware of entering upon women.\" One of the Sahaabah said to him, \"O Messenger of Allaah, what about the brother-in-law?\" He said: \"The brother-in-law is death!\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, 9/330). Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: \"What is referred to in the hadeeth is all the husbands (male) relatives apart from his father and sons. People customarily take the matter of a man being alone with his brothers wife as being of little consequence; to indicate the seriousness of the matter, it was likened to death. Indeed, one should be more cautious about the brother-in-law than about a stranger. The phrase \"the brother-in-law is death\" may have a number of meanings: That being alone with a brother-in-law may lead to disaster if a sin is committed, or may spell divorce for the woman if her husband cannot contain his jealousy; Or: Beware of being alone with a non-mahram woman fear this as you fear death. All this stems from Islams keenness to protect households, to avoid evil and to preserve marriages in the best possible way. You will find more details under question #217 .

But if there is the fear that something that is not right may result from it, such as the person who makes the request relying on the person whom he has asked, or always relying on other people with regard to matters in which he should call on his Lord, or there is the fear that the person of whom the request is made may become arrogant and think that he has reached such a level that people ask him to make du’aa’ for them, then this is sufficient reason not to do this, because in this case it leads to something that is not right. If it does not lead to something that is not right, then in principle it is permissible, but still we say that it should not be done, because it was not the custom of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) to ask one another to make du’aa’ for one another. The hadeeth in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is reported to have said to ‘Umar, “Do not forget us in your du’aa’, O my brother” (reported by Abu Dawood, no. 1498, and al-Tirmidhi, no. 3557) is a weak hadeeth and there is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said this. With regard to the fact that the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to make du’aa’ for them, it is well-known that no one else can reach the level of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so when ‘Ukaashah ibn Muhsan asked him to pray that he would be one of those who would enter Paradise without being called to account or being punished, he said, “You will be one of them” (reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 6541; Muslim, no. 216, 218, 220), and when another man came and asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to ask Allaah to send them rain, he did so (reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 1013; Muslim, 897). With regard to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) advising his companions to ask Uways al-Qurani to make du’aa’ for them, this undoubtedly applied only in his case, and it is known that Uways was not on the same level as Abu Bakr or ‘Umar or ‘Uthmaan or ‘Ali, or other Sahaabah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell anyone among his Sahaabah to ask anyone to make du’aa’ for them. To sum up, we can say: there is no sin in asking someone to make du’aa’ for you that you hope will have his du’aa’ answered, on the condition that this does not involve anything that is wrong, but it is better and more appropriate not to do this.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This is a competition, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) thought that there was nothing wrong with competitions on issue of sharee’ah. He explained this by pointing out that jihaad may be either with knowledge or with weapons. He also used as evidence the reports about Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) when the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) “Alif-Laam-Meem. The Romans have been defeated in the nearer land (Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Palestine), and they, after their defeat, will be victorious, within three to nine years…” [al-Room 30:1-4] was revealed. The Persians were the ones who had defeated the Romans; the Romans were Christians, People of the Book, whilst the Persians were Magians (Zoroastrians), who had no revealed Book. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “… And on that day, the believers (i.e., Muslims) will rejoice (at the victory given by Allaah to the Romans against the Persians).” [al-Room 30:4], because the believers wanted the Christians to defeat the Persians as the Christians were People of the Book and therefore closer to Islam than the Magians. Quraysh, on the other hand, wanted the Magians to defeat the Romans, and said, “The Romans cannot defeat the Persians, because the Persians are stronger than they are, and they do not believe in the Qur’aan.” So Abu Bakr bet them a number of camels that (the Romans) would prevail within seven years. The seven years passed and nothing had happened. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) went to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who told him, “Add two years, and increase the bet” (reported by Ibn Jareer in his Tafseer, 10/165, 166, no. 27876) – because the word bid’ used in the aayah refers to any number between three and nine. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to play it safe by increasing the time period and increasing the prize. Abu Bakr did this, and before the two years had passed, travellers brought news that the Romans had defeated the Persians. From this report Shaykh al-Islam deduced that it is permissible to bet in matters of shar’i knowledge.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The four imaams – al-Shaafa’i, Maalik, Abu Haneefah and Imaam Ahmad (according to one opinion narrated from him) – said that the prayer of a person standing alone behind a row is valid, whether the row in front of him is complete or not. They said that the hadeeth “There is no prayer for the one who stands alone behind a row” (reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad, 4/23 and by Ibn Maajah, no. 1003, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Irwa’, no. 514) is like the hadeeth “There is no prayer when there is food prepared” (reported by Muslim, no. 560). The meaning is that the prayer is not proper and complete. But there is a report from Ahmad that the prayer of the person who stands alone behind the row is not valid at all. This is the well-known view in the madhhab of Imaam Ahmad: the prayer of the person who stands alone behind the row is not valid in any circumstances, even if the last row is full. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah took a moderate view, and said: “If the row is full, then the prayer of the one who stands alone behind the row is valid, because in this case he is not able to be a part of the row, and Allaah does not burden a person beyond his scope. If the row is not full, then it is not right for him to pray standing alone behind the row, because he has no excuse.” This is the view of Shaykh al-Islam and of our Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him). This is the view that we think is correct, which is that if the row is full, pray standing on your own, and do not pull someone out of the row to join you or go and stand with the imaam in front. This is the correct opinion, which we think is closer to the Sunnah than the opinion that the prayer of the one who stands on his own is absolutely invalid or is unconditionally valid.

      "Praise be to Allah.When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came from Makkah to Madeenah, he used to face Bayt al-Maqdis when he prayed, and that remained the case for sixteen or seventeen months, as is proven in the two Saheehs (al-Bukhaari and Muslim), in the hadeeth of al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father), who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed towards Bayt al-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen months, and he was hoping that the Qiblah would be towards the House (i.e., the Kabah) Then after that Allaah commanded him to face the direction of the Kabah (the Sacred House), in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): so turn your face in the direction of al-Masjid al-Haraam (at Makkah). And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction [al-Baqarah 2:144]. Before we answer the question about the wisdom behind this change, we must note the following points: When we Muslims hear of a command from Allaah, we must accept it and submit to it, even if the wisdom behind it is not clear to us, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter, that they should have any option in their decision [al-Ahzaab 33:36] Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not give any command without there being great wisdom behind it even if we do not understand it as He says (interpretation of the meaning): That is the judgement of Allaah. He judges between you. And Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Wise. [al-Mumtahinah 60:10] Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, does not abrogate any rule except to replace it with something better or similar to it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): Whatever Verse (revelation) do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allaah is able to do all things? [al-Baqarah 2:106] Having understood this, we may note that the wisdom behind the changing of the Qiblah has several aspects, including: It is a test for the true believer, because the true believer, unlike others, accepts the commands of Allaah. Allaah has spoken of this in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): And We made the Qiblah which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger from those who would turn on their heels. Indeed it was great (heavy) except for those whom Allaah guided [al-Baqarah 2:143] This ummah is the best of nations, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): You are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind [Aal Imraan 3:110]. Confirming the aayat about the Qiblah, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Thus We have made of you (true Muslims) a Wasat (just) (and the best) nation [al-Baqarah 2:143]. Wasat conveys meanings of justice and of being chosen. So Allaah has chosen for this ummah goodness in all things and the best commands and rules, and thus He chose for them the Qiblah of Ibraaheem, upon whom be peace. Imaam Ahmad reported in his Musnad (6/134-135) from Aaishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said about the People of the Book (Jews and Christians): They do not envy us for anything as much as they envy us for Yawm al-Jumuah (Friday), to which Allaah has guided us and from which they have gone astray, and for the Qiblah to which Allaah has guided us and from which they have gone astray, and for our saying Aameen behind the imaam.

      "Contents Related Are earnings haram in Islam? Can men wear silver rings? The prohibition to imitate non-Muslims Praise be to Allah.Are earnings haram in Islam? Earrings and bracelets are forms of adornment for women. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who make themselves look like women and women who make themselves look like men . (Al-Bukhari, 5435) Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who wear women’s clothes and women who wear men’s clothes. (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Libas, Bab fi libas al-nisa) On this basis, it is not permitted for men to wear earrings or nose-rings. The claim that this is permissible because the people of Quraysh used to do that needs to be proven, in the first place, and where is the proof? Even if they used to do this in the Jahiliyyah (Time of Ignorance before Islam), Islam came and forbade men to wear the adornment of women or to make themselves look like them, as is clear from the hadiths quoted above. What matters is the ruling of Islam, not what Quraysh or other tribes may have done. The kinds of female adornment known among Quraysh and others include earrings, bracelets, anklets and bangles worn on the upper arm. The point is that these are known as forms of women’s adornment since ancient times. Can men wear silver rings? Islam has given men sufficient scope to adorn themselves by allowing them to wear silver rings . Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wore a ring made of silver, and the people did likewise. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5417) Islam also allows men to wear gold and silver when necessary to replace a lost tooth or nose, and so on. The prohibition to imitate non-Muslims We would say that any Muslim man who wears jewellery is making himself look like the disbeliever , because this is known to be their style of adornment. The latest fashion among them is to wear earrings and the like in their ears, noses , lips, cheeks and other parts of the body (so-called body-piercing ). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Sunan, Kitab al-libas, Bab libas al-shuhrah). Whoever does this should repent to Allah and not engage in the futile defence of falsehood. He should be distinct in both his personality and his dress from the disbelievers, as Islam has commanded us to be. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Whoever makes any claim about Islamic teachings should produce sound evidence. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Say: ‘Produce your proof if you are truthful.’ ” [al-Baqarah 2:111] So it is not permitted to accept anyone’s opinion without evidence or proof. What evidence is there that a Muslim should visit Makkah seven times and Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) once in his lifetime?! Allaah has made it a duty to perform Hajj once in a lifetime. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O people, Allaah has made Hajj a duty upon you, so perform Hajj.” A man asked, “(Should we do it) every year, O Messenger of Allaah?” but he remained silent. The man asked the question three times, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If I say yes, it will be obligatory for you, and you will not be able to do it.” Then he said: “Do not push me to tell you more than I have told you. Those who came before you were destroyed because they asked too many questions and argued with their Prophets. If I command you to do something, then do as much of it as you can, and if I forbid you to do something, then leave it well alone.” (Reported by Muslim, 2380) Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And perform properly (i.e., all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e., the Pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah…” [al-Baqarah 2:196] The person who performs Hajj and ‘Umrah once in his lifetime does not have to do them again, but it is encouraged to repeat Hajj and ‘Umrah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Follow up one Hajj or ‘Umrah with another, for they eliminate poverty and sins as the fire eliminates dross from iron, gold and silver. An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.” (Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, al-Sunan, 738). The Muslim who is capable and healthy is encouraged not to stay away from the Ancient House (i.e., the Ka’bah) for too long, as Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah says: ‘If a slave to whom I have given good health and ample provision does not come to visit Me once every five years, he is indeed deprived.’” (Reported by Ibn Hibbaan and others; see Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1909). All of the above reports indicate that frequent visits to Makkah are encouraged, but they are not obligatory. As far as visiting Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) is concerned, if a Muslim never visits it in his lifetime, there is nothing wrong with that. There are no obligatory acts of worship connected with it, but it is the third of the great Mosques which a Muslim is permitted to travel to visit; it is not permitted to travel to any other place for the purpose of prayer and worship, except these three mosques. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No one should set out on a journey (of pilgrimage) except to three mosques: Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah], the Mosque of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Masjid al-Aqsaa [in Jerusalem].” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1115). The reward for praying in Masjid al-Aqsaa will be multiplied over the reward for praying in any other mosque, apart from Masjid al-Haram in Makkah and Masjid al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (The Prophet’s Mosque) in Madeenah. The author of Mughni al-Muhtaaj said: “It has been proven that prayer in Masjid al-Aqsaa is worth five-hundred times more than other prayers, as was reported by Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr; al-Bazzaar said: its isnaad is hasan.” Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘One prayer in this Mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers in any other mosque except for al-Masjid al-Haram, and one prayer in al-Masjid al-Haram is better than one hundred thousand prayers offered elsewhere.’” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3838).

The scholars said: “The child should be taught about tahaarah (purity and cleanliness, i.e., wudoo’ etc) and prayer when he reaches the age of ten years.” The meaning of discipline or instruction is to smack (lightly when and if necessary), threaten and rebuke. The child’s guardian should teach him about tahaarah and salaat (prayer), and tell the child to do these things, when he reaches the age of seven, and he should discipline him and force him to do them when he reaches the age of ten. The guiding principle here is the hadeeth (narration)of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Teach the child to pray when he is seven, and smack him (lightly)if he does not pray when he is ten.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is a hasan/sound hadeeth). According to another report, he said: “Tell the child to pray when he is seven, and smack him (lightly) if he does not do it when he is ten, and separate them in their beds.” This training is ordained by Islam to teach the prayer and let the child get used to praying, so that he will be accustomed to it and will not forget it when he reaches puberty. There is no difference between boys and girls in this matter of discipline. (See Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah, Baab sifat al-salaat). Some people may not feel comfortable about disciplining orphans, but the right approach is for their guardian to teach them and direct them in whatever way is beneficial, even if this involves being harsh with the child for his own sake. There is nothing wrong with that, as the poet said: “He was harsh so that they would understand. Let the one who is determined and resolved be harsh sometimes towards those for whom he cares.” The scholars said: “(A guardian) has the right to (lightly) smack an orphan under his care just as he would (lightly) smack his own child.” (See Al-durr al-mukhtaar: Baab al-ta’zeer).

And if only they had said, ‘We hear and obey,’ and ‘Do make us understand,’ it would have been better for them, and more proper, but Allaah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except for a few.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:46] The phrase “[they] displace words from (their) right places” means that they misinterpret them and understand them in a way that Allaah did not intend, doing this deliberately and inventing lies against Allaah. [Tafseer Ibn Katheer] Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “So because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them. And you will not cease to discover deceit in them, except a few of them. But forgive them, and overlook (their misdeeds). Verily, Allaah loves al-Muhsineen (good-doers).” [al-Maa’idah 5:13] The phrase “because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them” refers to the fact that they broke the Covenant which had been made with them, so Allaah cursed them, i.e., He kept them away from following the True Guidance. “[We] made their hearts grow hard” means that they will not benefit from any preaching because their hearts are so hard. “They change the words from their (right) places” means that they play havoc with the words of Allaah and misinterpret His Book, taking it to mean things that were never meant and attributing to Allaah things that He never said; may Allaah protect us from that. “[They] have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them” means that they stopped following its teachings because they did not want to follow them. Al-Hasan said: “They did not adhere to their religion or keep their duties towards Allaah, without which no deeds are acceptable to Him; their fitrah (innate nature) was not sound and their deeds were not righteous.” [Tafseer Ibn Katheer] So it becomes quite clear that the ways in which the Children of Israel tampered with the Tawraat and Injeel include the following: Changing Omitting Adding things and attributing to Allaah words that He did not say Misinterpreting the words of Allaah. When Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent, the original Tawraat and Injeel had already been altered and distorted. Allaah revealed the Qur’aan to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and guaranteed that He Himself would preserve it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Qur’aan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption).” [al-Hijr 15:9] This distinguishing feature was not found in any Book before the Qur’aan. From the time of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the present (more than fourteen hundred years) the Qur’aan has stayed the same, and not a single letter of it has been changed, as ancient manuscripts and the hearts of generation after generation of people who have memorized the entire text and earned the title of “haafiz” bear witness. We ask Allaah to guide us to the true and straight path. And Allaah knows best.\n",

Allah has permitted us all the produce of the sea . Hence we know that all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc. {Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food} [al-Maidah 2:96 interpretation of the meaning]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that it is halal (lawful) to eat dead creatures from the sea and dead fish , and no part of the fish was excluded from this permission. Can you eat fish eyes? Hence we know that all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc. It is strange indeed that a person could dare to forbid something that Allah has permitted. This is a very serious matter, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who believe! Make not unlawful the tayyibat (all that is good) which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.} [al-Maidah 5:87] {Say: Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-Tayyibat [all kinds of halal (lawful) things] of food? Say: They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them). Thus We explain the ayat (Islamic law) in detail for people who have knowledge.} [al-A’raf 7:32] {Say: Tell me, what provision Allah has sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful. Say: has Allah permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allah?} [Yunus 10:59] Allah has also warned His slave against forbidding anything without knowledge. He said (interpretation of the meaning): {And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: This is lawful and this is forbidden, so as to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper.} [al-Nahl 16:116] This person who has invented a lie against Allah by saying that it is haram to eat the eye of a fish must repent to Allah, and not go beyond the limits in talking about the Religion of Allah. He should not speak without knowledge. Even if he is put off by something or feels disgusted by it, he has no right to say that it is haram. Disliking certain foods does not mean prohibiting them The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hated the smell of garlic, and said: Whoever eats anything from this unpleasant plant should not approach us in the mosque. The people said, “It has become haram (forbidden), it has become haram.” When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard what was being said, he said: O people, it is not for me to forbid something that Allah has permitted; this is just a vegetable whose smell is unpleasant. (Reported by Ahmad and Muslim, 877) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that the fact that he disliked garlic and told people not to come to the mosque after eating it did not mean that it was haram. Although the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked the idea of eating lizard-meat, he did not forbid others to eat it, as is reported in the following story: Khalid ibn al-Walid reported that some grilled lizard meat was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and put in front of him. He stretched out his hand to take some, but one of the people present said, O Messenger of Allah, it is lizard meat, so he pulled his hand back. Khalid ibn al-Walid asked, O Messenger of Allah, is lizard haram? He said, No, but it is not known among my people and I cannot face eating it. So Khalid took some of the lizard meat and ate it, whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked on. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4981, al-Nasai, 4242, and Abu Dawud, 3300) After explaining this answer to you, I want to warn you about something that I noticed in your question, where you said that you went to the seafood restaurant with a male friend. If this person is not your husband or a mahram (blood-relative whom you are permanently forbidden to marry), then you should fear Allah. Ask yourself: which is more serious, eating the eye of a fish or going out with a man to whom you are not related to sit and chat with him in a restaurant? I ask Allah to protect us from all things that earn His wrath and to help us remember and fear Him. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

      "Praise be to Allah.If a woman refuses her husband’s request to come to bed with no Islamically-sound reason (such as sickness, or his being drunk, for example), what happens is as described below: Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses [and does not come], and he spends the night angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning.’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4794; the additional phrase quoted in square brackets is from Abu Dawood, al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Nikaah, Bab haqq al-zawj ‘ala’l-mar’ah). In the phrase “if a man calls his wife to his bed,” the word “bed” is obviously a metaphor for intercourse. Metaphors are used in the Qur’aan and Sunnah to refer to things about which people usually feel shy. Does this apply only to the nighttime, or does it include daytime too? The answer may be found in a hadeeth narrated by Muslim: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is above the heavens [i.e. Allaah] will be angry with her, until he (her husband) is pleased with her.” Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibbaan report a hadeeth narrated by Jaabir: “There are three whose prayers will not be accepted and none of whose good deeds will ascend to heaven: a runaway slave, until he returns to his master; a drunken man until he becomes sober; and a woman with whom her husband is angry, until he is pleased with her.” These are general terms, which include both night and day. The phrase “and he spends the night angry with her” refers to the cause of the angels’ curse, because this confirms that she is a sinner, which is a different matter than if he accepts her excuse and is not angry with her, or lets the matter drop. Is she to blame if he keeps her away from his bed? The answer is: no, unless she is the one who started the separation and he is keeping away from her because of it, and she did not apologize but prolonged the separation. But if he is the one who started it, and is thus treating her unfairly, then she is not to blame. In one report, instead of the words “the angels curse her until morning,” the wording is “… until she returns” – and this is a useful variant. This hadeeth tells us that denying a spouse’s rights – whether physical or financial – is something that will inevitably bring about the wrath of Allaah, unless Allaah grants His mercy to the sinner. We also learn that the angels will pray against a sinner so long as he or she persists in the sin. The hadeeth also directs a wife to help her husband and seek his satisfaction, because a man is less patient than a woman when it comes to doing without intercourse. The most disturbing thing for a man is his sexual impulse, so Islam urges women to help their husbands in this regard. (Adapted and abbreviated from the commentary by al-Haafiz Ibn Hijr – may Allaah have mercy on him – on this hadeeth in Fath al-Baari). Whether the husband wants to discipline his wife, or forgive her, or take another wife, or divorce her, this is all up to him to choose. Let the woman beware of incurring her husband’s wrath because this will lead to Allaah’s being angry with her. We ask Allaah to rectify this situation. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

So long as he does not divorce her, she is his wife. The marital contract is not cancelled by a lack of love between the spouses or by whatever disputes and differences there may be between them. It can only be cancelled if her husband divorces her or the marriage is annulled. Both partners should fear Allaah, and the husband should treat his wife decently. If he dislikes her, he should either keep her and treat her decently, or let her go in a proper manner. The wife should fear Allaah, give her husband his rights, put up with his bad treatment and obey him in things that are good and proper. And Allaah knows best.

Perhaps your background of having lived in Saudi Arabia will help you with this. I advise you to concentrate on teaching them about Tawheed and correct Islamic ‘aqeedah (belief), explaining how to do acts of worship from a Fiqh point of view, and teaching them the biographies of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions. As for the matter which you raised in your question, letting boys and girls sit together facing one another in one halaqah is not free from dangers, as you know. I think that you feel the same way, which is what made you ask this question, especially when we expect that the hijaab of the girls where you live is incomplete and that the faces of some of them, at least, are uncovered in front of the boys. For this reason I suggest one of two things: either get the girls to sit behind the boys, wearing full hijaab, so that you don’t feel embarrassed when you face the group to give a lesson; or put up a barrier or screen between the boys and girls, such that they can still hear your voice, if the girls do not want to wear full hijaab. Then they can ask questions from behind the screen, so long as they are not soft in speech, or they can write questions on pieces of paper.

      "Related Praise be to Allah.It seems that your friend, in his ignorance of the true nature of Prophethood, does not make a distinction between a Prophet and an astrologer, and so he compares the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the astrology of the French physicist Nostradamus who lived in the 16th century CE and composed books of fantasies and illusions. His books are written in ambiguous language about events that will happen up until the end of the world, which he expected would happen in the year 3797. A person like this needs to understand the true nature of Prophethood and why mankind needs to believe in it, and he needs to know that the Unseen can only be known through the Prophets who were chosen by Allaah. He needs to know that Prophethood is a gift from Allaah, may He be glorified, and it cannot be attained by a person’s desires or own efforts. Prophethood is a pure blessing from Allaah, as is indicated in His words (interpretation of the meanings): “Those were they unto whom Allaah bestowed His Grace from along the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nooh…” [Maryam 19:58] “Thus will your Lord choose you…” [Yoosuf 12:6] “… I have chosen you above men by My Messages and by My speaking (to you)…” [al-A’raaf 7:144] “… Allaah knows best with whom to place His Message…” [al-An’aam 6:124] Then he should realize that the way in which Allaah conveys His message to His Prophets and Messengers is by wahy (revelation). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have inspired you (O Muhammad) as We inspired Nooh and the Prophets after him…” [al-Nisa’ 4:163]. There is nothing wrong with explaining to him the three types or levels of wahy so that he may have a better understanding of this channel of communication between Allaah and His creation, which is so essential for mankind. These three types or levels have been mentioned by Allaah in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “It is not given to any human being that Allaah should speak to him unless (it be) by Inspiration, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise.” [al-Shooraa 42:51] These three types or levels may be further explained as follows: Inspiring something in the heart of a Prophet in such a way that he has no doubt about it and is certain that it is from Allaah. It was reported in a hadeeth that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The holy spirit (i.e., Jibreel) blew into my heart that no soul dies until its provision (rizq) and appointed time have expired, so fear Allaah and be polite and reasonable when you seek to earn a living from others.” (Reported by Ibn Hibbaan). This type of revelation also includes the visions of the Prophets, which are true, as is proven in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah Umm al-Mu’mineen (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: “The first thing that happened to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) of wahy was true vision in his dreams: he did not see something but it would become as true as daybreak.” (Agreed upon). Therefore the Prophet and Friend of Allaah, Ibraaheem, hastened to sacrifice his son when he saw that he was commanded to do so in a dream. He took this dream as being a revelation to him, as Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): “So We gave him the glad tidings of a forbearing boy. And, when he (his son) was old enough to walk with him, he said, ‘O my son! I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice to Allaah), so look what you think!’ He said: ‘O my father! Do that which you are commanded, in sha Allaah (if Allaah will) you will find me of al-saabireen (the patient ones).’ Then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the Will of Allaah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (or on the side of his forehead, for slaughtering), And We called out to him: ‘O Ibraaheem! You have fulfilled the dream (vision)! Verily, thus do We reward the muhsinoon (good-doers). Verily, that was a manifest trial, And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice (a ram).” [al-Saaffaat 37:101-107] Speaking to His Messengers from behind a barrier. Allaah spoke thus to Moosa, upon whom be peace, as He says (interpretation of the meanings): “And when Moosa came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord spoke to him…” [al-A’raaf 7:143] “And when he came to it (the fire), he was called by name, ‘O Moosa! Verily, I am your Lord! So take off your shoes, you are in the sacred valley, Tuwa. And I have chosen you. So listen to that which is inspired to you. Verily, I am Allaah! None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me, and perform al-salaat (prayer) for My Remembrance.’”[Ta-Ha 20:12-14] Revelation to a Prophet via an angel. This is what Allaah refers to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “… or He sends a Messenger to reveal what He wills by His leave…” [al-Shoora 42:51]. This messenger is Jibreel, upon whom be peace. The angel came to the Prophet in three forms as is proven in the shar’i texts. These three forms are: The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him in the form in which Allaah created him. This happened to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) twice. The revelation came with a noise like the sound of a bell, which went away after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had understood what he had said. The angel appeared in the form of a man and spoke to him, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) understood what he said. This was the easiest of the three ways for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This what happened the first time Jibreel came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Cave of Hira’. Then you should tell your friend something of the evidence of the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his miracles (see Question # 2114), the chief of which is the Qur’aan. There is no harm in giving him a copy of the translation of its meanings. If he believes, then praise be to Allaah, and if he remains a disbeliever after this, then he will bear the consequences of his kufr and will be one of the losers, so do not worry about him, for Allaah is independent of all creatures.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If you want to look for a wife for someone, or a husband for a woman, then you can ask him about his wishes, such as the desired age, level of education, employment situation, country and origin and position of the family, and whether he has any preferences about her general appearance, such as skin colour, height, etc. The most important characteristic to ask about is a person’s level of commitment to Islam. This kind of useful question is fine. But asking for details of a person’s past and wanting to know what sins they might have committed when they were ignorant about Islam – this is not right at all. Allaah covers people’s sins and loves to see them covered (i.e., not dragged out into the open). So long as a person has repented, his sins have been wiped out. Islam deletes whatever came before, so why should we ask questions that will only embarrass people? Allaah accepts people’s repentance without their having to confess or expose their sins to any other person. A number of the Sahaabah had committed adultery and murder repeatedly, or had buried infant girls alive, or stolen things, but when they entered Islam they were the best of people. No one needs to be reminded of a shameful past; it is over and done with, and Allaah is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. What matters when considering a person for marriage is how that person is now: is he righteous or not? Has he cut all ties with his past and his wrong deeds, or not? If he is clearly living a good and righteous life now, then it is wrong to dig up the past. If there is any fear of anything that could have future implications, such as certain diseases and so on, then there are medical tests which can give the answer and put your mind at rest. As far as giving a detailed description of a prospective wife to someone is concerned, this can be done in writing: one of her mahram relatives (i.e. a blood relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden) or a woman who knows her can write down a description, then a trustworthy person can deliver it to one who is seriously considering a marriage proposal. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman should describe another woman to her husband as if he can see her.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4839) The wisdom behind this prohibition is the fact that a husband might like the sound of what he hears, so he may divorce the one who described the other to him, or there may be temptation to do wrong.

There is no phrase in this du’aa’ like “al-darajah al-‘aaliyah al-rafee’ah (the high and elevated status),” so this should not be said. The conjunction “wa” in the phrase “al-waseelata wa’l-fadeelah (the privilege and also the eminence) is by way of explanation; waseelah is the status higher than the rest of creation. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained it in the hadeeth narrated by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas, who said that he heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “When you hear the muezzin and say something like he says, then send blessings on me, whoever sends blessings on me, Allaah will send blessings tenfold on him. Then ask Allaah to grant me al-waseelah, for it is a status in Paradise that only one of the slaves of Allaah will reach, and I hope that I will be the one. Whoever asks for al-waseelah for me will be granted intercession.” (Reported by Muslim, 577). The “praised position”(maqaam mahmood) is intercession before Allaah so that He will start to judge between His slaves, and no one will be granted this except Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This is mentioned in the words of Allaah addressed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): “Perform al-salaah from mid-day till the darkness of the night (i.e., the Zuhr, ‘Asr, Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers), and recite the Qur’aan in the early dawn (i.e., the morning prayer). Verily, the recitation of the Qur’aan in the early dawn is ever witnessed (attended by the angels in charge of mankind of the day and the night). And in some parts of the night (also) offer the salaah (prayer) with it (i.e., recite the Qur’aan in the prayer), as an additional prayer (tahajjud – optional prayer) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to maqaaman mahmoodah (a station of praise and glory, i.e., the highest degree in Paradise).” [al-Isra’ 17:78-79] It is called al-maqaam al-mahmood because all of creation will praise Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for that status, because his intercession will ease their distress on that terrible day by setting the process of judgement in motion.

People who are sick may also be permitted to wear silk to relieve their suffering, as Anas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) allowed ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf and Ibn al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them both) to wear silk because of a skin irritation that they suffered from. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 10/295, and Muslim, 3/1646) The scholars also allowed men to wear garments containing four fingers’ width of silk, because of the hadith of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the wearing of silk except for an area the width of two fingers, or three or four.” (Reported by Muslim, 3/1644) With regard to the matters mentioned in the question, the issue is not what a thing is called but what it really is. If the item that a man is going to wear is made of natural silk, then it is not permissible for him to wear it, no matter how it looks or feels, and no matter whether it is a shirt, pants, socks, a necktie or anything else. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Mankind is in need of Messengers and Prophets from Allaah, to light the way and guide them to ways of peace, and to warn them against the ways of evil and corruption. Some of the things for which mankind clearly needs Messengers and Prophets are: 1 - Guidance to Allaah, may He be exalted and glorified Mankind has gone through periods where they did not have Messengers and Messages from Allaah for a long time, and so they fell into the traps of illusions and myths, so they prayed to natural phenomena and heavenly bodies, or idols that could neither benefit nor harm them, worshipping them in fear and hope. At the same time, they were subjected to humiliation by those who claimed divinity, such as the Pharaohs and others. Even though there was never a time when at least a few people wondered about Who had sovereignty over the heavens and the earth and instinctively realized that there was a Creator, they still failed to worship Him properly and heed His commands and prohibitions and understand what He wanted them to do and not do, because they had no contact with anybody who could tell that about all that. The wisdom of Allaah dictated that He should save the confused and misguided by blessing them with the knowledge of His Divine qualities and Beautiful Names, so He honoured them and all of humanity by sending Messengers who would guide them towards the Creator, as He tells us in the story of Nooh (peace be upon him): \"Indeed, We sent Nooh to his people and he said, 'O my people! Worship Allaah! You have no other ilaah (god) but Him. Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a Great Day!'\" [al-A'raaf 7:59]. All the Prophets and Messengers, peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them, came one after the other, bringing the same Message. 2 - Guidance regarding the Hereafter One of the reasons why Prophets and Messengers were sent was to tell people about the Hereafter, because if man does not believe in Allaah and the Last Day, he will be a slave to his desires, running after material things and following the ways of misguidance. If he is reminded or advised, he will deny that he is answerable for his deeds. Allaah has described such people in His words (interpretation of the meaning): \"And they say, 'There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except al-dahr (the time).' And they have no knowledge of it, they only conjecture.\" [al-Jaathiyah 45:24]. So it was the task of the Prophets and Messengers to establish proof of the Last Day, and to explain that the One Who created mankind from nothing is able to bring them back to life after their death, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Say: 'Allaah gives you life, then causes you to die, then He will assemble you on the Day of Resurrection about which there is no doubt. But most of mankind know not.\" [al-Jaathiyah 45:26]. On that Day, the scales of justice will be set up and scores between oppressors and their victims will be settled. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And We shall set up balances of justice on the Day of Resurrection, then none will be dealt with unjustly in anything. And if there be the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it. And Sufficient are We as Reckoners.\" [al-Anbiya' 21:47]. If it were not for this Reckoning, which we know about only through Prophethood, life would be pointless and a means only for wrongdoing - and this is contrary to the wisdom of Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. 3 - Meeting man's need for religion So long as man remains sound of nature, clear of mind and pure of heart, his need for religion remains a part of him, and he understands that there has to be an Almighty Creator who created and organized the universe in the best way. Thus there emerges from the depths of his being the urge to submit himself fully to the Creator, to seek His help at times of calamity and distress, and to humble himself before Him, as he feels his great need for Him both at times of ease and of hardship. This is referred to in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): \"So set your face towards the religion of pure Islamic monotheism haneefa (worship none but Allaah Alone), Allaah's fitrah (pattern) with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in khalq-illah [i.e., the Religion of Allaah], that is the straight religion, but most of men know not.\" [al-Room 30:30] According to a hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), \"Every new-born baby is born according to the fitrah, then his parents make him into a Jew or a Christian or a Magian (Zoroastrian)\" (Agreed upon). How could a man know how to become religious and worship his Creator without Revelation from Allaah to tell him about it? There has to be a mediator between Allaah and His creation so that mankind can know about the religion which the Creator wants them to follow; this is the role of the Prophets. 4 - Guidance regarding proper ways of dealing with one another It is well known that man is by nature sociable, and that he has wishes and desires that cannot be achieved except in cooperation with his fellow-man. So it is clear that mankind urgently needs guidance to regulate his relationships with others, to outline the right way of behaving, to resolve disputes and conflicts, to guard against wrong-doing and oppression, and to protect people's rights - lest some people oppress others. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scriptures and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice\" [al-Hadeed 57:24]. 5 - Guidance towards sound morals It is also a part of man's nature that he will strive to fulfil his needs even if he does so by means of oppression and domination. So he urgently needs a deterrent, in the form of belief in Allaah and the Last Day, to motivate him to acquire good qualities and praiseworthy morals. These can only be known through the divine laws brought and conveyed by the Prophets and Messengers of Allaah, peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them. 6 - Achieving justice in accordance with the will of Allaah It is well known that Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, is Fair and Just. He rewards the one who does good as a blessing and favour from Him, and He punishes the one who does wrong as an act of justice on His part. Allaah, by His wisdom and mercy, sent His Messengers, from Aadam to Muhammad (may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them all) to establish proof (so that people would have no excuse). Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): \"And if We had destroyed them with a torment before this (i.e., Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Qur'aan), they would surely have said, 'Our Lord! If only You had sent us a Messenger, we should certainly have followed Your aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), before we were humiliated and disgraced.'\" [Ta-Ha 20:134] \"Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order that mankind should have no plea against Allaah after the Messengers\" [al-Nisa' 4:165] Allaah, Who is the Most Just of judges, has decreed that He will not punish a nation until He has sent a Messenger to them, as He says: \"Whoever goes right, then he goes right only for the benefit of his own self. And whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to his own loss. No one laden with burdens can bear another's burden. And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).\" [al-Isra' 17:15] The above should explain the extent of mankind's need for Messengers and their Messages, and why their happiness in this world and the next is connected to that. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permitted for the Muslim who believes in Allaah as his Lord, Islam as his religion, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) as a Prophet and Messenger, and in the divine decree, both good and bad, to think that any being, entity or quality can have a specific effect in bringing good or warding off harm, as there is no evidence in shareeah to that effect. This is part of the legacy of jaahiliyyah (ignorance) which has been cancelled out by Islam and is regarded as being shirk which negates perfect Tawheed, because it is insinuating thoughts (waswaas) and scare tactics from the Shaytaan. It is like the attitude of the people of Pharaoh, about whom Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): But whenever good came to them, they said, Ours is this. And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moosa and those with him [al-Araaf 7:131]. If some disaster or drought befell them, they blamed it on evil omens which they associated with Moosa and the believers with him, but Allaah refuted this and said (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, their evil omens are with Allaah [al-Araaf 7:131]. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: Their evil omens means what He decreed for them; they were the cause of what happened to them because of their kufr and rejection of the signs and messengers of Allaah. Many ahaadeeth were reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in which he forbade pessimism and superstitious belief in evil omens. The word tatayyur (pessimism) is derived from teer (birds), because some birds were viewed as evil omens, then the word came to be applied to everything that is taken as a bad sign. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, No adwaa [transmission of infectious diease without the permission of Allaah], no tiyarah [superstitious belief in bird omens], no haamah [refers to a Jaahili Arab tradition described variously as: a worm that infests the grave of a murder victim until he is avenged; an owl; or the bones of a dead person turned into a bird that could fly], and no Safar [the month of Safar was regarded as unlucky in the Jaahiliyyah]. [Translators notes in square brackets]. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5757, and Muslim, 2220.] Muslim added in one of his reports: And no naw (star promising rain) and no ghool (evil demon living in the desert). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) denounced adwaa, the Jaahili belief that attributed sickness to something other than Allaah and said that the sickness could transmit itself without the decree of Allaah. He explained that all of that happens by the decree of Allaah, and that people are instructed to avoid the causes of disaster if they are in good health. The words no Safar, according to one of the interpretations given by the scholars, refer to the month of Safar, which the people of the Jaahiliyyah viewed with pessimism as being unlucky, as was reported in Sunan Abi Dawood (3914) from Muhammad ibn Raashid from someone who heard him say: The people of the Jaahiliyyah used to regard Safar as inauspicious, and said that it was an unlucky month. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) refuted that. Imaam Ibn Rajab (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Regarding Safar as inauspicious is a kind of superstition that is forbidden. Also forbidden is regarding particular days, such as Wednesdays, as inauspicious, or following the Jaahili custom of regarding Shawwaal as inauspicious for weddings. No doubt this also includes the superstitions about the number 13 mentioned in the question. There is no indication in the Quraan or Sunnah that this number should be regarded as inauspicious in any way. The thirteenth is just an ordinary day, like any other day, and anything that happens on such a day happens by divine decree; Allaah decreed that it should happen on that day in that way. If a person tried to spend his time counting the numbers of days or dates on which calamities befell the Muslim ummah, he might find some patterns in some instances, but this has nothing to do with bad luck because of certain numbers or dates on which those events happened. The remedy for this kind of waswaas is for a person to strengthen his heart, have certain faith (yaqeen) in Allaah and put his trust in Him. He should know that no disaster happens except by the decree of Allaah, and he should beware of getting carried away with this waswaas from the Shaytaan or these ideas that may cross his mind. He may be punished with the very thing that he is fearing, because he is turning away from having faith in Allaah and the belief that all good is in His hands, and that He Alone is the one who wards off harm by His power and grace. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us the kafaarah (expiation) to be offered by the one who indulges in any kind of superstitious pessimism. Abd-Allaah ibn Amr reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever lets tiyarah (superstition) stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk. They said, What is the kafaarah (expiation) for that? He said, To say: Allaahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allaah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You). And Allaah knows best. As this issue is widespread among people nowadays, there is no harm in going into further detail, as follows: In the Name of Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful Tiyarah and Fal (Bad omens and good omens) [1] Tiyarah (seeing bad omens) comes from the word tayr (birds) [because the ancient Arabs used to see omens in the movements of birds and other creatures Translator], and is the opposite of fal (good omens). The Arabs all used to have the same ideas about fal and tiyarah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) approved of and encouraged the idea of seeing good omens, but he disapproved and forbade the idea of seeing bad omens. [2] Al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salaam said: The difference between al-tiyarah and al-tatayyur is that tatayyur means feeling in one's heart that something bad is going to happen, whilst tiyarah means acting on the basis of those pessimistic feelings. [3] Tiyarah existed long before Islam. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): But whenever good came to them, they said, Ours is this. And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moosa and those with him [al-Araaf 7:131]. [4] Types of superstitious belief in bad omens, ancient and modern: Certain days or months, such as Safar and Shawwaal. Certain birds, such as crows and owls. Certain animals, such as snakes, black cats and monkeys, or their movements, such as the passing of gazelles. Certain types of people, such as a one-eyed man or a hunchback. Certain numbers, such as 13 among the Christians, 7 among the Bedouin and 10 among the Raafidis; in the latter case because they dislike the asharah mubashsharah (the ten Sahaabah who were given the certain promise of Paradise) with the exception of Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him). Hence they will say Nine plus one instead of ten. Certain sounds, such as the voice of a crow or the sound of an ambulance or fire truck. Frightening or disturbing dreams. Colours, such as the colour of blood, or yellow. When the eyelashes of the left eye tremble involuntarily, they say, Something bad is going to happen to us. Calling a child by the name of a living person, such as the father or mother and so on. Witnessing an accident or a fire in the morning. Seeing ones wifes mother in the morning. When the right hand or right foot itches. [5] The virtue of tawakkul (putting ones trust in Allaah) and not indulging in tiyarah. The Prophet ( peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Seventy thousand people will enter Paradise without being called to account and without being punished. Among the virtues of these people, he described them as not believing in tiyarah and as putting their trust in Allaah. (Reported by Muslim). [6] Condemnation of tiyarah and explanation that it is a kind of shirk. Ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Al-tiyarah is shirk, and he said it three times. (Reported by Abu Dawood and others, and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani). Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: He is not one of us who does tiyarah or has it done for himself Al-Albaani said: Its isnaad is hasan. Ibn al-Qayyim said: Tiyarah is a kind of shirk and a way in which the Shaytaan influences and scares a person. It is very serious for the one who takes it to heart and pays too much attention to it, but it is insignificant for the one who pays no attention to it and is not concerned about it. [7] Negation of tiyarah and superstition. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no adwaa (contagion) or tiyarah, but I like righteous fal. (Muslim). And he said, No adwaa, no tiyarah, no haamah, and no Safar. (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Muaawiyah ibn al-Hakam al-Salami reported that he said to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Some of us believe in tiyarah. He said, That is something that any of you may feel in himself, but it should not stop you from doing anything. (Muslim). So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that any anxiety suffered because of tiyarah is all in the mind and has nothing to do with the object that caused the fear. It is the persons own illusion, fear and shirk that is affecting him and stopping him from doing what he wants to do, not the thing that he saw or heard. Whoever adheres firmly to the bonds of Tawheed and puts all his trust in Allaah, thus nipping the ideas of tiyarah in the bud before they take hold, will be successful and happy in this world and the next. In a saheeh hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Leave any ideas of tiyarah as they are [i.e., do not take them any further]. (Saheeh Abi Dawood). What this hadeeth means is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted them not to pay attention to such ideas, but to leave them alone, as Allaah had made them, because they can bring neither benefit nor harm. Ibn Jareer said: What this means is to leave birds (tayr) alone without shooing them away, and carry on with one's own business, because shooing them away does not bring any benefit or ward off any harm. Ikrimah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: We were sitting with Ibn Abbaas when a bird flew over us and screeched. A man who was there said, Good! Ibn Abbaas said to him, It is neither good nor bad. He hastened to rebuke him lest he think that it had any influence for good or evil. Taawoos set out on a journey with one of his friends, and a crow screeched. The man said, Good! Taawoos said, What is the good in that? Do not accompany me any further. Ibn Abd al-Hakam said: Muzaahim said, When Umar ibn Abd al-Azeez set out from Madeenah, I looked and saw that the moon was in Hyades [a group of stars in Taurus], and I did not want to tell him that, so I just said to him, Look how beautiful the moon looks tonight. Umar looked, and saw that the moon was in Hyades, and said, It is as if you wanted to tell me that the moon was in Hyades. O Muzaahim, we do not go out by the help of the sun or the moon; we go out by the help of Allaah, al-Waahid, al-Qahhaar. [8] The limits of tiyarah. The kind of tiyarah that makes a person go ahead with his plans or stops him from going ahead is the kind of tiyarah that is prohibited. As for the good omens (fal) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) liked, this is a kind of optimism that a person does not feel dependent upon, unlike things that may make a person either go ahead or change his plans, in which a person is in a sense depending upon it. And Allah knows best. [9] Kafaarah (expiation) for one who engages in tiyarah. Imaam Ahmad reported in his Musnad and Ibn al-Sunni also reported with a saheeh isnaad from Abd-Allaah ibn Amr that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever lets tiyarah stop him from doing something is guilty of shirk. They said, What is the kafaarah for that? He said, To say: Allaahumma la khayra illaa khayruka wa laa tayra illaa tayruka wa laa ilaaha ghayruka (O Allaah, there is no good except Your good, no birds except Yours, and there is no god beside You). no birds except Yours means: the birds are part of Your creation, they can bring neither benefit nor harm, and the only One Who can bring benefit or harm is You, may You be glorified. [10] Remedies for tatayyur: (a) tawakkul, which means delegating all ones affairs to Allaah and relying on Him, whilst at the same time taking the necessary means and precautions. This is an obligation which must be done purely and sincerely for Allaah, because it is one of the best forms of worship and highest levels of Tawheed. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): and put your trust in Allaah, if you are believers indeed. [al-Maaidah 5:23] and And put yout trust in the Ever-Living One Who dies not, and glorify His Praises, and Sufficient is He as the All-Knower of the sins of His slaves. [al-Furqaan 25:58]. Putting ones trust in Allaah is one of the greatest and most important ways of getting rid of pessimism and superstition and other matters pertaining to shirk. (b) Knowing that everything that happens, happens by the decree of Allaah. Blessings and calamities alike are covered by the will and decree of Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (al-lawh al-mahfooz), before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allaah. [al-Hadeed 57:22]. Thus a person may be reassured about these matters, and there is no need for tatayyur or tiyarah, because good and bad alike are subject to the will and decree of Allaah. (c) Istikhaarah. This is one of the greatest forms of worship and is complete tawakkul or dependence on Allaah. It is the alternative to tatayyur and tiyarah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to teach his Companions to make istikhaarah for all their affairs just as he used to teach them the soorahs of the Quraan. (d) Moving away from places which one thinks are unlucky. Here we are talking about doubt, not certainty. Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: A man said, O Messenger of Allaah, we lived in a house where our number was great and our wealth was abundant, then we moved to a house where our numbers dwindled and our wealth decreased. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Leave it, for it is bad. (Reported by Maalik, Abu Dawood, al-Bukhaari in al-Adab al-Mufrad, and classed as hasan by al-Albaani). Leave it, for it is bad Ibn Abd al-Barr said: I think that he said it lest they adhere to thoughts of tiyarah. Al-Baghawi said: He told them to move away from it because they did not like it and did not feel comfortable; if they moved, the things they were feeling would go away. He did not tell them to move because the house was the cause of the problems. But the Creator made that the time for His decree to be carried out. suggested by Ibn al-Arabi al-Maaliki. (e) Fal (good omen). This is the opposite of tiyarah, for example when a man who is sick hears another addressing him as Ya saalim (O healthy one)!. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no adwaa (contagion) and no tiyarah, but I like righteous fal, a good word. (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). The difference between fal and tiyarah is that fal involves thinking in positive terms about Allaah, whereas tiyarah involves the opposite, so for this reason it is disliked. There is another issue here: if a person puts his trust in Allaah and goes ahead with his plans, then disaster strikes and harm befalls him, how can this happen when he thought of Allaah in positive terms? Our answer is that this is a test, not an omen or tiyarah; the believer is tested in accordance with the level of his faith. Haafiz al-Hakami said: One of the conditions of fal is that it is not something that a person relies on or tries to figure out; it is just a coincidence that happens to a person without him thinking about it. It is a particularly loathsome form of bidah to try to find fal in the Quraan [by opening it at random]. The one who takes the Verses of Allaah as a joke or idle entertainment is surely doing wrong. If a person tries to figure out fal and use it to get good luck, this is tiyarah, like using arrows to seek luck or a decision. O Allaah, we seek refuge with You from associating anything knowingly with You, and we seek Your forgiveness for that which we do unknowingly. References: Al-Qawl al-Mufeed ala Kitaab al-Tawheed .

      "Praise be to Allah.The first wife’s distress when her husband marries another wife is to be expected, and Allaah has set out rules and regulations to reduce these feelings or remove them altogether, by enjoining justice, patience in the face of adversity, and so on. Whatever the case, the fact that these feelings of distress and the dislike of polygamy exist does not justify condemnation of polygamy. Islam came to serve and increase people’s best interests, and to reduce harmful things and render them ineffective. There is no doubt that polygamy, when practised properly in accordance with Islam, achieves many things that are in people’s best interests (such as maintaining the chastity of the man who is not satisfied with one wife, taking care of and maintaining the chastity of the woman who has no husband, increasing the offspring of the Muslims, solving the problem of widows and spinsters, and of the reduced numbers of men after times of war, and so on). As regards the bad things that happen in cases of polygamy, either they are very small when compared to its benefits, or they stem from bad application of this practice. One of the rights which Islam gives to women is that a wife should have her own house, so the two wives do not have to live together under one roof. And Allaah knows best.\n",

(Reported by Muslim, 738). But if some words from the Quraan are recited as duaa, such as (interpretation of the meaning): Our Lord! Give us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and save us from the torment of the Fire! [al-Baqarah 2:201], then there is nothing wrong with this.

      "Praise be to Allah.and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger. It is a duty on man to be kind to his parents, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): be good and dutiful to your parents [al-Anaam 6:151]; to show gratitude to them in all kinds of ways, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): give thanks to Me and to your parents [Luqmaan 31:14]; and to show them all kinds of good treatment, because of the command of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to treat them kindly. The ways in which one can show them kindness and respect are many, e.g., visiting them, speaking kindly to them, lowering to them the wing of humility, giving them gifts, and so on. When you go to visit them with the hope of earning reward from Allaah, this is a great form of worship. A son should not neglect this type of worship, and he should appreciate the joy that his parents feel when they see their son and spend time with him. He should not let his work keep him away from seeing his parents, because it is very important and precious for them to see their son. If a person is aware of some negative things when he visits them, he can reduce these negative aspects, or cut the visit short and make up for it in other ways, such as sending letters, making telephone calls or others ways of keeping in touch and maintaining ties, like giving gifts, and so on.

      "Praise be to Allah.As far as a person’s sleeping after praying Fajr is concerned, no text (of Qur’aan or hadeeth) has been reported to indicate that this is prohibited, so the general principle applies (i.e., everything is permitted except that which has been expressly forbidden). But the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions after praying Fajr was to remain sitting in the place where they had prayed until the sun rose, as is reported in Saheeh Muslim (1/463) in the hadeeth of Sammaak ibn Harb, who said: “I asked Jaabir ibn Samurah, ‘Did you used to sit with the Messenger of Allaah?’ He said, ‘Yes, frequently. He would not get up from the place where he had prayed Subh until the sun rose. When the sun rose, he would get up. They used to talk about things that had happened during the Jaahiliyyah, and they would laugh and smile.’” Also, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked his Lord to bless his ummah in the mornings, as is reported in the hadeeth of Sakhr al-Ghaamidi, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O Allaah, bless my ummah in the mornings.’ Whenever he sent out troops or an army, he would send them at the beginning of the day.’” Sakhr was a trader, and he used to send out his caravans at the beginning of the day, and he did well as a result and made money.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah, with an isnaad in which there is some jahaalah (i.e., one narrator is unknown); corroborating evidence is to be found in a hadeeth narrated by ‘Ali, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn Mas’ood and others, may Allaah be pleased with them all.) For this reason some of the salaf disliked the idea of sleeping after Fajr. Ibn Abi Shaybah reported in his Musannaf (5/222, no. 25442) with a saheeh isnaad from ‘Urwah ibn al-Zubayr that he said: “Al-Zubayr used to forbid his children to sleep in the morning.” ‘Urwah said: “I do not hear of any man who sleeps in the morning, but I lose interest in that person.” In summary then, people should make the most of this time which can bring many benefits in this world and in the Hereafter, but if a person sleeps at this time to gain strength to do his work, there is nothing wrong with this, especially if it is not easy for him to sleep at any other time of the day. Ibn Abi Shaybah reported in his Musannaf (5/223, no. 25454) from the hadeeth of Abu Yazeed al-Madeeni who said: “Umar came to Suhayb one morning and found him sleeping, so he sat down until he woke up. Suhayb said: ‘The Ameer al-Mu’mineen is sitting in his place and Suhayb is sleeping!’ ‘Umar said to him: ‘I did not like to disturb your sleep that could be beneficial for you.’” As for sleeping after ‘Asr, this is also permitted; there is no saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to indicate that sleeping at this time is prohibited. As for the words, “Whoever sleeps after ‘Asr and loses his mind as a result has no-one to blame but himself,” which are attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), this is a false hadeeth and there is no proof that these words were uttered by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).

None of the people noticed or mentioned any change in his life or in his dealing with them, his salaah and adhkaar, or his teachings. The effect of that witchcraft had to do with his initmate relationship with his wives, or with some of his wives, and it was reported only by ‘Aa’ishah, who mentioned that he would imagine that he had had intercourse with his wives when in fact he had not. This effect did not have any impact upon the Message; it happened by the will and decree of Allaah, for a reason.

      "Praise be to Allah.There are conditions attached to making ijtihaad. Not every individual has the right to issue fatwas and make pronouncements on matters, unless he has knowledge and is qualified. He has to be able to know the daleel; the wording and apparent meaning of the texts; what is saheeh (sound) and what is da’eef (weak); al-naasikh wa’l-mansookh (what abrogates what); wording and interpretation of texts; what is specific in application and what is general; what is stated in brief and what is mentioned in detail. This needs lengthy experience and practice, knowledge of the various branches of fiqh and where to look for information; knowledge of the opinions of the ‘ulamaa’ and fuqahaa’, and memorization or knowledge of the texts. Undoubtedly issuing fatwas without being qualified to do so is a grave sin, and means that one is speaking without knowledge. Allaah has warned us against that, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): “And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: “This is lawful and this is forbidden,” so as to invent lies against Allaah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allaah will never prosper.” [al-Nahl 16:116]. In a hadeeth: “Whoever was given a fatwaa with no proof, his sin will go back on the one who gave him the fatwaa.” (Saheeh; narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 2/321). The seeker of knowledge should not hasten to issue fatwas or to speak on an issue until he has found the source and daleel for what he is saying, and who has spoken about it previously. If he is not qualified to deal with the matter, he should pass it on to someone who is better able to deal with it, and he should limit himself to that which he knows, and continue learning and studying until he is qualified to make ijtihaad.

      "Praise be to Allah.It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The deceased is punished by the weeping of his family for him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1286). This was explained as meaning, when a person had told his family to do that, as was done during the Jaahiliyyah. And it was said that it meant, if their custom was to weep and wail and he did not warn them. And it was said that it meant, he would feel hurt and saddened because they were doing something that would not help them at all; it does not refer to the punishment of the Fire. But simply mentioning the person, feeling grief and saying “Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon (to Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return)” – these actions are not included in this prohibition, because these feelings are something that overwhelm a person, and he cannot help thinking of the deceased, mentioning him, grieving for him and feeling sorrow because of his loss.

      "Praise be to Allah.When performing ghusl because of janaabah (impurity, e.g. after intercourse), both men and women must wash their heads and ensure that the water reaches the roots of the hair; it is not sufficient merely to wipe the head. A woman who wears her hair in braids is excused from having to undo her braids when doing ghusl because of janaabah, due to the difficulty involved in doing them up again. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, I am a woman who wears her hair in braids. Do I have to undo my braids when I make ghusl because of janaabah?’ He said, ‘No, it is enough if you pour water on your head three times, and then over the rest of your body. That will make you clean.’” (Reported by Muslim, no. 497). But in the case of a woman who has ended her period or nifaas (post-natal bleeding), she has to undo her braids when she does ghusl.

However, after the prayer he has to do wudoo’ for the next prayer if something comes out after the first prayer, and he has to clean his clothes for the next prayer. He should try to wear a pad to absorb what comes out, so that it does not contaminate his clothes.

      "Praise be to Allah.It should be noted that one of the main reasons that cause problems between spouses, and that could cause these problems to escalate to a very bad level is a lack of knowledge of the rights which each partner has over the other. Islam states these rights clearly, and urges and obliges each partner to fulfil them, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And they (women) have rights (over their husbands) similar (to those of their husbands) over them, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [al-Baqarah 2:228]. This aayah indicates that for every right that one partner has, there is a corresponding duty which the other partner must fulfil; thus balance will be achieved in all aspects of the relationship, which will strengthen the stability of family life. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said concerning this aayah: It is their (womens) right to good companionship and proper treatment on the part of their husbands, and their duty to obey and do what their husbands tell them to do. Ibn Zayd said: Fear Allaah with regard to them (wives) just as they should fear Allaah with regard to you. Al-Qurtubi said: This aayah covers all the rights and duties within marriage. One of those rights is that trivial mistakes should be overlooked, especially words and deeds by which no harm was intended. Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Every son of Adam makes mistakes, and the best of those who make mistakes are those who repent. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2501; Saheeh al-Jaami, 4/171). Both husband and wife have to be patient and put up with one another, because everyone makes mistakes, and the one with whom you have to be most patient is the one with whom you live and interacts with most. Neither party should resort to tit-for-tat reactions. If one spouse sees that the other is very angry, he or she should restrain his or her own anger, and not respond immediately. For this reason Abul-Darda said to his wife: If you see me angry, calm me down, and if I see you angry, I will calm you down, otherwise it will be too difficult to live together. The imaam of Ahl al-Sunnah, Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) married Abbaasah bint al-Mufaddal, the mother of his son Saalih, and he used to say of her: Umm Saalih lived with me for twenty years, and we never argued over the slightest thing. One of the most important rights/duties is that each spouse should advise and remind the other to obey Allaah. It is reported in a saheeh hadeeth that a group of the Sahaabah asked the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Teach us which kind of wealth is best, so that we may try to acquire it? He said: The best is a remembering tongue (one that remembers Allaah), a grateful heart and a believing wife who helps ones faith. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/278; al-Tirmidhi, 3039; Saheeh al-Jaami, 5231). A man should not make his wife angry if he sees in her something that he dislikes, because if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will like another, so he should balance the two. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No believing man should hate a believing woman: if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will like another. (Reported by Muslim, 36). Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Woman was created from a rib, and if you try to straighten a rib you will break it, so deal with her gently. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/8; Ibn Hibbaan, 1308; Saheeh al-Jaami, 2/163). One of the best ways to ensure a good atmosphere between husband and wife is a good attitude, hence Islam placed an important emphasis on this matter. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the ultimate in good treatment of others and good attitude. Abul-Darda reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no good deed that will be put in the balance that will weight heavier than a good attitude. The one who has a good attitude will reach, because of it, the level of those who fast and pray. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2003; Abu Dawood, 4799). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The most perfect of the believers in faith are the best in attitude, and the best of you are those who are best to their womenfolk. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1/217; Ahmad, 2/250; Al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 284). Some of the ways in which one can treat ones wife well are to turn a blind eye and not to pick on things, great or small, and not to rebuke or scold for every single incident, except in the case of duties towards Allaah. This is how Allaah guides us in the Quraan, when He says (interpretation of the meaning): and live with them (women) honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good. [al-Nisa 4:19]. If a woman disobeys her husband and refuses to obey him, he has the right to discipline her as prescribed by shareeah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they (spend) to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allaah and their husbands) and guard in the husbands absence what Allaah orders them to guard (e.g., their chastity, their husbands property, etc.). As to those women on whose part you see ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next) refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). Surely, Allaah is Ever Most High, Most Great. [al-Nisa 4:34]. This aayah indicates that the husband has the right to discipline his wife when she disobeys his orders or rebels against him, and that this discipline takes a step-by-step approach which may reach the level of hitting, within certain conditions. Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Know that Allaah does not command hitting in His Book in clear terms except in this passage and with regard to the prescribed punishments (hudood), so disobedience to husbands is equated with major sins, and Allaah has given the task (of disciplining) to husbands, instead of leaders, and without the need for judges, witnesses or evidence, because Allaah has entrusted wives to their husbands. Ill-conduct (nushooz) here refers to disobedience, i.e., those on whose part you fear disobedience and rejection of Allaahs command to obey their husbands. Allaah has made this discipline in stages, as follows: Admonition without forsaking them (refusing to share their beds) or hitting them. So the woman is reminded of her duty to be a good companion and treat her husband properly. If gentle admonition and kindly reminders do not work, then the discipline is taken to the second stage: Forsaking, by turning his back on her in bed or sleeping in a separate bed. But he should not go to extremes in this by keeping away for more than four months, which is the period set by Allaah for the one that swears not to approach his wife. This forsaking should only be for the purposes of disciplining and correcting, not for taking revenge or punishing. Hitting in a manner that is not painful, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): beat them (lightly, if it is useful),. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Forsake her in her bed, and if she mends her ways (this is good), but if not, then Allaah has given permission for you to hit her in a way that is not painful. The husband must be careful to ensure that his hitting is for the purpose of discipline and warning, and not for any other purpose, so he must make sure that he hits as lightly as possible, by prodding with the fist and so on. Ata said: I said to Ibn Abbaas: What is the hitting that is not painful? He said, The siwaak (tooth-stick) and so on. (i.e., hitting with the siwaak). The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, advising his ummah: Fear Allaah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allaah and they are lawful to you by the word of Allaah. Your rights over them are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, so if they do that then hit them in a way that is not painful. (Saheeh hadeeth). The husband should avoid hitting parts of the body that are sensitive, such as the head and stomach, and the face, because the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade hitting the face in general. Muaawiyah ibn Haydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said, O Messenger of Allaah, what are the rights of the wife of any one of us over us? He said, That you feed her as you feed yourself and clothe her as you clothe yourself, and that you do not say May Allaah make your face ugly or hit her i.e., in the face. (Reported by Abu Dawood, 2/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4/446). If she desists, and stops rebelling, then he is not allowed to keep punishing her or to accuse her of saying or doing anything, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). With regard to your particular situation, we do not know all the details or the reason why you hit your wife or why she and her daughter attacked you. But we do understand that you are the one who started it, you started by hitting her then you made her angry by laughing at her, which is when the mistake on her part and that of her daughter occurred. What we advise you to do is to let your wife come back to you and go back to living together in one home. You should advise your wife to admit that she has made a mistake, and explain to her the seriousness what she has done by disobeying you, hitting you back and encouraging her daughter to misbehave towards you as you mentioned. This girl must understand that she is a guest in the home of her mothers husband and she has to respect the one who has given her refuge in his home. If her presence is making things more complicated and causing more problems, then you must come to some agreement with them for the girl to move to her own home. Seek the help of Allaah, have patience and treat your wife well. We ask Allaah to help you all and create love between your hearts. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.A Muslim is permitted to marry a woman of the People of the Book, Jewish or Christian, so long as she is chaste and modest, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): (Lawful for you in marriage) are chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time [al-Maaidah 5:5]. But this is not recommended, especially for a Muslim who is living in a kaafir country under their laws and legislation. It is not permissible for a Muslim woman under any circumstances to marry a non-believer (kaafir), whether he is of the People of the Book or otherwise, chaste or not, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): they [believing women] are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them [al-Mumtahinah 60:10] Todays Christians, so long as they claim to belong to, revere and follow Jesus (Eesaa), are among the People of the Book, and the rulings concerning the People of the Book that are recorded in the Quraan and Sunnah apply to them, but at the same time we regard them as kaafirs who have gone astray. Even if a Muslim son marries a non-Muslim woman, his parents are still not permitted to disinherit him so long as he is still a Muslim and has not committed any offence which would put him beyond the pale of Islam.

      "Praise be to Allah.The answer is in two parts: In general terms, every believer must believe that every action of Allaah has great wisdom behind it, and there is no need for it to be explained in full to every person. This is a kind of test, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… that He may test you which of you is best in deed…” [al-Mulk 67:2] To answer this question in more detail: the Qur’aan was revealed in the language of the Arabs, and in Arabic it is as correct to use the plural when speaking of one person as it is to use the singular. But the plural is used for respect and glorification, and no one is more deserving of respect and glorification than Allaah. So the singular is used to affirm the fact that He is One and has no partner or associate, and the plural is used to affirm His glory and majesty, may He be exalted. Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) wrote in Majmaoo’ al-Fataawaa (5/128) some words which may be of interest to us here: “With regard to Allaah’s closeness to us, sometimes it is mentioned in the singular, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad) concerning Me, then (answer them) I am indeed near (to them by My knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me…’ [al-Baqarah 2:186] and the hadeeth: ‘The One on Whom you call is closer to any one of you than the neck of his riding-camel’, and sometimes in the plural, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… And We are nearer to him than his jugular vein’ [Qaaf 50:16]. This is like the aayaat (interpretation of the meanings): ‘We recite to you…’ [al-Qasas 28:3] and ‘We relate unto you…’ [Yoosuf 12:3]. Such usage in Arabic refers to the one who is great and has helpers who obey him; when his helpers do something by his command, he says ‘We did it,’ as a king might say, ‘We conquered this land and we defeated this army,’ and so on.” Further important details may be found under question # 606 .

Your wife has no right to her mothers share of her grandfathers estate, because your mother-in-law died before her father. She thus had no share in her fathers estate because one of the conditions of inheritance is that the heir should be alive after the death of the person from whom he or she is to inherit. This condition is not met in this case, therefore your wife has nothing except her share of her own mothers estate. The grandfathers estate should be divided among his own heirs, so his children, for example (your wifes maternal uncles and aunts), will be given their shares according to Islamic law, which is two shares for males and one share for females. If the grandfather left a wife behind when he died, she should be given one-eighth of the estate, and so on. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Allaah is Able to do all things, and if you pray to Him sincerely, he will answer your du'aa'. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And when My slaves ask you concerning Me, then I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicants when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.\" [al-Baqarah 2:186] Among the evidence that du'aa' may have the benefit of eliminating problematic characteristics is the hadeeth of Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: \"Abu Salamah came to me one day after being with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: 'I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) something that made me very happy. He said, \"There is no calamity that befalls one of the Muslims and he responds by saying 'Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilahi raaji'oon (Truly, to Allaah we belong, and truly, to Him we shall return),' then he says, 'Allaahumma ujurni fi museebati w'ukhluf li khayran minha (O Allaah, reward me in this calamity and compensate me with something better than it),' but Allaah will do that for him.\"'\" Umm Salamah said: \"I learnt this from him, and when Abu Salamah died, I said, 'Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilahi raaji'oon,' then , 'Allaahumma ujurni fi museebati w'ukhluf li khayran minha,' Then I thought to myself, Where could I find anyone better than Abu Salamah? When my 'iddah (waiting-period) was over, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked permission to see me, whilst I was busy dyeing a hide. I washed the qaraz (a kind of dye derived from a certain plant) from my hands and granted him permission, putting out for him a leather cushion stuffed with palm fibres. He sat down on it, and asked for my hand in marriage. When he had finished what he had to say, I said: 'O Messenger of Allaah, I do not want you to lose interest in me, but I am a very jealous woman, and I am afraid that you may see in me something that could earn me the punishment of Allaah. I am also a woman who is ageing, and I have children.' He said, 'As for the jealousy you mentioned, Allaah will take this away from you (according to another report: as for you saying that you are a jealous woman, I will pray to Allaah to take away your jealousy). As for what you say about age, the same applies to me as to you. As for your children, your children are my children.' So I accepted his offer and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me. Allaah gave me someone even better than Abu Salamah, namely the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\" These two reports are in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad. The hadeeth was also reported by Muslim from Umm Salamah, who said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'There is no Muslim who suffers a calamity and says what Allaah has commanded: \"Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raji'oon, Allaahumma ujurni fi museebati w'ukhluf li khayran minha,\" but Allaah will compensate him with something better.' When Abu Salamah died, I said, 'Who among the Muslims could be better than Abu Salamah, the first household to migrate to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?' Then I said [this du'aa'] and Allaah compensated me with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He sent Haatib ibn Abi Balta'ah on his behalf to ask for my hand in marriage, but I said, 'I have a daughter, and I am a jealous woman.' He said, 'As for your daughter, we will pray to Allaah to make her independent, and I will pray to Allaah to take away your jealousy.'\" (Reported by Muslim, 1525). I want to tell you, my brother, that the sincere person whose du'aa's are answered has to be completely honest with Allaah in the way he strives to rid himself of bad characteristics and to acquire good characteristics. If you want proof of this, it is to be found in the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \"Whoever seeks to be patient, Allaah will give him patience.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1376). He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: \"Knowledge comes by learning and patience comes by making oneself be patient.\" (Reported by al-Daraqutni and others; classed as hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami', 2328). Allaah has created the means of getting results, so you must pay attention to the laws of Allaah that govern His creation. Use the means of acquiring good characteristics and avoiding bad characteristics so that you may get the results you want. You must strive hard and call on Allaah. Allaah will not betray the hopes of His slaves or cause their hard work and efforts to be lost or wasted.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allaah. Zinaa (fornication or adultery) is a crime that is forbidden by divine laws and rejected by all wise and sane people, even if they are not Muslim. Allaah has condemned those who do this in many aayaat of the Qur’aan and in numerous ahaadeeth of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He has threatened those who do this with severe punishment and disgrace in this world and the next – except those who repent, have faith and do righteous deeds, for Allaah will accept their repentance. The gate of repentance is open, but it is a condition of repentance that one should regret the deed and give it up. Islam wipes out whatever came before. With regard to the child, he belongs to his mother, and should not be named after his father. This is the ruling concerning the illegitimate child: he should not be named after his father because he was conceived in fornication, not in wedlock. It is obligatory to take care of this child and bring him up with Islamic manners and morals. Because this immoral act has occurred, you must repent from it, but you should cover it up and not disclose it; you do not have to tell the people the truth. If the child wants to know the truth, you can tell him in an appropriate manner, and let him know that what happened was in the days of kufr (before you became Muslim), and that when a person repents and becomes Muslim, this wipes out whatever happened before. The child does not bear any responsibility for what happened, and as long as his mother has become Muslim, there is no grounds for rebuking or punishing her. It is obligatory to accept the will and decree of Allaah, and if this child does righteous deeds he will enter Paradise. No soul is made to bear the burdens of another. We ask Allaah to keep you safe and sound and to forgive you. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Contents Related Homosexuality in Malaysia Punishment for homosexuality Is homosexuality a sin? Praise be to Allah.Homosexuality in Malaysia We do not have any information about homosexuality in Malaysia, but we assume that the Muslims there feel total abhorrence towards this shameful act, because their religion, Islam, emphatically forbids this deed and prescribes a severe punishment for it, in this world and the next. How could it be otherwise, when the Prophet of Islam (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: \"Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lut (Lot), kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done\" - i.e. if it is done with consent. (This hadith was narrated by al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 1376) Punishment for homosexuality The scholars of Islam, such as Malik, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad and Ishaq said that (the person guilty of this crime ) should be stoned, whether he is married or unmarried. Is homosexuality a sin? There is no doubt that homosexuality , which goes against the pure human nature created by Allah, by making men content with men and women with women, destroying families, adversely affecting the birth rate, causing the spread of killer diseases, harming the innocent when children are raped, and generally spreading corruption on earth, should be uprooted and stamped out. Perhaps your research will lead you to find out much more about this religion with its great laws and accurate rules and the wisdom of the One Who revealed it.

      "Praise be to Allah.The scholars have differed as to how one should go down in sujood, whether one should go hands first or knees first. According to the Hanafis, Shaafais and one opinion narrated from Ahmad, the person who is praying should go down on his knees first, then on his hands. Al-Tirmidhi thought that this was the opinion of the majority of scholars, and said in his Sunan (2/57): This is how it is done according to the majority of scholars: they think that a man should go down on his knees before he puts his hands down, and when he gets up he should raise his hands before his knees. Those who express this opinion take as evidence the hadeeth of Waail ibn Hajar, who said: I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), when he did sujood, putting his knees down before his hands, and when he got up he raised his hands before his knees. (Reported by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaai, Ibn Maajah and al-Daaraqutni (1/345). He said: The only one who narrated it was Yazeed ibn Haaroon from Shurayk. Nobody reported from Aasim ibn Kulayb except Shurayk, and Shurayk is not qawiy (strong). Al-Bayhaqi said in al-Sunan (2/101): its isnaad is daeef (weak). Al-Albaani classed it as daeef in al-Mishkaat (898) and al-Irwa (2/75). Other scholars classed it as saheeh, such as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Zaad al-Maaad). Among those who thought that one should go down into sujood knees first were Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and his student Ibn al-Qayyim; contemporary scholars who favour this view include Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz and Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen. Maalik, al-Awzaai and the scholars of hadeeth thought that one should go into sujood hands first, based on the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, When any one of you prostrates, let him not go down as the camel does; let him put his hands down before his knees. (Reported by Ahmad (2/381), Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, and al-Nisaai. Al-Nawawi said in al-Majmoo (3/421): it was reported by Abu Dawood and al-Nisaai with a jayyid isnaad. It was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in al-Irwa (2/78), who said: This is a saheeh isnaad, all of whose men are thiqaat, the men of Muslim, apart from Muhammad ibn Abd-Allaah ibn al-Hasan, also known as al-Nafs al-Zakiyyah al-Alawi, who is thiqah) Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah made a valuable comment on this matter in al-Fataawa (22/449): Praying in both ways is permissible, according to the consensus of the scholars. If a person wants to go down knees first or hands first, his prayer is valid in either case, according to the consensus of the scholars, but they disputed as to which is preferable. The scholar should act upon whichever opinion he believes is more likely to be correct, and the ordinary Muslim should follow the opinion of a scholar whom he trusts. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. The Quran was revealed by Allah, may He be glorified, as a law and a reference as to what is permissible and prohibited, what is commanded and forbidden, for people to follow, so that they obey its commands and abide by its prohibitions, take what it allows as permissible and take what it prohibits as forbidden. The Quran tells us about what happened before and what is yet to come, and it is a reference for judging between us. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… We have neglected nothing in the Book…” [6:38]. After the Revelation was completed, Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): “… This day, I have perfected your religion for you…” [5:3]. The Sunnah [words and deeds of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] came to explain and complement the Quran. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “I have been given the Quran and something like it with it.” The phrase “something like it with it” refers to the Sunnah. (saheeh/authentic hadeeth). Allah commanded us to refer to these two constitutional references, when He said (interpretation of the meaning): “…if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger…” [4:59].

      "Praise be to Allah.First of all, it is essential to understand that guidance to the true religion of Islam and belief in the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the message he brought comes about only by the help of Allaah, and that we are required to explain this and produce evidence of it. There is a great deal of clear evidence for the one who seeks to find out the truth about the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), including the following: Allaah chose him even though he had grown up as an orphan and was illiterate, knowing neither how to read or write. All good qualities and virtues were perfected in him, to the point of ultimate perfection. All these good qualities were combined and firmly established in him, something which no one else can attain except the Prophets whom Allaah protected and guided. This combination of perfect qualities is one of the greatest proofs of the truth of his Prophethood (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The revelation of Allaah was bestowed upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Angel of Revelation, Jibreel (Gabriel), who is recognized by all the People of the Book [Jews and Christians], came to him, and when he received revelation, there were unusual effects on him that indicated the intensity of the effort involved in receiving the Message of Allaah from Jibreel, upon whom be peace. His Companions witnessed this when he received Revelation, and they believed that the revelation was something that came from an outside source and was beyond his control; it came to him from (Allaah), the Wise and Praiseworthy. Allaah supported the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with physical miracles, with which he challenged his people. Among the most important of these were the splitting of the moon and the Night Journey to Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). They were unable to match these miracles, and so they were a decisive, divine testimony to the truth of his Prophethood (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah supported him with miracles and evidence for people of reason and understanding, the greatest of which was the Qur’aan. This was the greatest sign, which contains in its pages miracles of both style and content, which all of mankind cannot match or imitate, even if they gather together for that purpose. This is clear from the statements of the most eloquent of the Arabs, who were completely unable to match it. The Qur’aan was – and centuries later still is, praise be to Allaah – an eternal miracle as is evident in its brilliant style, its information about the Unseen, its fulfilment of the promises of Allaah, the superiority of its laws, and the fact that its rulings are appropriate for every time and place – in addition to the fact that it has such a moving impact on people’s hearts. The Qur’aan refers to the signs and proofs surrounding the person of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which testify to his truthfulness. For example, he was free of sin and trivial spitefulness; he grew up illiterate in the Arabian Peninsula, and did not receive any religious knowledge from beyond its borders, nor did he spend time acquiring any religious knowledge. When he reached the age of forty, he brought divine knowledge that none of the earlier or later generations could produce. He also received special protection and care from Allaah, which kept him safe at times of crisis; if it were not for this protection he would most certainly have been doomed to destruction. None of this could have happened except to one who was truly sent from Allaah. His coming was foretold in the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel (Gospel), and some of the People of the Book saw that these prophecies applied in totality to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), which led them to embrace Islam. There are still passages in the Bible, in both the Old and New Testaments, in the versions that are accepted by the People of the Book, that clearly refer to the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – for example in the Gospel of Barnabas, which is considered by Christians to be the most authentic Gospel. The Message of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not unique to him, but was in nature and content similar to the message brought by other Messengers before him. Allaah had sent Prophets and Messengers, such as Moosa (Moses), ‘Eesa (Jesus) and others, to the Children of Israel, and great numbers had believed in them and borne witness to the truth of their Books, which were similar in general terms to the message brought by the Qur’aan. This was eloquent testimony to the truth of the Message with which he was sent, especially as it belonged to the same type of Message to whose truth they had testified. When Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with the same Message as the Prophets who had come before him, the Qur’aan came to confirm their Books and their Prophethood, and to call people to believe in them. So when the People of the Book disbelieved in him and his Book, it meant that they were disbelieving in their own Books and Messengers. As the Qur’aan contained the same principles as their books, and confirmed them, this meant that it was the least likely to be fabricated or to have come from a source other than Allaah, because all of them came from Allaah, may He be exalted. In summary, then, the proof of truthfulness is quite clear in this case. The evidence is there both in (historical) reports and on the grounds of common sense. This will cure the ill (i.e., the one who has doubts) and quench the thirst (of the one who longs for knowledge), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Indeed, there has come to you from Allaah a Light (prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) and a plain Book (the Qur’aan), wherewith Allaah guides all those who seek His Good Pleasure to ways of peace, and He brings them out of darkness by His Will unto light, and guides them to a Straight Way” [al-Maa’idah 5:15-16]. In order to provide the Christian mentioned in the question with proof and evidence, it should be sufficient to give him a translation of the meanings of the Qur’aan. If he believes, then praise be to Allaah, and if he turns away, then destroy not yourself in sorrow for him (cf. Faatir 35:8). Allaah leaves astray whom He will and guides whom He will, and He is the Most Knowing of Guides.\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.This subject is one of the topics which is being researched by the Islamic Fiqh Council (Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami), which has issued the following fatwaa: It is permitted to transplant or graft an organ from one part of a person’s body to another, so long as one is careful to ascertain that the benefits of this operation outweigh any harm that may result from it, and on the condition that this is done to replace something that has been lost, or to restore its appearance or regular function, or to correct some fault or disfigurement which is causing physical or psychological distress. It is permitted to transplant an organ from one person’s body to another, if it is an organ that can regenerate itself, like skin or blood, on the condition that the donor is mature and understands what he is doing, and that all other pertinent shar’i conditions are met. It is permitted to use part of an organ that has been removed because of illness to benefit another person, such as using the cornea of an eye removed because of illness. It is haraam to take an organ on which life depends, such as taking a heart from a living person to transplant into another person. It is haraam to take an organ from a living person when doing so could impair an essential vital function, even though his life itself may not be under threat, such as removing the corneas of both eyes. However, removing organs which will lead to only partial impairment is a matter which is still under scholarly discussion. It is permitted to transplant an organ from a dead person to a living person whose life depends on receiving that organ, or whose vital functions are otherwise impaired, on the condition that permission is given either by the person before his death or by his heirs, or by the leader of the Muslims in cases where the dead person’s identity is unknown or he has no heirs. Care should be taken to ensure that there is proper agreement to the transplant of organs in the cases described above, on the condition that no buying or selling of organs is involved. It is not permitted to trade in human organs under any circumstances. But the question of whether the beneficiary may spend money to obtain an organ he needs, or to show his appreciation, is a matter which is still under scholarly debate. Anything other than the scenarios described above is still subject to scholarly debate, and requires further detailed research in the light of medical research and shar’i rulings.

      "Contents Related Virtues of fasting What are the White Days? Praise be to Allah.First of all, congratulations on the blessing of Allah which you have received, as He has guided you to this religion and caused you to enjoy the sweetness of obedience and worship through fasting, which is one of the greatest forms of worship. Here we will explain in brief the virtues of fasting. Virtues of fasting The virtues of fasting are immense, and a number of sound hadiths state this, such as the following: Fasting is something which is just for Allah, and Allah will give multiple rewards without measure for it. The hadith says: [Allah says:] Fasting is Mine and it is I Who give reward for it. (Al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 1904) There is nothing equivalent to fasting. (Al-Nasai, 4/165; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/413) The supplication (du’a) of the fasting person will not be refused. (Reported by al-Bayhaqi, 3/345; see also al-Silsilah al-Sahihah, 1797) The one who fasts has two joys: the joy of breaking his fast and, when he meets his Lord, the joy of having fasted. (Reported by Muslim, 2/807) Fasting will be an intercession for the slave on the Day of Resurrection, when it will say: O Lord, I stopped him from eating and drinking during the day, so let me intercede for him. (Reported by Ahmad, 2/174; al-Bayhaqi classed its isnad as hasan in al-Mujtama, 3/181; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/411) The smell (coming from the mouth of) the fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the scent of musk. (Muslim, 2/808). Fasting is a protection and a strong fortress against the Fire. (Reported by Ahmad, 2/402; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/411 and Sahih al-Jami’, 3880) Whoever fasts one day for the sake of Allah, Allah will keep his face seventy years distance away from the Fire because of it. (Reported by Muslim, 2/808) Whoever fasts a day seeking the pleasure of Allah and then dies [i.e. that is the last thing he does] will enter Paradise. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/391; see also Sahih al-Targhib, 1/412) In Paradise, there is a gate called al-Rayyan, through which those who fast will enter, and no-one else will enter through it. After they have entered, it will be locked and no-one else will enter it. (Al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 1797). Voluntary fasts will make up for any shortfall in obligatory fasts. Examples of voluntary fasts include ‘Ashura , the Day of ‘Arafah , al-Ayam al-Bid (the White Days), Mondays and Thursdays , six days of Shawwal , and increased fasting during the months of al-Muharram and Sha’ban. What are the White Days? What is meant by al-Ayyam al-Bid is the 13th, 14th, and 15th of each lunar month, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage.” [al-Baqarah 2:189] So the timing of certain acts of worship and the ‘iddah (waiting period for women who have been divorced or widowed, etc.) are worked out according to the lunar months of the Hijri or Islamic calendar, not the solar months of the Gregorian or Western calendar. The fasts which you have observed according to the solar calendar most likely do not correspond with the lunar calendar, but in any case you will be rewarded, in sha Allah, for the days that you have fasted, because you have fasted them voluntarily for the sake of Allah. But if you wish to earn the reward that is specifically for fasting Ayyam al-Bid, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do, you should find out the timings according to the lunar calendar and fast according to it. We ask Allah to increase His blessings upon you, to help you adhere to His religion, to give you the strength to do that which will please Him and to increase your reward, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. Do not forget us in your prayers whilst you are fasting. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

There should be an offer or proposal (ijab) from the wali or the person who is acting in his place, who should say to the groom “I marry so-and-so to you” or similar words. There should be an expression of acceptance (qabul) on the part of the groom or whoever is acting in his place, who should say, “I accept,” or similar words. Conditions of marriage in Islam The conditions of a proper marriage contract are as follows: Both the bride and groom should be clearly identified, whether by stating their names or describing them, etc. Both the bride and groom should be pleased with one another, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No previously-married woman (widow or divorcee) may be married until she has been asked about her wishes (i.e., she should state clearly her wishes), and no virgin should be married until her permission has been asked (i.e., until she has agreed either in words or by remaining silent).” They asked, “O Messenger of Allah, how is her permission given (because she will feel very shy)?” He said: “By her silence.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4741) The one who does the contract on the woman’s behalf should be her wali, as Allah addressed the walis with regard to marriage (interpretation of the meaning): “And marry those among you who are single…” [al-Nur 24:32] and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Any woman who marries without the permission of her wali, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1021 and others; it is a sound hadith) The marriage contract must be witnessed , as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There is no marriage contract except with a wali and two witnesses.” (Reported by al-Tabarani; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 7558) Conditions of the wali The conditions of the wali are as follows: He should be of sound mind He should be an adult He should be free (not a slave) He should be of the same religion as the bride. A non-Muslim cannot be the wali of a Muslim , male or female, and a Muslim cannot be the wali of a kafir, male or female, but a non-Muslim can be the wali of a non-Muslim woman for marriage purposes, even if they are of different religions. An apostate (one who has left Islam) cannot be a wali for anybody. He should be of good character (‘adalah – includes piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), as opposed to being corrupt. This is a condition laid down by some scholars, although some of them regard the outward appearance of good character as being sufficient, and some say that it is enough if he is judged as being able to pay proper attention to the interests of the woman for whom he is acting as wali in the matter of her marriage. He should be male, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No woman may conduct the marriage contract of another woman, and no woman can conduct the marriage contract on behalf of her own self, because the zaniyah (fornicatress, adulteress) is the one who arranges things on her own behalf.” (Reported by Ibn Majah, 1782; see also Sahih al-Jami’, 7298) He should be wise and mature, which means being able to understand matters of compatibility and the interests of marriage. Order of who can take the role of the wali The jurists put possible walis in a certain order, and a wali who is more closely-related should not be ignored unless there is no such person or the relatives do not meet the specified conditions. A woman’s wali is her father, then whoever her father may have appointed before his death, then her paternal grandfather or great-grandfather, then her son, then his sons or grandsons, then her brother through both parents (full brother), then her brother through her father, then the sons of her brother through both parents, then the sons of her brother through her father, then her uncle (her father’s brother through both parents), then her father’s brother through the father, then the sons of her father’s brother though both parents, then the sons of her father’s brother through the father, then whoever is more closely related, and so on – as is the case with inheritance. The Muslim leader (or his deputy, such as a judge) is the wali for any woman who does not have a wali of her own. And Allah knows best.\n",

This is according to the more sound opinion among the scholars. But if the bank is involved in this transaction as the supplier or lender of funds, which you then have to repay with some extra, then this is clearly an interest-based transaction, which is undoubtedly haraam. It may be almost impossible to avoid interest-based transactions when dealing with real estate in many countries, and one may hardly be able to find any halaal alternative, but the Muslim must bear this with patience and seek out halaal means. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (of every difficulty). And He will provide for him from (sources) he could never imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allaah will accomplish his purpose.

But problems of the worst type occur when people become fanatically devoted to one particular imam or madhhab, to the extent that they reject the truth or ignore other sound evidence because of this. Allaah warns against rejecting the word of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): And let those who oppose the Messengers commandment (i.e., his Sunnah) (among the sects) beware, lest some fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.

In response to your question, if the marriage was contracted through an offer or proposal (eejaab) from the walee (guardian) of the bride and acceptance (qabool) on the part of the groom, with the consent of the bride, in front of two Muslim witnesses of good character (as regards piety, attitude, conduct, etc.), then the marriage contract is valid. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “A marriage is not properly contracted unless there are two Muslim witnesses, regardless of whether the bride and groom are both Muslims or only the groom is. This is what Ahmad stated, and it is also the opinion of al-Shaafi’i.” (Al-Mughni, 9/349; al-Mufaddal fi Ahkaam al-Mar’ah, 6/120). If the marriage was conducted as described above, then it is valid, otherwise it must be repeated. It is permissible for a non-Muslim woman to be married by her non-Muslim guardian, but if she becomes Muslim, this role can only be played by a Muslim. If she has no Muslim walee, then this role can be delegated to the director of the Islamic Centre or whoever is acting in his stead.

The Islamic Fiqh Council has researched the matter of dealing in bonds and issued the following statement: Bonds which represent a commitment to pay the face value plus interest, or conditional benefits, are haraam according to sharee’ah, whether one is buying, selling or handling them, because they are considered to be interest-based loans. This applies whether they are issued by private companies or by public bodies run by the state. The fact that they are forbidden is not affected by giving them other names such as “certificates”, “investment documents” or “savings”, or calling the interest “profit”, “commission” or “returns”. Also forbidden are bonds that offer prizes, because these are loans made on the condition that the benefits or increase will go to the group loaning the money, or to one of them, who is not specified at the time of investment, in addition to the fact that this is based on the idea of gambling.

Rulings governing the giving of medication differ according to the circumstances and people involved: §It is obligatory in cases where not giving medication could cause death, disability or the loss of a limb, or where the sickness is bound to spread if not treated, as in contagious diseases. §It is encouraged in cases where not giving medication may weaken a person physically, and it is not as bad as the cases mentioned above. §It is allowed in cases which are not covered in the two preceding categories. §It is discouraged in cases where the treatment could lead to complications that are worse than the original complaint. (2)Treatment of cases where there is no hope of recovery (a)The Muslim believes that disease and cure are matters that are under the control of Allaah, may He be glorified. Treatment and medication are ways of utilizing the laws of cause and effect that Allaah has incorporated into the running of the universe. It is not permitted to despair of the mercy of Allaah – there should always be the hope of healing by the permission of Allaah. The doctors and families should try to raise the morale of those who are sick and continue their efforts to relieve the mental and physical suffering of the patient regardless of whether a cure is expected or not. (b)A situation may be deemed hopeless in accordance with the doctors’ opinions, the state of medical science in any given time or place, and the circumstances of the patient himself. (3)The patient’s permission (a)The patient’s permission depends on whether he is qualified to give it (i.e., he should be of sound mind, mature and responsible). If this is not the case, then the permission of his guardian should be sought, within the limits set by sharee’ah which requires a guardian to take care of a person’s interests and protect him from harm, and provided that no attention is paid to the guardian’s refusal to give permission if this is obviously going to harm the person. In this case, guardianship has to be transferred to another guardian, or to the Muslim leader. (b) The Muslim leader has the right to force medication in certain situations, such as a case of contagious disease, or the giving of vaccines or inoculations. (c)In an emergency where lives are at stake, treatment does not depend on obtaining permission. (d)When carrying out medical research, there must be total agreement on the part of suitably qualified subjects, with no element of compulsion (such as using prisoners for research) or financial compulsion (such as using the poor), and no harm must result from this research.

      "Praise be to Allah.Sales and purchases made at auctions are valid transactions, so long as the conditions stipulated by sharee’ah are adhered to. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, and one of the texts which they quote as evidence is the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sold a rug (for spreading on the ground or putting on the back of a riding-beast) and a cup. He said, “Who will buy this rug and cup?” A man said, “I’ll take them for a dirham,” and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Who will offer more than a dirham? Who will offer more than a dirham?” Another man gave him two dirhams, and bought the goods. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, may Allaah have mercy on, in al-Sunan, 1139; he said, “This is a hasan hadeeth which we know only from the hadeeth of al-Akhdar ibn ‘Ajlaan…) The practical conclusion drawn from this by the scholars is that they see nothing wrong with selling war-booty or inherited goods to the highest bidder. This hadeeth was narrated by al-Mu’tamir ibn Sulaymaan and by more than one of the prominent people from al-Akhdar ibn ‘Ajlaan. There follows a definition of this kind of sale, and some of the regulations that apply to it: The contract: an auction is a commutative contract or exchange, based on a call issued vocally or in writing to invite interested parties to take part in the auction. The contract is concluded when the seller is satisfied. The actual contract may vary according to whether it is the matter of selling or leasing, etc, and according to the nature of the auction – it may be voluntary, like the regular kind of auction held among individuals, or required by law, such as auctions ordered by a judge. Auctions required by law may be held by public and private institutions, and government bodies, as well as individuals. Any procedures involved in the auction – such as paperwork, regulations and administrative and legal conditions – should not contradict the rules of Islamic sharee’ah. Requiring a deposit from everyone who wants to come in is permissible according to sharee’ah, but it should be returned to anyone who does not buy anything, and should be counted as part of the purchase price for those who do buy. According to sharee’ah, there is nothing wrong with charging an entry fee to cover the costs of producing booklets listing regulations, etc., so long as it is not more than the actual cost. Artificially inflating prices is haraam. This may take the following forms: a person who has no intention of buying may inflate the price to tempt the buyer to offer more a person who has no intention of buying may pretend to like the product and to know a lot about it, and may praise it highly, to tempt the buyer to offer more the vendor, his agent or the auctioneer may make false claims about how much was paid for the product, in order to mislead the one who is thinking of buying modern forms of this forbidden inflation of prices include the use of audio-visual and written means to list fine qualities that do not exist in reality, or to raise the price so as to tempt the buyer and impel him to complete the transaction And Allaah knows best.\n",

This includes situations where it is obvious that the matter should not be disclosed, such as when a man looks around to make sure that there is nobody listening to what he is saying, and so on, as well as private and embarrassing matters that no-one would like everyone to know about. A secret is a trust for which the person who has been asked to keep it is responsible. This is in accordance with both the teachings of Islam and the requirements of chivalry and good manners. In general, secrets should not be disclosed and spreading secrets without a good reason is considered to be subject to the disapproval of sharee’ah. The duty to keep secrets applies even more to people working in professions where disclosure of secrets could reflect badly on the profession itself, as is the case in the medical profession, where people come to practitioners to seek advice and ask for help, and so they have to tell them everything that may help them to do their job properly, including matters which they may not disclose to anyone else, even their closest family members. The obligation to keep secrets does not apply in cases where concealing something may lead to a greater harm that outweighs any harm feared as a result of revealing it. Such situations are of two types: Cases where a secret has to be revealed on the grounds of choosing the lesser of two evils in order to avoid greater harm, and allowing harm to befall an individual for the sake of the general good.

This is a major crime, because it entails the deliberate murder of innocent souls for financial gain. This is a serious form of wrongdoing and the rulings concerning it are well known and obvious. The question of whether the aborted foetus may be used as a source of transplant organs has been researched by the Islamic Fiqh Council, which issued the following fatwaa: It is not permitted to exploit foetuses as a source of organs needed for transplant into another person except in certain limited circumstances under stringent conditions. It is not permitted to deliberately induce abortion for the purpose of exploiting the foetus for organ transplants to another person. Only foetuses expelled through natural or spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) or aborted for a legitimate reason may be used in this way. Surgery should not be performed to remove the foetus except in cases where the mother’s life is at risk. If the aborted foetus is viable and capable of living, then medical attention should be aimed at preserving its life, not at exploiting it for organ transplant. If it is not viable and will not live, its organs cannot be used until after it has died naturally, according to the conditions of sharee’ah. It is not permissible to exploit any part of the procedures required to obtain and transplant organs for commercial gain.

And he [Shaytaan] said: ‘I will take an appointed portion of Your slaves; Verily, I will mislead them, and surely, I will arouse in them false desires; and certainly, I will order them to slit the ears of cattle, and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah.’ And whoever takes Shaytaan as a wali (protector or helper) instead of Allaah, has surely suffered a manifest loss.” [Al-Nisa’ 4:116-119] In al-Saheeh, it was reported that Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Allaah has cursed the women who do tattoos and those who have this done, the women who pluck eyebrows and those who have this done, and the women who file their teeth and change the creation of Allaah.” Then he said: “Should I not curse those whom the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed, when it says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it, and whatever he forbids you, abstain (from it)…’ [al-Hashr 59:7]”\n",

If he washes everything twice, or once, this is sufficient.

The fact that the kaafirs will be singled out for hardship on the Day of Resurrection indicates that it will be easy for the believers. The words (interpretation of the meaning), “Truly, that Day will be a hard Day, far from easy for the disbelievers.” [al-Muddaththir 74:9-10] also indicate that it will be easy, not difficult, for the believers. This is also indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Hastening towards the caller, the disbelievers will say, ‘This is a hard Day.’” [al-Qamar 54:8]. This means that the Day of Resurrection will be long for the kuffaar and short for the Muslims. Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, has mentioned in His Book the length of time the reckoning will take on the Day of Resurrection. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Those who have earned the Garden [Paradise] on that day will be better in their home and happier in their place of noonday rest” [al-Furqaan 25:24 – Pickthall’s translation]. This aayah indicates that the reckoning will be completed in half a day, because al-maqeel (translated as “noonday rest”) refers to a siesta or rest from the heat of mid-day. Among those who said that the reckoning will be completed in half a day are Ibn ‘Abbaas, Ibn Mas’ood, ‘Ikrimah and Ibn Jubayr, because this is what is indicated by this aayah, as was reported by Ibn Katheer and others. (Daf’ Ayhaam al-Idtiraab by al-Shanqeeti, p. 172). Another clear indication that the reckoning of the believer on the Day of Resurrection will be easy is the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “For the believers, the (length of) the Day of Resurrection will be like the time between Zuhr and ‘Asr.” (Reported by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 8193).

Some of them say that he is definitely a kaafir who has gone beyond the pale of Islam. He is considered to be a murtadd (apostate) who is to be given three days to repent – if he does not, he is to be executed for his apostasy. The funeral prayer will not be recited over him, and he will not be buried in the Muslim graveyard. The greeting of salaam is not to be given to him, in life or in death, and his greeting is not to be returned; prayers for forgiveness and mercy for him cannot be offered; he cannot inherit, neither can his wealth be inherited, instead it is to be given to the Muslim treasury (bayt al-maal). This ruling applies whether the number of people who are neglecting their prayers are many or a few. This opinion is the soundest and most correct, because of the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “The difference between us and them is salaah. Whoever neglects it is a kaafir.” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and the authors of Sunan with a saheeh isnaad); and: “(Nothing stands) between a man and kufr and shirk, except prayer: (whoever neglects it becomes a kaafir and a mushrik).” (Reported by Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh, with other similar ahaadeeth). The majority of scholars said that if a person denies that prayer is obligatory, he is a kaafir and an apostate from the religion of Islam. The ruling concerning such a person is as described above. If he does not deny that it is obligatory, but he neglects it because of laziness, for example, then he is guilty of a major sin (kabeerah), but he is not considered to be beyond the pale of Islam. He should be given three days in which to repent. If he does, then al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allaah); if he does not, then he should be executed, but this is a punishment, not because he became a kaafir. In this case, he should be washed (ghusl, after death) and wrapped in a shroud (kafn). The funeral prayer should be offered for him, prayers can be offered for forgiveness and mercy for him, and he should be buried in the Muslim graveyard. He can inherit and be inherited from. In general, all the rules concerning Muslims who are sinners apply to him, in life and in death.\n",

When you pray Zuhr, its time is until ‘Asr comes. When you pray ‘Asr, its time is until the sun becomes yellow. When you pray Maghrib, its time is until the reddish glow disappears.

It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates anything in this matter of ours [Islam] that is not part of it will have it rejected.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). Al-‘Arbaad ibn Saariyah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) preached to us in a beautiful and moving manner, which made us weep. We said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, it is as if this is a farewell, so give us some advice.’ He said, ‘I advise you to fear Allaah and to hear and obey, even if an Ethiopian slave is appointed over you. Those of you who live will see a lot of differences arise, so I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the sunnah of the rightly guided Khulafa’ (al-Khulafa’ al-Raashideen), and to seize it firmly. Beware of newly-innovated things, for every innovation is a going-astray.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, who said, it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. ) And we should remember the hadeeth of Abu ‘Umayr ibn Anas from his uncles among the Ansaar. He said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was concerned about how to call the people together to pray. Someone suggested raising a flag when the time for prayer came, so that when they saw it they could call one another, but he did not like this idea. Someone mentioned a ram’s horn, like the shofar, but he did not like this idea, and said, “That belongs to the Jews.” A bell was suggested, but he said, “That belongs to the Christians.” ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd ibn ‘Abd Rabbihi went away, thinking about this matter that was of concern to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Then he saw the Adhaan in a dream, and he came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the next day and told him about it. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “O Bilaal, go and see what ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Zayd wants you to do, then do it.” So Bilaal called the Adhaan. Reported by Abu Dawood, 420; this is a saheeh hadeeth. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) rejected the ram’s horn and the bell, so how can the Muslims accept the drum?

Verily, the Mushrikûn (polytheists) are Najasun (impure). So let them not come near Al-Masjid Al-Harâm (at Makkah) after this year” [al-Tawbah 9:28]. With regard to other mosques, some fuqaha’ said that it is permissible because there is nothing to indicate that it is not allowed; others said that it is not permissible, by analogy with al-Masjid al-Haraam. The correct view is that it is permissible if it serves the interests of sharee’ah or meet a valid need, such as a person hearing something that may invite him to enter Islam, or because he needs to drink water in the mosque, or the like. This is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) tied up (his prisoner) Thamaamah ibn Athaal al-Hanafi in the mosque before he became Muslim, and the delegations of Thaqeef and the Christians of Najraan stayed in the mosque before they became Muslim. There were many benefits offered by doing this: they could hear the speeches and sermons of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), see people praying and reciting Qur’aan, and other benefits that are gained by those who visit the mosque. (From Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 6/276). If some kuffaar ask to enter the mosque so that they can see how Muslims pray, so long as they have nothing with them that could make the mosque dirty, and there are no women among them who are dressed in a provocative fashion, or any other reason not to let them in, then there is nothing wrong with allowing them to enter and sit behind the Muslims so they can see how they pray.

Among the evidence that it is permissible to turn the places of worship of shirk and kufr into mosques is the following hadeeth: From Talq ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): “We went out as a delegation to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). We gave bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to him and prayed with him. We told him that in our land we had a place of worship [the word used indicates a Jewish or Christian place of worship], and we asked him to give us some of the water left over from his wudoo’, so he called for water and did wudoo’ and rinsed out his mouth, then he poured that water into a vessel and told us, ‘Go, and when you reach your land, knock down that place of worship and sprinkle this water over the place, then use that place as a mosque.’ We said, ‘Our land is far away and the heat is intense, the water will dry up.’ He said, ‘Add more water to it, it will only increase it in goodness.’ So we set out and when we reached our land, we knocked down our place of worship, sprinkled water on the place and used it as a mosque. We called the adhaan there, and when the monk, a man from Tayyi’, heard it, he said, ‘The call of truth!’ then he climbed one of our hills and we never saw him again.” (Reported by al-Nasaa’i, 694). And Allah knows best. The building itself does not need to be destroyed so long as its roof, walls etc. can be put to use and architectural alterations can be made, after removing all the symbols of Shirk and other forbidden things, so that the structure of the building will match the rows of prayer, facing the direction of the Ka’bah.

On this basis, the fuqaha’ stated that in certain situations, women are permitted to uncover their faces in front of non-mahram men when it is necessary to do so, and it is permitted for those men to look at them, provided that this do not go beyond the bounds of what is necessary, because what is permitted on the grounds of necessity should not be exaggerated. These special situations may be summed up as follows: I – Proposal of marriage It is permitted for a woman to uncover her face and hands in front of a man who wants to propose to her, so that he may see them, without being alone with her and without touching her, because the face gives an indication of ugliness or beauty, and the hands give an indication of whether the body is slender or plump (which in turn gives an impression about fertility). Abu’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: “The scholars do not differ as to the permissibility of looking at the face… the focal point of beauty, the place one looks at…” Many ahaadeeth indicate that it is permissible for a man to look at the woman to whom he is proposing marriage. Among them are the following: Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “A woman came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, I came to give myself to you in marriage.’ So the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) looked at her, he raised his gaze and stared at her, then he lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had not made any decision, she sat down. Then a man from among his Companions stood up and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, if you don’t want to marry her, then marry her to me.’ …” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 7/19; Muslim, 4/143; al-Nisaa’i bi Sharh al-Suyooti, 6/113; al-Bayhaqi, 7/84). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I was with the Prophet , and a man came to him and told him that he had married a woman of the Ansaar. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘Have you looked at her?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go and look at her, for there is something in the eyes of the Ansaar.’” (Reported by Ahmad, 2/286, 299; Muslim, 4/142; al-Nisaa’i, 2/73). Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When any one of you proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, let him do so.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Haakim.

It was also reported by Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, and by Ahmad and al-Bazzaar from the hadeeth of Abu Humayd. Fath al-Baari, 9/181). Al-Zayla’i said: “It is not permissible for him to touch her face or hands – even if he feels that no desire will be aroused by doing so – because it is haraam and there is no need to do so.” In Durar al-Bihaar it says: “It is not permissible for the qaadi, the witnesses or the groom to touch her, even if they feel that no desire will be aroused by doing so, because there is no need for that.” (Radd al-Muhtaar ‘ala’l-Durr al-Mukhtaar, 5/237). Ibn Qudaamah said: “It is not permitted for him to be alone with her because she is still forbidden for him, and only a look is permitted, therefore being alone with her remains haraam, because there is no guarantee that he will not do something haraam if he is alone with her. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man is alone with a [non-mahram] woman but the Shaytaan is the third one present with them.” He should not look at her in a lustful or suspicious manner. Ahmad said, according to a report narrated by Saalih: “He should look at the face, and he should not look in a lustful manner.” The man may look at her repeatedly, checking her features, because the desired aim cannot be achieved in any other way.” II – Business dealings It is permitted for a woman to uncover her face and hands when buying or selling, and it is permitted for the vendor to see her face when he hands over the goods and asks for the money, provided that this will not lead to fitnah – otherwise it is forbidden. Ibn Qudaamah said: “If a person deals with a woman when selling or renting, he may look at her face so he knows who she is, and may go back to her when the money is due (a guarantee of the price when the deal is finalized). It was reported that Ahmad said this was makrooh in the case of a young woman, but not in the case of an old woman, and in the case where there is fear of fitnah, or where there is no need for this business deal. But in cases where it is necessary, and there is no wrongful desire, then there is no harm in it.” (al-Mughni, 7/459; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/348 bi Haamish al-Mughni; al-Hidaayah ma’a Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 10/24). Al-Dasooqi said: “ When testimony is given concerning a woman who wears niqaab (face-veil), she has to remove her niqaab. This applies in the case of marriage and other matters, such as selling, giving gifts, debts, power of attorney, and so on. This is the opinion favoured by our shaykh.” (Haashiyat al-Dasooqi ‘ala’l-Sharh al-Kabeer, 4/194). III – Medical treatment A woman is permitted to uncover the site of her illness whether it is on her face or elsewhere on her body, for a male doctor to treat her, on the condition that her husband or mahram is present, and if she cannot find a female doctor. It is less serious for her to be seen by a doctor of the same sex, and she should not be seen by a non-Muslim doctor if a Muslim doctor is available. Also, she should not uncover more than the site of the problem. It is not permissible for the doctor to look at or touch more than is necessary, because the issue is one of necessity and should not be exaggerated. Ibn Qudaamah said: “it is permissible for the doctor to look at whatever is necessary of her body, of her private parts and elsewhere, because there is a need for it to be uncovered. It was reported that a boy who had stolen something was brought to ‘Uthmaan. He said, ‘Look at his groin (to see if he had pubic hair, which would indicate whether he had reached the age of puberty [and would therefore be considered to be a responsible adult] or not).’ They did not find any pubic hair, so they did not cut off his hand.” (Al-Mughni, 7/459; Ghidha’ al-Albaab, 1/97). Ibn ‘Aabideen said: “He said in al-Jawharah: if the illness is in any part of her body apart from her private part, it is permitted (for the doctor) to look at it in order to treat it, because it is the matter of necessity. If the sickness is in her private part, he (the doctor) should teach a woman how to treat it. If there is nobody who can do that, and they fear that she may die or suffer unbearably, then they should cover all of her body except the site of the sickness, then a man may treat her, but he should avoid looking at her as much as he can, and look only at the site of the sickness that he is treating.” (Radd al-Muhtaar, 5/237. See also, al-Hidaayah al-‘Alaa’iyah, p. 245). A similar ruling applies to one who is taking care of a sick person, even if it is someone of the opposite sex, when helping the patient with wudoo’ or istinja’ (washing the private parts after using the toilet). (See Ghidha’ al-Albaab, 1/97). Muhammad Fu’aad said: “What indicates that it is permissible for a man to treat a woman – within the restrictions mentioned above – is the report narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari with his isnaad from al-Rabee’ bint Mu’awwadh, who said: “We used to go out on military campaigns with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). We would bring water to the people and serve them, and bring the dead and wounded back to Madeenah.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/80, 10/136. Fath al-Baari. A similar report was narrated from Anas by Muslim, 5/196; Abu Dawood, 7/205 ma’a ‘Awn al-Ma’bood; and al-Tirmidhi, 5/301-302, who said this is hasan saheeh) Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth under the chapter heading Baab hal yudaawi’l-rajul ul-mar’ah wa’l-mar’at ul-rajul? (Chapter: can a man treat a woman or a woman a man?). (Fath al-Baari, 10/136). Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: “The ruling that a man may treat a woman was derived from this by analogy; he (al-Bukhaari) did not confirm that, because it is possible that this referred to the time before hijaab was made obligatory, or that women used to take care of their husbands or mahrams on military campaigns. The ruling is that it is permissible for women to treat non-mahram men in cases of necessity, with as little looking and touching as possible.” (Fath al-Baari, 10/136) IV – Testimony It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face when she is giving testimony in court, whether she is a witness in a case or is there to witness a deal, and it is permissible for the qaadi (judge) to look at her in order to know who she is and to protect the rights of all concerned. Shaykh al-Dardeer said: “It is not permitted to give testimony against a woman in niqaab until she uncovers her face so that it may be known who she is and what she looks like.” (Al-Sharh al-Kabeer li’l- Shaykh al-Dardeer, 4/194) Ibn Qudaamah said: “The witness may look at the face of the woman against whom he is testifying so that his testimony will speak about her in specific terms. Ahmad said: ‘He cannot testify against a woman unless he knows who she is.’” (Al-Mughni, 7/459; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/348, bi haamish al-Mughni; al-Hidaayah ma’a Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 10/26). V – In court cases It is permissible for a woman to uncover her face in front of a qaadi (judge) who is to rule either in her favour or against her, and in this situation he may look at her face in order to know who she is and for the sake of protecting people’s rights. The same rules that apply to giving testimony or bearing witness also apply in court cases, because they serve the same purpose. (See Al-Durar al-Mukhtaar, 5/237; Al-Hadiyah al-‘Alaa’iyah, p. 244; Al-Hadiyah ma’a Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 10/26). VI – In front of mature boys who feel no physical desire It is permissible – according to one of the two reports – for a woman to show in front of a mature boy who feels no physical desire what she shows in front of her mahrams, because he has no interest in women, and it is permissible for him to see all that. Shaykh Abu’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: “The mature boy who feels no physical desire may see parts of a woman’s body above the navel and below the knee, according to one of the two reports, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): ‘… there is no sin on you or on them to move about, - attending (helping) you each other…’ [al-Noor 24:58] and ‘And when the children among you come to puberty, then let them (also) ask for permission, as those senior to them (in age)…’ [al-Noor 24:59]. This indicates that there is a differentiation between those who have reached puberty and those who have not.” Abu ‘Abd-Allaah said: “Abu Tayyibah did cupping for the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was a boy.” It was also reported that he said: “He is like the ajnabi (stranger, i.e., non-mahram), because he is like one who has reached puberty in the matter of physical desires, and this means that hijaab is required and it is forbidden to look. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… small children who have no sense of the shame of sex…’ [al-Noor 24:31]. As for small boys who are not mature, it is not necessary to cover in front of them at all.” (Al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/349. See also Al-Mughni, 7/458 and Ghada’ al-Albaab, 1/97). VII – The man who has no desire It is permissible for a woman to show in front of a man who has no desire what she can show in front of her mahrams, because he has no interest in women, and he is allowed to see all of that. Ibn Qudaamah said: “Whoever no longer feels any desire, because of old age, impotence or incurable illness, or because he is a eunuch, … or a mukhannath (the effeminate man or a man who has female hormones) who feels no desire, the ruling that applies to such a man is the same as the ruling that applies to mahrams regarding looking at women, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… or old male servants who lack vigour…’ [al-Noor 24:31], i.e., those who feel no desire for women.” Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “This is the one of whom women do not feel shy.” He also said: “This is the mukhannath who is impotent (i.e., cannot have an erection).” It was reported that Mujaahid and Qutaadah said: “This is the one who has no interest in women, but if he is a mukhannath who feels desire and knows about women, then the rules that apply to others apply also to him, because ‘Aa’ishah said: ‘A mukhannath entered upon the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they used to think that he was a man who felt no physical desires, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon us when this man was describing a woman and saying ‘When she comes in, she comes on four, and when she goes out, she goes on eight.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Do I not see that this man knows who is here? This one should never enter upon you.’ And he was kept away after that.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and others). Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “The mukhannath is not only the one who is known to be promiscuous. The mukhannath is the one who looks so much like a woman physically that he resembles women in his softness, speech, appearance, accent and thinking. If he is like this, he would have no desire for women and he would not notice anything about them. This is one of those who have no interest in women who were permitted to enter upon women. Do you not see that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not prevent that mukhannath from entering upon his wives at first, but when he heard him describing the daughter of Ghaylaan and realized that he knew about women, he commanded that he should be kept away.” (Al-Mughni, 7/463; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/347-348). IX – Old women who are past marriageable age Old women who are past marriageable age may uncover their faces and what usually appears in front of non-mahram men, but it is still better for them to remain covered. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect wedlock, it is no sin on them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show their adornment. But to refrain (i.e., not to discard their outer clothing) is better for them…” [al-Noor 24:60]. Ibn Qudaamah said: “In the case of old women who are past marriageable age, there is nothing wrong if they show what ordinarily appears, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning), ‘And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect wedlock…’ [al-Noor 24:60].” Ibn ‘Abbaas said concerning the aayahs (interpretation of the meanings), “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze…” [al-Noor 24:30] and “Tell the believing women to lower their gaze…” [al-Noor 24:31]: “Old women who no longer expect to get married were exempted from this. The same exemption also applied to women who are deformed and are not desirable.” (Al-Mughni, 7/463; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/347-348). X – Uncovering the face in front of kaafir women The scholars have differed concerning how a Muslim woman should appear in front of kaafir women. Ibn Qudaamah said: “The ruling concerning women dealing with women is the same as that concerning men dealing with men. There is no difference between Muslims, and no difference between a Muslim woman and a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) woman, just as there is no difference between two Muslim men or between a Muslim man and a dhimmi man when it comes to seeing. Ahmad said: ‘Some people think that she should not take off her head covering in front of a Jewish or Christian woman. However, I think that she (a Jewish or Christian woman) should not see the private part (of a Muslim woman), or attend her when she gives birth (i.e., she should not be her midwife, because she will look at the most private part of her body when she gives birth – except in cases of necessity, as discussed above).’” Another opinion was reported from Ahmad, according to which a Muslim woman should not remove her niqaab in front of a dhimmi woman, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… or their women …” [al-Noor 24:31]. But the first opinion is more correct, because kaafir women, Jewish and others, used to enter upon the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and they did not wear hijaab in front of them nor were they commanded to do so. ‘Aa’ishah said that a Jewish woman used to come and talk to her, saying “May Allaah save you from the punishment of the grave,” and she [‘Aa’ishah] asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)… Asma’ said, “My mother came to me, and she had no desire to become Muslim. I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), ‘Should I uphold the ties of kinship with her?’ and he said, ‘Yes.’” Moreover, hijaab between men and women serves a purpose that is not an issue in the case of a Muslim woman and a dhimmi woman, just as it is not an issue in the case of a Muslim man and a dhimmi man. Hijaab is obligatory when there is a text stating that it is so or the obligation may be understood by analogy; in the case of a Muslim woman and a non-Muslim woman, there is neither text nor analogy. The aayah “… or their women …” [al-Noor 24:31] could refer to all women. (Al-Mughni, 7/464; al-Sharh al-Kabeer ‘ala Matan al-Muqni’, 7/351 bi haamish al-Mughni). Ibn al-‘Arabi al-Maaliki said: “The correct view, in my opinion, is that this permissible in the case of all women, and that it appears with the pronoun ( -hinna = their) to match the rest of the aayah. This is the aayah of pronouns, where the pronoun -hinna appears twenty-five times; there is nothing else like it in the Qur’aan. So this word matches the others.” (Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 3/326). Al-Aloosi said: “Al-Fakhr al-Raazi suggested that the dhimmi woman is like the Muslim woman, and he said: “The correct opinion is that she (the dhimmi woman) is like the Muslim woman, and ‘their women’ means all women. The opinion of the salaf (early generations of Islam) should be understood on the basis that (covering in front of non-Muslim women) is preferable, but it is not obligatory.” Then he said: “This view is easier for people today, for Muslim woman can hardly observe hijaab in front of dhimmi women.” (Tafseer al-Aloosi, 19/143). Muhammad Fu’aad said: “If this opinion was easier in their time, then no doubt it is more appropriate and easier in our own time, especially for those women who, because of circumstances beyond their control, find that they have to live in non-Muslim countries, where they mix with non-Muslim women and their lives are interwoven with theirs, to the extent that observing hijaab in front of them is fraught with difficulties. Truly, to Allaah we belong, and truly, to Him we shall return.” XI – Hajj and ‘Umrah Women must uncover their faces and hands when they enter ihraam for Hajj or ‘Umrah. At this time, they are forbidden to wear niqaab and gloves, because the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The woman who is in ihraam must not wear niqaab or gloves.” If a woman needs to cover her face because men are passing close by her, or she is beautiful and is sure that men are looking at her, she should drop a part of head covering over her face, because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah in which she said, “Riders were passing by us, and we were in ihraam with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so when they came near, each of us would lower her jilbaab over her face, and when they went away we would uncover our faces again.” Al-Juzayri said, reporting from them: “A woman may cover her face for a necessary reason, such as non-mahram men passing close by her, and the fact that (the cloth) will touch her face does not matter. This is to make it easy and alleviate hardship.” (Al-Fiqh ‘ala’l-Madhaahib al-Arba’ah, 1/645). These are situations in which it is acceptable for a woman to uncover her face and hands, explained in detail by the fuqaha’ and scholars. But there is one other situation which deserves our attention, and that is when a Muslim woman is forced to uncover her face – what is the ruling in this case? XII – Compulsion Some oppressive regimes have instituted harsh laws which go against the religion of Islam and rebel against Allaah and His Messenger. These laws prevent Muslim women from wearing proper hijaab, and some of them even remove their niqaab by force and subject them to the worst type of oppression and persecution. Women who wear niqaab have been subjected to harassment in certain European countries, where they have been subjected to harm, and Islam and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) have been slandered. Therefore, when a woman is certain that she is likely to be subjected to unbearable harassment, she is permitted to uncover her face. It is better to follow a scholarly opinion which is less correct than to expose herself to trouble at the hands of evil men. If a woman is permitted to uncover her face and hands in the situations described above, which do not involve force or harassment, then surely it is more likely that she is permitted to uncover them when she is faced with a threat to herself and her religion, especially when her niqaab may expose her to tormentors who may pull the hijaab from her head or subject her to worse abuse. In cases of necessity, things that are ordinarily forbidden are permitted, within the limits of what is strictly necessary, as the scholars have stated, but this should not lead one to take the matter of covering the face lightly. Each woman must evaluate the situation in which she is living and learn from her own experience and that of others, so that she will be sure of what is a case of real necessity, as opposed to her own whims and weaknesses. Although women are permitted to uncover their faces and hands in the exceptional situations described above, they are not permitted to wear make-up and visible jewellery if they do so. It is forbidden for them to display these things in front of non-mahram men, according to all the fuqaha’, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and not to show off their adornment…” [al-Noor 24:31], and because there is no need to do so. (Hijaab al-Muslimah bayna Intihaal wa Ta’weel al-Jaahileen, p. 239). We ask Allaah to reform the Muslims. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

If he does deny this, then he is a kaafir according to the consensus of all scholars. If he repents and starts to pray the obligatory prayers and to fast in Ramadaan, and he continues to do so, then he is considered to be a Muslim, and the prayers and fasts that he deliberately failed to do in the past do not have to be made up, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Islam wipes out what came before and repentance wipes out what came before”, and because the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), when they fought the apostates at the time of [Abu Bakr] al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him), they did not tell those who came back to Islam to make up the fasts or prayers, and they [the Sahaabah] are the most knowledgeable of the sharee’ah of Allaah after the Messengers, peace and blessings of Allaah be upon them.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth to which you refer was reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his Saheeh from Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her: You were shown to me twice in a dream. I saw you in a piece of silk (i.e., he saw her image on a piece of silk, or he saw her wearing a silken garment). I was told, This is your wife, so unveil her, and it was you. I said: if this dream is from Allaah then it will come to pass. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 3606). In his commentary on this hadeeth, Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This dream came after his mission had started, and it was a wahy (revelation) that had implications in real life. (Its implication was that he did indeed marry her later on). His words and it was you indicate that he had seen her before and knew what she looked like. (See Fath al-Baari) There is nothing in the hadeeth to indicate that his marriage to Aaishah was as a result of that dream. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked her father for her hand in marriage, and her father Abu Bakr gave her in marriage, in the usual fashion, as is indicated in the following hadeeth: Urwah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked Abu Bakr for Aaishahs hand in marriage, and Abu Bakr said to him: But I am your brother. He said: You are my brother according to the religion and Book of Allaah (i.e., my brother in Islam), and she is permissible for me (to marry). (Bukhaari, 4691). In his commentary Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Ibn Abi Aasim reported via Yahyaa ibn Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Haatib from Aaishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent Khawlah bint Hakeem to Abu Bakr to ask for Aaishahs hand in marriage. Abu Bakr asked her, Is she right for him? Because she is the daughter of my brother. Khawlah went back and mentioned this to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He told her: Go back and tell him: You are my brother in Islam, and your daughter is right for me. She went back to Abu Bakr and told him, and he said: Call the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). So he came and the marriage was performed. The phrase You are my brother according to the religion and Book of Allaah (i.e., my brother in Islam) was referring to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islamic religion) [al-Hujuraat 49:10] and other similar aayaat. The phrase she is permissible for me (to marry) means it is permissible to marry her even though she is the brothers daughter, because the kind of brotherhood that would prevent such a marriage is the brotherhood of descent (same parent) or of radaaah (by being breastfed in infancy by the same woman), not the brotherhood of faith. As regards the woman to whom the Prophets marriage was arranged in heaven, as it were, by Allaah, and not in the customary fashion, this was Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allaah be pleased with her), as is indicated by the hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: Zaynab used to boast (to her co-wives) about how she had got married to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), saying: Your families arranged your marriages but Allaah arranged my marriage from above the seven heavens. (al-Bukhaari, 6870). No other wife except Zaynab was married to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in such a unique fashion; Aaishahs marriage was arranged as described in the reports quoted above. May Allaah reward you with good for your question. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Many people have the habit of ending a recitation from the Quraan with the words Sadaqa Allaahu al-Azeem (Almighty Allaah has spoken the truth), but this has no basis in Islam because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do it, nor was it the custom of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), and it was unknown among the Taabieen (the generation after the Sahaabah). This custom arose in later times because some reciters would say these words, on the basis of the aayah: Say: Allaah has spoken the truth [Aal Imraan 3:95 interpretation of the meaning], and people liked this. But this istihsaan (being liked) should be rejected, because if this was really something good, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the Sahaabah and the Taabieen the salaf or first and best generations of the ummah would not have neglected to do it. The aayah Say: Allaah has spoken the truth (Aal Imraan 3:95 interpretation of the meaning) does not mean that these words should be said at the end of any reading or recitation. If that were the case, He would have said, When you finish reading, say Allaah has spoken the truth, just as He said (interpretation of the meaning): So when you want to recite the Quraan, seek refuge with Allaah from Shaytaan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed one). [al-Nahl 16:98] The aayah which the innovators use to support their practice of saying Sadaqa Allaah after reciting Quraan was actually revealed in the context of confirming what was said about how all food had been lawful to Bani Israeel except what Israeel had made unlawful for himself. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): Say (O Muhammad): Bring here the Tawraat (Torah) and recite it, if you are truthful. Then, after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against Allaah, such shall indeed be the zaalimoon (disbelievers). Say (O Muhammad), Allaah has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibraaheem (Islamic monotheism, i.e., he used to worship Allaah alone), and he was not of al-mushrikeen (polytheists). [Aal Imraan 3:93-95] If this aayah meant that these words should be said after reciting from the Quraan, the first one to know and do this would have been the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Because this is not the case, we know that this is not what was meant. In conclusion, therefore, saying Sadaqa Allaahu al-Azeem after reciting Quraan is an innovation, and the Muslim should not say it. But believing that Allaah has spoken the truth is obligatory, and whoever disbelieves or doubts the truth of what Allaah has said is a kaafir who is outside of the pale of Islam. We seek refuge with Allaah from that. If a person says Allaah has spoken the truth on certain occasions, such as when something He has foretold comes to pass, affirming the truth of what He has said, then this is permissible, because something similar has been reported in the Sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was giving a speech, and al-Hasan and al-Husayn came along, so he came down from the minbar, picked them up and put them in from of him, then he said: Indeed Allaah has spoken the truth: Your wealth and your children are only a trial [al-Taghaabun 64:15 interpretation of the meaning].\n",

But if you know that you will not be able to avoid it, or you believe it is more likely that you will be too weak to avoid it, then you should change to another specialty from now, so that you will be able to practice a profession that will be acceptable to Allaah. Alternatively, if you see that there are impediments to practicing your specialty due to the involvement of forbidden items, you could take the initiative and commitment to finding permissible alternatives, whether natural or synthetic, to the forbidden items.

Some of the issues having to do with medicine need to be contemplated; for example, if a medicine contains alcohol and would intoxicate a person if a large amount was drunk (i.e. of the medicine itself), then it is haraam; otherwise it is not haraam. Similarly there are questions surrounding the impurities that form the ingredients of some medicines: is the structure of the impure substance changed in totality when it is mixed with the other ingredients, or does it remain the same? Surely you are not unaware that there are medicines taken from the urine of pregnant women, or blood, or from body parts removed from humans, such as placentas, to which the rulings concerning dead meat apply. The rulings governing all of these things need to be investigated, and consequently the rulings regarding their sale; the matter needs to be studied both from the point of view of Islamic Sharee'ah and of chemical analysis.

      "Contents Related How to pray Istikharah Commentary on the hadith of istikharah Praise be to Allah.How to pray Istikharah The description of Salat al-Istikharah (istikharah prayer) was reported by Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah al-Salami (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach his Companions to make istikharah in all things, just as he used to teach them surahs from the Quran. He said: If any one of you is concerned about a decision he has to make, then let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer, then say: Allahumma inni astakheeruka bi ‘ilmika wa astaqdiruka bi qudratika wa asaluka min fadlika, fa innaka taqdiru wa la aqdir, wa ta’lamu wa la a’lam, wa anta ‘allam al-ghuyoob. Allahumma fa in kunta ta'lamu hadhal-amra (then the matter should be mentioned by name) khayran li fi ‘ajil amri wa ajilihi (or: fi deeni wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri) faqdurhu li wa yassirhu li thumma barik li fihi. Allahumma wa in kunta ta'lamu annahu sharrun li fi deeni wa ma’ashi wa ‘aqibati amri (or: fi ‘ajili amri wa ajilihi) fasrifni ‘anhu [wasrifhu ‘anni] waqdur li al-khayr haythu kana thumma raddini bihi (O Allah, I seek Your guidance [in making a choice] by virtue of Your knowledge, and I seek ability by virtue of Your power, and I ask You of Your great bounty. You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not. You are the Knower of hidden things. O Allah, if in Your knowledge, this matter (then it should be mentioned by name) is good for me both in this world and in the Hereafter (or: in my religion, my livelihood and my affairs ), then ordain it for me, make it easy for me, and bless it for me. And if in Your knowledge it is bad for me and for my religion, my livelihood and my affairs (or: for me both in this world and the next), then turn me away from it, [and turn it away from me], and ordain for me the good wherever it may be and make me pleased with it. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 6841; similar reports are also recorded by al-Tirmidhi, al-Nasai, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah and Ahmad) Commentary on the hadith of istikharah Ibn Hajr (may Allah have mercy on him) said, commenting on this hadith: “Istikharah is a word which means asking Allah to help one make a choice, meaning choosing the best of two things where one needs to choose one of them. Concerning the phrase The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach us to make istikharah in all things, Ibn Abi Jamrah said: It is a general phrase which refers to something specific. With regard to matters that are wajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (liked or encouraged), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to do them, and with regard to matters that are haram (forbidden) or makrooh (disliked), there is no need for istikharah to decide whether to avoid them. The issue of istikharah is confined to matters that are mubah (allowed), or in mustahabb matters when there is a decision to be made as to which one should be given priority. I say: it refers to both great and small matters, and probably an insignificant issue could form the groundwork for a big issue. The phrase If any one of you is concerned appears in the version narrated by Ibn Mas’ud as: if any one of you wants to do something Let him pray two rak’ahs of non-obligatory prayer. This is mentioned to make it clear that it does not mean Fajr prayer, for example. Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkar: He can pray istikarah after two rak’ahs of regular sunnah prayer done at zhuhr for example, or after two rak’ahs of any nafl prayers whether they are regularly performed or not It seems to be the case that if he made the intention to pray istikharah at the same time as intending to pray that particular prayer, this is fine, but not if he did not have this intention. Ibn Abi Jamrah said: The wisdom behind putting the salat before the du’a is that istikharah is intended to combine the goodness of this world with the goodness of the next. A person needs to knock at the door of the King (Allah), and there is nothing more effective for this than prayer, because it contains glorification and praise of Allah, and expresses one's need for Him at all times. The phrase then let him say would seem to imply that the du’a should be said after finishing the prayer, and the word thumma (then) probably means after reciting all the words of the salat and before saying salam. The phrase O Allah, I seek Your guidance by virtue of Your knowledge is explaining because You know best. Similarly, by virtue of Your power most likely means seeking Your help. I seek ability (astaqdiruka) means I ask You to give me the power or ability (qudrah) to do whatever is being asked for, or it probably means I ask You to decree (tuqaddir) this for me. So it may mean making it easy. I ask You of Your great bounty refers to the fact that Allah gives out of His great generosity, but no one has the right to His blessings. This is the opinion of Ahl al-Sunnah. You have power, I have none. And You know, I know not refers to the fact that power and knowledge belong to Allah alone, and the slave has no share of them except what Allah decrees for him. O Allah, if in Your knowledge this matter, according to one report, he should mention it by name. It is apparent from the context that he should state it, but it is probably sufficient to be thinking of the matter whilst making this du’a. Then ordain it for me means make it happen for me or it may mean make it easy for me. Then turn it away from me, and turn me away from it means so that my heart will no longer feel attached to it after it has been turned away. Make me pleased with it means make me content with it, so that I will never regret asking for it or be sorry that it happened, because I do not know how it will turn out, even if at the time of asking I am pleased with it. The secret is that one’s heart should not be attached to the matter in question, because that will result in a person becoming restless. Being pleased with something means that one’s heart is content with the decree of Allah.” (Summarized from the commentary of al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) on the hadeeth in Saheeh al-Bukhari, Kitab al-Da’wat and Kitab al-Tawheed.)

      "Praise be to Allah.If he has no interest in his present wife, there is nothing wrong with divorcing her and marrying another, but if he and she come to an agreement whereby she may remain his wife for the sake of the children, there is nothing wrong with this either. If he gives her the choice between divorce and giving up her rights to his time and his spending on her, in whole or in part, this is not oppression. Oppression is when he keeps her by force without giving her any of her rights whilst at the same time refusing to give her a divorce. The evidence (daleel) that the situation described above is permissible is to be found in the hadeeth narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), which comments on the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband’s part…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. She said: “This was a woman who was married to a man who did not care for her, so he wanted to divorce her and marry someone else. (According to another report narrated by al-Bukhaari she said: He was a man who saw something he disliked in his wife, so he wanted to divorce her.) She said to him: ‘Keep me, do not divorce me. Marry someone else and I will absolve you of your obligation to spend on me and share your time with me.’ This is what Allaah referred to when He revealed the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making peace is better…’ [al-Nisaa’ 4:128].” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4807) “This was a woman who was married to a man who did not care for her” means that he did not love her or want to treat her well or stay with her. “I will absolve you of your obligation towards me” means: leave me without divorcing me. Concerning this issue, Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): “And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband’s part…” [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. ‘Ali reported that this was revealed concerning a woman who is married to a man and does not want to leave him, so they come to an agreement that he will visit her every three or four days.” Al-Tirmidhi reported via Sammaak from ‘Ikrimah from Ibn ‘Abbaas that he said: “Sawdah was afraid that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would divorce her, so she said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, do not divorce me; give my day to ‘Aa’ishah.’ So he did so. Then this aayah was revealed.” Al-Tirmidhi said: “(This is) hasan ghareeb.” I say: there is corroborating evidence in a hadeeth from ‘Aa’ishah narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, without referring to the revelation of the aayah. (From Fath al-Baari). The hadeeth mentioned by al-Haafiz ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) is in Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2966, where it is reported that Ibn ‘Abbaas said: “Sawdah was afraid that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would divorce her, so she said: ‘Do not divorce me. Keep me and give my day to ‘Aa’ishah.’ So he did so, then Allaah revealed the aayah: ‘… there is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves; and making peace is better…’ [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. So whatever they agreed upon was permissible.” It is as if the last sentence was the comment of Ibn ‘Abbaas. Abu ‘Iesa said: this is a hasan ghareeb hadeeth. Al-Mubaarakpoori said, commenting on this hadeeth: ‘Sawdah was afraid…’ This refers to Sawdah bint Zam’ah ibn Qays al-Qurashiyyah al-‘Aamiriyyah. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her in Makkah after Khadeejah had died, and consummated the marriage there. The scholars agree that he consummated his marriage to her before he consummated his marriage to ‘Aa’ishah, and she migrated to Madeenah with him. She died at the end of the khilaafah of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab. ‘…was afraid that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would divorce her, so she said…’ Al-Bukhaari and Muslim reported from ‘Aa’ishah that Sawdah bint Zam’ah gave her day to ‘Aa’ishah, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to give ‘Aa’ishah her own day and that of Sawdah. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath: Abu Dawood reported this hadeeth (from ‘Aa’ishah): ‘The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never used to prefer any of us over others in sharing his time (i.e., he was fair in dividing his nights among his wives, and each one of them had her allotted night). When Sawdah bint Zam’ah grew old and feared that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might divorce her, she said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, my day is for ‘Aa’ishah,’ and he accepted this from her. Then concerning this and similar cases, the aayah was revealed (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And if a woman fears cruelty or desertion on her husband’s part…’ [al-Nisaa’ 4:128]. These reports agree that she feared divorce and so gave her day to ‘Aa’ishah. Then al-‘Allaamah al-Mubaraakpoori said: The aayah may be explained thus: ‘If a woman fears’ means if she expects. ‘Cruelty’ means that he spurns her by refusing to sleep with her or by spending less on her than he should, because he dislikes her and wants to marry someone more beautiful. ‘Desertion’ means that he turns his face away from her. ‘There is no sin on them both if they make terms of peace between themselves’ means with regard to the sharing of his time and his spending on her, i.e., he should still give her something in this regard (sharing time or spending) in order to preserve the relationship: if she accepts, this is OK, otherwise the husband must either give her her full rights or divorce her. ‘Making peace is better’ means better than separation, cruelty and desertion. Whatever they agree upon between themselves is permissible. (Tuhfat al-Ahwadi Sharh Jaami’ al-Tirmidhi). And Allaah knows best, May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The relationship of an engaged man with his fiancée is the same as a man’s relationship with any woman to whom he is not related: he is not allowed to enjoy any kind of physical relationship with her whatsoever, until the marriage contract with her has been completed. If it is asked what kind of relationship the husband can have with his wife after the contract has been completed and before the wedding party, the answer is that he may enjoy a full husband-wife relationship, including looking at her, kissing her, being alone with her, travelling with her, having intercourse with her, etc. (al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-iftaa: Fataawa Islamiyyah, 3/154).

      "Related Praise be to Allah.How can your duaa (prayer, supplication) not be answered and not be of benefit to your son, when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has said: There are three duaas which will undoubtedly be answered: the duaa of one who is oppressed, the duaa of a traveller, and the duaa of a parent for his child? (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 3852; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 3033). The word parent [waalid, lit. father] includes both father and mother. You are his mother, who bore him, nursed him, fed him and brought him up. You are more compassionate towards him than all his other relatives, and you are the one who has suffered the most grief and distress because of his loss. Pray for him for forgiveness, mercy, Paradise and salvation from the Fire. Pray for him in your salaat and your sujood (prostration), in the last third of the night and on Fridays before sunset, and at all other times and in all other circumstances. Be of good cheer and remember the great reward which will be yours if you bear this loss with patience, accept the will and decree of Allaah, and hope for reward. You have lost your child to One Who is more compassionate towards him than you, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate, Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds. You also have the consolation of knowing that if you and he die believing in Tawheed and in Islam, you will be reunited after death. The righteous will be reunited with their offspring in Paradise, even if they are of a lesser status than them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, - to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything. Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned. [al-Toor 52:21] As regards your question about what you can do for your father and your son who have passed away, you will find a detailed and comprehensive answer under # 763, which describes things which the living can do for the benefit of the dead. Finally, we console you with the words with which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) consoled a mother whose son had died: To Allaah belongs whatever He takes and whatever He gives. Everything has an appointed time with Him. Have patience and hope of a reward from Him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 6829). May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Women do not have to pray Salaat al-Jumu’ah (Friday prayer). Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “As regards women, there is no difference (among the scholars) concerning the fact that Jumu’ah is not obligatory for them.” (Al-Mughni ma’a al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 2/151). But if a woman prays Jumu’ah in the mosque, then she should pray two rak’ahs, just like the men. Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Jumu’ah is not obligatory for one who is weak because of sickness or who has another valid excuse, or for women, but if any of these people attend Jumu’ah, they should pray two rak’ahs.” (al-Muhallaa, 5/81). So if a woman goes to the mosque and prays Jumu’ah, this is good enough, and she does not have to pray Zuhr too. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Reading the Qur’aan brings a great reward. Allaah will multiply the reward for every letter of every aayah in any soorah that is read, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever reads one letter of the Book of Allaah will have one hasanah (reward) for doing so, and every hasanah will be multiplied by 10. I do not say that ‘Alif, laam, meem’ is one letter, but ‘Alif’ is a letter, ‘laam’ is a letter and ‘meem’ is a letter.’” (Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 2835). He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: “Read the Qur’aan, for it will come on the Day of Resurrection interceding for its companions (i.e., those who read it)…” (Reported by Muslim, 1337) This reward will only be for the one who reads it sincerely, following the Sunnah. But the one who innovates in his readings (whether it be in the way he reads, the position he adopts when reading, the number of times he reads or the times when he reads) will not earn the reward, rather his deeds will be rejected and thrown back at him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected.” (Reported by Muslim, 3242). According to another report, he said: “Whoever does something that is not a part of this matter of ours, will have it rejected.” (Reported by Muslim, 3243) Because a specific time – Friday night – is being allocated and the reading is being done in congregation although no saheeh evidence to that effect has been reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), this action is bid’ah and is not prescribed or allowed by sharee’ah. It should therefore be avoided. We ask Allaah to guide us all to the truth and help us to follow the Sunnah. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.When a believer enters Paradise, if his wife was righteous then she will be his wife in Paradise too. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “‘And (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), which they shall enter and (also) those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their offspring. And angels shall enter unto them from every gate…” [al-Ra’d 13:23]. Imaam Ibn Jareer al-Tabari said in Jaami’ al-Bayaan ‘an Ta’weel Aayi’l-Qur’aan (16/423): “[In the phrase] those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their offspring, Allaah, may He be glorified, is saying that there will be admitted to Paradise those who He describes as those who (interpretations of the meanings) fulfil the Covenant of Allaah, those who join that which Allaah has commanded to be joined [i.e., upholding the ties of kinship] and fear their Lord, and who remain patient, seeking their Lord’s Countenance, [and] perform al-Salaah – those who do the deeds mentioned in the three preceding aayaat. Those who acted righteously from among their fathers, and their wives, and their offspring refers to their wives, their families and their offspring, and their ‘righteousness’ is their faith in Allaah and their obedience to His commands and the commands of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” They will be with their spouses, reclining in the shade of Paradise, filled with the deepest joy. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “They and their wives will be in pleasant shade, reclining on thrones.” [Yaa-Seen 36:56] “Enter Paradise, you and your wives, in happiness.” [al-Zukhruf 43:70] Among the bountiful and abundant blessings that Allaah bestows upon His creation is that if the believers’ offspring follow them in faith, they will be joined with their fathers in the same level of Paradise even if they themselves did not reach that level, so that their fathers may have the joy of seeing their offspring. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in Faith, - to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything…” [al-Toor 52:21] And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Names of some surahs Commentary on the Book Dalail al-Khayrat Does the translation of the Quran count as the Quran itself? Virtues of Surat al-Ikhlas Virtues of “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin” Praise be to Allah.Names of some surahs Firstly, the better-known names and numbers of the surahs about which you ask are as follows: Surah al-Hamdu is Surat al-Fatihah (the Opening), Surah #1 Surah Inna Fatahna is Surat al-Fath (the Victory), Surah #48 Allahus-Samad is Surat al-Ikhlas (the Purity), Surah #112 'Amma yatasa alun is Surat al-Naba (the Great News), Surah #78 The verse “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin (None has the right to be worshipped except You [O Allah]. Glorified (and Exalted) are You. Truly, I have been of the wrong-doers) is from Surat al-Anbiya, Surah 21, Verse 87. Commentary on the Book Dalail al-Khayrat A word of warning: The book Dalail al-Khayrat contains weak and fabricated hadiths, and prescribes things that are contrary to the truth, so it is not right for anyone to rely on this book. Does the translation of the Quran count as the Quran itself? A translation of the Quran in English or any other language is not counted as Quran itself, and the rulings that apply to Quran do not apply to it. The Quran is the Word of Allah which was revealed in the Arabic tongue. Virtues of Surat al-Ikhlas Al-Ahad (the One) and al-Samad (the Self-Sufficient) are two of the great Names of Allah . Stating that Surat al-Ikhlas should be recited 500 times, and that the verse (interpretation of the meaning) La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin (None has the right to be worshipped except You [O Allah]. Glorified (and Exalted) are You. Truly, I have been of the wrong-doers) [al-Anbiya 21:87] should be recited 100 times is a practice that has no basis whatsoever in the Quran or the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so it is not right to adhere to these numbers. You should act upon the sound hadiths that describe the virtues of this surah and this verse. These reports include the following: From Qatadah ibn al-Nu'man (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that a man stayed up to worship Allah at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) just before dawn and recited Qul huwa Allahu ahad, but did not recite anything else. In the morning, the man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him about this, thinking that perhaps he was not doing enough. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran. (al-Bukhari, 4627). Ahmad reported from Abu Sa'id al-Khudri that a man said, O Messenger of Allah, I have a neighbour who prays at night and he only ever recites Qul huwa Allahu ahad as if he did not think much of this. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, it is equivalent to one-third of the Quran. (al-Musnad, 10965) Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to his Companions: Could any one of you not recite one third of the Quran in one night? They found the idea too difficult, and said, Who among us could do that, O Messenger of Allah? He said, Allahul-ahad, al- samad [i.e., Surat al-Ikhlas] is one third of the Quran. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4628) `Aishah reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed, he would cup his hands together, blow into them and recite into them Qul huwa Allahu ahad [Surat al-Ikhlas], Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-falaq [Surat al-Falaq] and Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-nas [Surat al-Nas] (these are the last 3 surahs of the Quran). Then he would wipe as much of his body as he could with his hands, starting with his head and face, and the front of his body. He would do this three times. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4630) `Aishah also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sent a man in charge of a small military campaign, and when he recited Quran whilst leading his companions in prayer, he would always end with Qul huwa Allahu ahad. When they came back, (his companions) mentioned that to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who told them to ask him why he did that. So they asked him, and he said, Because it is a description of the Most Merciful, and I love to recite it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Tell him that Allah loves him. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 6827) 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Abza reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to recite Sabbih isma Rabbik al-A'la (Surat al-A'la, #87), Qul ya ayyuhal-kafirun (Surat al-Kafirun, #109) and Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Surat al-Ikhlas, #112) in his witr prayer, and when he had finished, he would repeat Subhan al-Malik al-Quddus (Glory be to the King, the Holy) three times, making the last vowel long on the third recitation. (Reported by al-Nasai, 1721) 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir said: I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said to me, O 'Uqbah ibn 'Amir, shall I not teach you some Surahs the like of which have not been revealed in the Tawrat (Torah) or the Zabur (Psalms) or the Injil (Gospel) or in the Quran? There is no night that comes but you should not recite (i.e., every night you should recite) Qul huwa Allahu ahad [Surat al-Ikhlas], Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-falaq [Surat al-Falaq] and Qul a'udhu bi Rabbil-nas [Surat al-Nas]. 'Uqbah said: So every night I would recite them. It became my duty to recite them, because the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had commanded me to do so. (Musnad Ahmad, 16810) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard a man reciting Qul huwa Allahu ahad, and said, It is his right. They asked, O Messenger of Allah, what is his right? He said, Paradise is his right. (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 7669) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever recites Qul huwa Allahu ahad ten times, Allah will build for him a house in Paradise. (Sahih al-Jami' al-Saghir, 6472). So recite it as many times as you wish, without sticking to a certain number or time or way that is not prescribed by Shari`ah. Virtues of “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin” With regard to the verse “La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin”, the following report has been narrated concerning its virtues: Sa'd said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The call of Dhul-Nun [Yunus/Jonah], which he recited when he was in the belly of the fish, La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin. There is no Muslim who recites this in any situation, but Allah will respond to him. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3427, and classed as sahih in Sahih al-Jami', 3383). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Shall I not tell you of something which, if some of the misery and distress of this world befalls a man and he recites it, he will be relieved of his stress. It is the du'a of Dhul-Nun: La ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu min al-zalimin. (Reported by al-Hakim; Sahih al-Jami', 2605). We ask Allah to help us, you and all our Muslim brothers to gain beneficial knowledge and to do righteous deeds. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad. And Allah knows best.\n",

Is it permissible for him to have surgery to reduce them? He (may Allaah preserve him) replied as follows: You must try to lose weight, then the fat around the breast will be reduced. If what you have is not a result of fat (and it is causing you trouble), and you can do an operation to reduce it without any harm involved, that will be OK.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It seems that you are confusing matters of the heart with matters of aqeedah and religion, because you state in your question that you were emotionally devastated when this woman left you and went back to her kaafir boyfriend. You need to keep matters of belief and religion separate from your emotions and personal desires. Adhere to the limits set by Allaah, and follow His rules, one of which is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Let no man guilty of fornication or adultery marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such a woman; to the Believers such a thing is forbidden. [al-Noor 24:3] It is not permitted to marry such a woman unless she repents, and this woman has not repented, she has gone back to committing haraam deed with a kaafir. So do not waste your time feeling regret about her. Ask Allaah to bless you with a chaste, believing wife, one who fasts and prays and devoutly adheres to the limits set by Allaah. This is the kind of woman you should long for, not this impure woman whose interest in Islam was only a temporary, emotional affair. I also advise you to adhere to the shareeah when calling non-Muslims to Islam, and not to treat the matter of speaking to non-mahram women (women to whom you are not related) lightly. You should not start any kind of forbidden contact or relationship with them in the name of dawah. The Muslim man should use indirect means of communication when calling non-Muslim women to Islam, such as giving them books or tapes, or communicating with them via e-mail, etc., within the bounds of what is right and proper. We ask Allaah to guide us all and make us content with what is halaal so that we will have no desire for anything that is haraam. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.One of the aims of shareeah is to protect peoples honour and to preserve lineages (keep them legitimate). For this reason, marriage has been prescribed, and fornication, adultery, sodomy and lesbianism have been forbidden. All the things that may lead to the above have also been forbidden, such as looking at non-mahram women (women to whom one is not closely related), mixing with them or being alone with them. Dressing improperly and forming friendships with the opposite sex have also been forbidden. All of this is aimed at preventing the provocation of desires, and at directing desires into legitimate channels instead of letting them find forbidden means of expression. One of the principles of shareeah is that whatever leads to haraam deeds is itself haraam, so everything that leads to the provocation of haraam desires is haraam, because it may lead to a person falling into fornication and adultery. Once desire has been provoked, it invariably means that a person has to find a way of satisfying it, and so he or she commits a haraam act. Reading stories and magazines with sexual content, and looking at dirty pictures and movies provokes these kinds of desires and leads to haraam deeds, so they are not allowed. We should avoid them and keep away from them. Warn your friend about this and tell her to repent by keeping away from these things and getting rid of any bad books, movies etc. that she still has. She should feel remorse for the past, and should do more righteous deeds from now on. We ask Allaah to grant us all chastity and good health, to purify our hearts and to accept our repentance, for He is the Acceptor of repentance, the Most-Merciful.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Any act of worship must be based on evidence (daleel) from the Quraan or saheeh Sunnah. One of the principles of this religion is that Allaah cannot be worshipped except in the ways that He has prescribed, and He cannot be worshipped in innovated ways (bidah). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours [i.e., Islam] that is not part of it, will have it rejected, i.e., his deed will be unacceptable to Allaah. There is no evidence in either the Quraan or Sunnah for ending duaas with al-Faatihah. Similarly, there is no evidence for blowing onto ones fingers and wiping the eyes with them after making duaa. Al-Shuqayri (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned the bidah of kissing the thumbnails and wiping the eyes with them after making duaa following salaah, or bunching the fingertips together and touching them to the eyes after prayer, and reciting certain things whilst doing so; he said that these are silly innovations. (Al-Sunan wal-Mubtadaaat, p. 71). With regard to the question of kissing the Mus-haf (copy of the Arabic text of the Quraan), the Fatwa Standing Committee (al-Lajnah al-Daaimah lil-Iftaa) answered a question on this matter with the following fatwa: We know of no basis for kissing the Quraan. In another response to a similar question, they said: We know of no evidence that prescribes kissing the Quraan, which was revealed to be recited, respected, understood and acted upon. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, no. 4172) In Al-Aadaab al-Shariyyah (2/273, Al-Risaalah edition), Ibn Muflih says: It was reported that he (Imaam Ahmad) did not give an opinion [??] on this matter (kissing the Quraan) and touching it to one's forehead and eyes. Al-Qaadi said in al-Jaami al-Kabeer: He did not give an opinion on that, although it contains an element of respect and honour, because in the case of deeds intended to draw closer to Allaah, if there is no comparable precedent in the Sunnah, then it is better not to do it. Do you not remember when Umar saw the Black Stone, he said: You cannot do any harm or any good. If it were not for the fact that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed you, I would not kiss you. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1597; Muslim, 1270). As for swaying when reciting Quraan or praying, this is habit of the Jews in their worship, so the Muslim should not do it deliberately. (See Bida al-Qurra by Bakr Abu Zayd, p. 57). One of the ways of wisdom (hikmah) in dawah and combatting wrongdoing, to which you refer in your question, is to ask people for the evidence for what they are doing, because it is not permissible to worship in ways for which there is no evidence, as we have pointed out above. The burden of proof rests on the person who is doing the deed, not on the one who is seeking to correct him. May Allaah give us and you the strength to do good. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.and peace and blessings be upon the one after whom there is no Prophet. A Muslim cannot inherit from a kaafir, and a kaafir cannot inherit from a Muslim, because of the hadeeth reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslim does not inherit from the kaafir, and the kaafir does not inherit from the Muslim.” [This applies] even if the money were to be used for the purpose of sadaqah, because of the general applicability of the hadeeth, and because the Muslim is not commanded to do something haraam in order to achieve something prescribed by Islam. And Allaah knows best. This is what Shaykh ‘Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz said when I asked him about this matter. He said, “He should not ask for his inheritance even if he wants to give it away in charity, but if he is given the money, he can dispose of it through any charitable channel.

      "Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Shanqeeti said in his book Daf Ayhaam al-Idtiraab an Aayaat al-Kitaab (p. 158): The aayah (interpretation of the meaning) And, verily, a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you reckon [al-Hajj 22:47] indicates that the length of a day with Allaah is a thousand years. The same is indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth, then it (the affair) will go up to Him, in one Day, the space whereof is a thousand years of your reckoning. [al-Sajdah 32:5]. Another aayah indicates something different (interpretation of the meaning): The angels and the Rooh [Jibreel] ascend to Him in a Day the measure whereof is fifty thousand years [al-Maaarij 70:4]. There are two ways in which these aayaat may be reconciled: The first was reported by Ibn Abi Haatim via Sammaak from Ikrimah from Ibn Abbaas: the day of a thousand years mentioned in Soorat al-Hajj is one of the six days in which Allaah created the heavens and the earth; the day of a thousand years mentioned in Soorat al-Sajdah is the length of time it takes for a matter to go up to Allaah; and the day of fifty thousand years is the Day of Resurrection. The second (way of reconciling the aayaat) is that what is meant by all of them is the Day of Resurrection, and the difference in the time span depends on whether a person is a believer or a kaafir. This is indicated by the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Truly that Day will be a Hard Day, far from easy for the disbelievers. [al-Muddaththir 74:9-10]. These two suggestions were mentioned by the author of al-Itqaan. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Thank you for your question, which shows an interest in the Quran. We are happy to answer your question here. There are in the Quran certain aayaat (verses) which some scholars call the verses of the Ten Commandments, because they include ten important commandments given by Allaah to mankind. These aayaat are to be found in two passages of the Quran. The first is in Soorat al-Anaam, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Say: Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to al-fawaahish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand. And come not near to the orphan's property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice. We burden not any person, but that which he can bear. And whenever you give your word (i.e., judge between men or give evidence, etc.), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfil the Covenant of Allaah. This He commands you, that you may remember. And, verily, this (i.e., Allaah's commandments mentioned in the above two verses) is my Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious). [al-Anaam 6:151-153] The second passage occurs in Soorat al-Israa, and may be considered as a commentary on the passage quoted above. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them, but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was small. Your Lord knows best what is in your inner-selves. If you are righteous, then, verily, He is ever Most-Forgiving to those who turn unto Him again and again in obedience, and in repentance. And give to the kindred his due and to the poor and to the wayfarer. But spend not wastefully (your wealth) in the manner of a spendthrift. Verily, spendthrifts are brothers of the shayaateen (devils), and the Shaytaan (Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord. And if you turn away from them (kindred, poor, wayfarers, etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but if you have no money at the time they ask you for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then, speak unto them a soft kind word (i.e., Allaah will give to me and I will give to you). And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, not stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty. Truly, your Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Verily, He is Ever All-Knower, All-Seer of His slaves. And kill not your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Surely the killing of them is a great sin. And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him). And do not kill anyone which Allaah has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed (intentionally with hostility and oppression and not by mistake), We have given his heir the authority [to demand qisaas Law of Equality in punishment or to forgive, or to take Diya (blood money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of taking life (i.e., he should not kill except the killer only). Verily, he is helped (by the Islamic law). And come not near to the orphan's property except to improve it, until he attains the age of full strength. And fulfil (every) covenant. Verily! The covenant will be questioned about. And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good (advantageous) and better in the end. And follow not (O man, i.e., say not, or do not or witness not, etc.) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be questioned by Allaah. And walk not on the earth with conceit and arrogance. Verily, you can neither rend nor penetrate the earth, nor can you attain a stature like that of the mountains in height. All the bad aspects of these (the above mentioned things) are hateful to your Lord. This is part of al-hikmah (wisdom, good manners and high character, etc.) which your Lord has inspired to you (O Muhammad). And set not up with Allaah any other ilaah (god) lest you should be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and rejected (from Allaahs mercy). [al-Israa 17:23-39] Perhaps after enjoying reading these verses, you will have a better idea of the Quraan than before, and this will be the beginning of a fundamental change in your life, the start of your way to Islam. May Allaah guide and help you always. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance. .\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.The Signs of the Hour are the signs that will precede Yawm al-Qiyaamah (the Day of Judgement) and indicate that it is nigh. The Hour (al-Saa'ah) means the time of reckoning, and is either: 1. Saa'ah sughra (the lesser hour), which is a person's death, whereupon his reckoning starts when he leaves this world and passes into the Hereafter; 2. Or Saa'ah kubraa (the greater Hour), which is when mankind will be resurrected from their graves to be judged and rewarded or punished accordingly. When the word al-saa'ah is used on its own in the Qur'aan, it refers to the greater reckoning (the Day of Judgement), as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): \"People ask you concerning the Hour\" [al-Ahzaab 33:63] The Signs of the Hour (i.e., the Day of Judgement) are of two types: 1. Ashraat al-Saa'ah al-Sughra (Minor signs of the Hour) These are signs that will appear a long time before the Hour approaches, such as the decline of knowledge, the spread of ignorance, drinking of wine or alcohol, competition in the construction of tall buildings, and many others. The scholars have listed almost sixty signs, some of which will accompany the major signs, or will appear afterwards. 2. Ashraat al-Saa'ah al-Kubraa (Major Signs of the Hour) These are major signs that will appear shortly before the Day of Judgement comes. These extraordinary events will be: (1) The appearance of the Mahdi. At the end of time, a man from the descendents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will appear, and Allaah will help him to make His religion prevail. He will take control of the land (or the earth) and fill it with justice just as it had previously been filled with wrongdoing and oppression. Under his rule, the ummah will be blessed as it has never been blessed before. This man's name will be like the name of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and his father's namewill be like the Messenger's father's name. He will be a descendant of Faatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), through the line of al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him). He will appear from the East. A number of saheeh ahaadeeth refer to the appearance of the Mahdi, including the following: 1. Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"During the last days of my ummah, the Mahdi will appear. Allaah will send rain for him, and the earth will bring forth its produce. He will give money sihaahan (according to one report, the Prophet was asked, \"What is sihaahan?\" and he said, \"Equally among people.\" Reported by Ahmad), and livestock will increase He will live for seven or eight\" - meaning years. (Reported by al-Haakim, 4/557; he said it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim]. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Shaykh al-Albaani said: its sanad is saheeh. Al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 711) 2. Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: 'The Mahdi will be of my family (according to one report: of the people of my household) [Reported by Ibn Hibbaan and by al-Haakim in al-Mustadrak. He said: this hadeeth is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs, but they did not report it. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him] from the children of Faatimah.\" [Reported by Abu Dawood, 11/373 and Ibn Maajah, 2/1368. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', section 6610]. Al-'Allaamah al-Safaareeni said: \"So many reports were narrated concerning the appearance of the Mahdi that they reached the level of Tawaatur in meaning, and this became so well known among the scholars of Sunnah that it is counted as one of their basic beliefs.\" (Lawaami' al-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah, 2/84). [Tawaatur: a mutawaatir hadeeth is one that was narrated by so many people and transmitted by so many people that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie. Translator] Imaam al-Shawkaani said: \"The mutawaatir ahaadeeth about the awaited Mahdi, which we managed to find and examine, number fifty, including saheeh, hasan and da'eef munjabir (weak ahaadeeth that are supported by corroborating evidence) reports. They are mutawaatir beyond any shadow of a doubt The reports from the Sahaabah that speak about the Mahdi are also very many and are judged as having the status of marfoo' ahaadeeth (i.e., ahaadeeth whose isnaads go back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because this is not an issue in which they would have made ijtihaad.\" (For more information, see Question #1252). (2) Al-Maseeh al-Dajjaal (The \"Antichrist\") Al-Maseeh al-Dajjaal is a man from the sons of Aadam. He has a number of features which were mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth, including the following: he will be a young man with a ruddy complexion and curly hair, and will be one-eyed, with his right eye looking like a floating grape. Between his eyes will be written \"ka' fa' ra'\" (in unjoined letters) or \"kaafir\" (disbeliever), which every Muslim, literate or illiterate, will be able to read. Another of his attributes will be that he is sterile, and will have no children. Among the ahaadeeth that describe him are the following: 1. Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whilst I was sleeping, (I dreamt that) I was doing Tawaaf around the House (the Ka'bah).\" He mentioned that he saw 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace, then he saw the Dajjaal, and he described him: \"He is a well-built man, with a ruddy complexion and curly hair. He is one-eyed, with his eye looking like a floating grape. (Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath, 6/485: i.e., it is sticking out. The word yatfaa, with no hamzah, is used to describe something that is on top of something else. It is likened to a grape which is part of the bunch but sticks out from the rest. Al-Nawawi said: the word has been narrated both with the hamzah and without the hamzah. With the hamzah it means that the light has gone out of the eye, and without the hamzah it means that it is sticking out.) They said: \"This is the Dajjaal\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 13/90, and Muslim, 2/237) 2. Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described the Dajjaal as living among people, and said: \"Allaah, may He be exalted, is not one-eyed, but al-Maseeh al-Dajjaal is one-eyed, and his right eye looks like a floating grape.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 13/90, and Muslim, 18/59) 3. 'Imraan ibn Husayn (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: \"Between the creation of Aadam and the onset of the Day of Judgement, there will be a creation greater than the Dajjaal.\" (Reported by Muslim, 18/86). [This means that] the Dajjaal will appear from the East, from Khurasaan, from among the Jews of Isfahaan, then he will travel around the world, leaving no country but he will enter it, except for Makkah and Madeenah, which he will not be able to enter because the angels are guarding them, as is reported in the hadeeth of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him): \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that the Dajjaal would appear from a land in the East called Khurasaan.\" (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 6/495); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', section 3398). The fitnah (trial, tribulation) of the Dajjaal will be the greatest fitnah ever, seen from the time that Allaah created Aadam until the onset of the Day of Judgement, and this will be because of the power that Allaah will permit him to have, of working great miracles that will amaze and confuse the people. There are ahaadeeth that describe how he will have a \"paradise\" and a \"hell\", but his paradise will in fact be a hell, and vice versa. He will have rivers of water and mountains of bread. He will command the sky to rain, and it will rain, and he will command the earth to bring forth its produce, and it will bring forth its produce. The treasures of the earth will follow him, and he will travel though the earth at great speed, like rain driven by the wind. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his ummah how they can protect themselves from the evil of the fitnah of the Dajjaal, as is reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"When any one of you pronounces the Shahaadah, let him seek refuge with Allaah from four things, and let him say: 'Allaahumma innee a'oodhu bika min 'adhaab jahannam, wa min 'adhaab al-qabr, wa min fitnati'l-mahyaa wa'l-mamaat, wa min sharri fitnati'l-maseeh al-dajjaal (O Allaah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of Hell, from the punishment of the grave, from the trials of life and death, and from the evil of the tribulation of the Dajjaal).\" (Reported by Muslim, 5/87). Another way of protecting oneself is by memorizing the first aayaat of Soorat al-Kahf. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined reciting the first verses of Soorat al-Kahf against the Dajjaal, by reciting the first ten verses, as was reported by al-Nawwaas ibn Sam'aan, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever of you encounters him (the Dajjaal), let him recite the first verses of Soorat al-Kahf against him.\" (Reported by Muslim, 18/65). Abu'l-Dardaa' (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Whoever memorizes ten aayaat from the beginning of Soorat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjaal.\" (Reported by Muslim, 6/92). The destruction of the will come at the hands of 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace, as is indicated in the saheeh ahaadeeth. 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Amr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'The Dajjaal will emerge among my ummah and Allaah will send 'Eesaa ibn Maryam and he will pursue him and destroy him.\" (Reported by Muslim, 18/75). (3) The descent of 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace After the Dajjaal has appeared and spread corruption throughout the earth, Allaah will send 'Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace, who will descend to the earth, coming down to the white minaret in the East of Damascus, Syria, resting his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, drops will fall, and when he raises it, drops like large pearls will fall (these are like grains of silver in the shape of big pearls, and it means that drops of water as pure as pearls will fall. The water is described as pearls because of its purity). No kaafir will smell his breath except he will die, and his breath will reach as far as his eyes can see. He will come down to the victorious group that is fighting for the truth and has come together to fight the Dajjaal. He will descend at the time when the iqaamah for prayer is being given, and he will pray behind the leader of that group. The reports about his descent are many, including the following: 1. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"By the One in Whose hand is my soul, it is nearly time for the son of Maryam to descend upon you, to judge fairly. He will break the cross, kill the pigs and put an end to war. Wealth will increase so much that no-one will accept it, and one prostration to Allaah will be worth more than the world and all that is in it.\" Then Abu Hurayrah said: \"Recite, if you wish: 'And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him ('Eesaa - as a human Messenger of Allaah) before his ('Eesaa's) death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he ('Eesaa) will be a witness against them.\" [Al-Nisaa' 4:159 - interpretation of the meaning].'\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/490, and Muslim, 2/189). 2. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"How will you be when 'Eesaa ibn Maryam descends to you and your leader is one of you?\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/491, and Muslim, 2/193). Imaam Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer (7/223): \"Mutawaatir ahaadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) describe how 'Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend before the Day of Judgement as a just leader and fair ruler.\" (4) Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj (Gog and Magog) Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are human beings, descended from Aadam and Hawwa, upon whom be peace. According to the descriptions of them given in the ahaadeeth, they belong to the Turkic Mongol race, having small eyes, small, flat noses and wide faces. Their faces look like hammered-out shields (their faces are likened to shields because they are wide and round). Their appearance at the end of time is one of the signs of the Hour, as indicated in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): \"Until, when Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are let loose (from their barrier), and they swiftly swarm from every mound. And the true promise (Day of Resurrection) shall draw near (to fulfilment). Then (when mankind is resurrected from their graves, you shall see the eyes of the disbelievers fixedly stare in horror. (They will say): 'Woe to us! We were indeed heedless of this; nay, but we were zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.).\" [al-Anbiyaa' 21:96-97] In the story of Dhoo'l-Qarnayn, Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then he followed (another) way, until, when he reached between two mountains, he found, before (near) them (those two mountains), a people who scarcely understood a word. They said: 'O Dhoo'l-Qarnayn! Verily! Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them?' He said: 'That (wealth, authority and power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than your tribute). So help me with strength (of men), I will erect between you and them a barrier. Give me pieces (blocks) or iron,' then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs, he said, 'Blow,' till when he had made it (red as) fire, he said, 'Bring me molten copper to pour over it.' So they [Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj] were made powerless to scale it or dig through it. (Dhoo'l-Qarnayn) said: 'This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the Promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down to the ground. And the Promise of my Lord is ever true.' And on that Day [i.e., the day Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj will come out], We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another, and the Trumpet will be blown, and We shall collect them all together.\" [al-Kahf 18:92-99] Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are also mentioned in the Sunnah, in more than one hadeeth, including the following: 1. Umm Habeebah bint Abi Sufyaan reported from Zaynab bint Jahsh that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon her one day in a nervous state, saying, \"La ilaaha ill-Allaah! Woe to the Arabs from the evil that has approached! Today a hole this big has appeared in the barrier of Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj,\" and he made a circle with his thumb and forefinger. Zaynab bint Jahsh said, \"O Messenger of Allaah, will we be destroyed even though there are righteous people among us?\" He said, \"Yes, if evil becomes widespread.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/381, Muslim, 18/2). 2. Al-Nawaas ibn Sam'aan (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported a long hadeeth describing several signs of the Hour. In this hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \" and Allaah will send Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj, swiftly swarming from every mound. They will pass the lake of Tiberias [in Palestine] and will drink everything that is in it. Then the last of them will pass by and will say, 'There used to be water here once.' The Prophet of Allaah, 'Eesaa, and his companions, will be besieged until a bull's head will be more precious to one of them than a hundred dinars are to any of you today. 'Eesaa and his companions will pray to Allaah, and Allaah will send a kind of worm (like that found in the noses of camels and sheep) on their (Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj) necks, and they will fall down dead, all at once. Then 'Eesaa and his companions will come down out of the place where they were besieged, and they will find hardly a handspan of land that is not filled with the stench (of Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj), so 'Eesaa and his companions will pray to Allaah, and He will send birds like the necks of camels to carry them away and throw them wherever Allaah wills.\" (Reported by Muslim, 18/68). (5) The swallowing up of the earth This means that a place is swallowed up in the earth and disappears into it, as is described in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): \"So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place\" [al-Qasas 28:81]. Among the major signs of the Hour will be three such events, as described in the hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn Usayd (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The Hour will not begin until you see ten signs (including) three events where the earth swallows up, one in the East, one in the West, and one in the Arabian Peninsula.\" (Reported by Muslim, 18/27). These events, like other major signs of the Hour, have not happened yet. Although other instances of places being swallowed up by the earth have occurred at various times and in various places, they did not cover so wide an area as to include both East and West. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \"There have been instances of places being swallowed up by the ear, but it could be that what is meant by the three events referred to is events that are worse than anything yet seen, which could be more intense and cover a larger area.\" (Fath al-Baari, 13/84). (6) The smoke Another of the major signs of the Hour will be the appearance of the smoke. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"Then wait you for the Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people, this is a painful torment.\" [al-Dhukhaan 44:10-11]. A definition of the smoke was narrated from Ibn 'Abbaas, who explained that it is one of the Signs of the Day of Judgement, as was narrated by Ibn Jareer and Ibn Abi Haatim from 'Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Maleekah, who said: \"I went to Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) one day, and he said: 'I did not sleep at all last night.' I asked him, 'Why not?' He said, 'They said that a star with a tail (a comet) had appeared, and I was afraid that the smoke had started, so I could not sleep at all.'\" Imaam Ibn Katheer commented: \"This is a saheeh isnaad, going back to Ibn 'Abbaas, the scholar of the ummah and the interpreter of the Qur'aan. This is also the opinion of all the Sahaabah and Taabi'een who agreed with him, in addition, there are many ahaadeeth going back to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) - saheeh, hasan and others - which state the same thing. This is convincing evidence that the smoke will be one of the expected signs, as is also clear from the text of the Qur'aan.\" (Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 7/235). Among the ahaadeeth that describe the appearance of the smoke as one of the signs of the Hour is the following: 1. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Hasten to do good deeds before six things appear: the Dajjaal, the smoke\" (Reported by Muslim, 18/87) (7) The rising of the sun from the West Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \" The day that some of the Signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith\" [al-An'aam 6:158]. Most of the mufassireen (commentators) state that one of these signs is the rising of the sun from the West. Among the reports that indicate this are: 1. The hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) according to which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The Hour will not begin until the sun rises from the West, and when it rises and the people see it, they will all believe, but that will be when it will do a person no good to believe, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 11/352, and Muslim, 2/194). 2. The hadeeth of 'Abd-Allaah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'Aas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: \"I learned from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a hadeeth that I have never forgotten since. I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: 'The first of the signs of the Hour to appear will be the rising of the sun from the West.'\" (Reported by Muslim, 18/78). (8) The appearance of the Beast Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast to them, which will speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in our aayaat.\" [al-Naml 27:82] Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'There are three things which, once they happen, it will do a person no good to believe, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his faith: the rising of the sun from the West, the Dajjaal, and the Beast of the earth.'\" (Reported by Muslim, 2/195). Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The Beast will emerge, and it will mark all the people on their noses, and this mark will last, so that if a man buys a camel, and is asked who he bought it from, he will say, 'From the man with the mark on his nose.'\" (Reported by Ahmad and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, no. 322). According to some reports, when the Beast appears, it will mark the believers and the kaafirs. As for the believer, it will make his face shine brightly, as a sign of his faith, and as for the kaafir, it will mark his nose with a sign of his disbelief. The Qur'aan tells us that the Beast will speak to people, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): \"And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast to them, which will speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in our aayaat.\" [al-Naml 27:82]. This kalaam may refer to actual speech, whereby the Beast will address people, which is supported by the reading of Ubayy ibn Ka'b (tunabbi'uhum, i.e., tell them), or it may convey the other meaning of the word kalaam, to wound, which is supported by the alternative reading (taklamuhum, i.e., mark them by cutting them) reported from Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him). (9) The fire which will gather the people together Another of the signs of the Hour is the great fire which will appear from the direction of Yemen, from the bottom of 'Aden, from the Sea of Hadramawt. Among the ahaadeeth that describe this are the following: 1. The hadeeth of Hudhayfah ibn Usayd which mentions the major signs of the Hour, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \" The last of them will be a fire which will emerge from Yemen, and will drive the people to their gathering place.\" According to another report: \" and a fire which will emerge from the bottom of 'Aden and drive the people (ahead of it).\" (Reported by Muslim, 18/27). 2. The hadeeth of Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) which states that when 'Abd-Allaah ibn Salaam embraced Islam, he asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about a number of issues, including the first sign of the Hour. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The first sign of the Hour will be a fire which will drive the people from East to West.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6/362). 3. Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: \"The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Fire will emerge from Hadramawt or from the sea of Hadramawt (according to another report: from the direction of Hadramawt or from Hadramawt - Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh) before the Day of Judgement, and it will drive the people (ahead of it).'\" (Reported by Ahmad, 7/133; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami', 3603). A number of saheeh ahaadeeth describe how this fire will gather the people together. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"The people will be gathered in three ways, willingly or by force, two on one camel, or three or four or even ten on one camel. The rest of them will be gathered together by means of a fire, which will stay with them whenever they stop to rest or to sleep, no matter what the time of day or night.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 11/377, Muslim, 17/194). Finally, it should be noted that belief in the signs of the Hour is part of our belief in the Unseen (al-ghayb), without which the belief of the Muslim is incomplete. And Allaah is the Source of Strength..\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.What you should do is advise the person who is committing sin, whether the sin hurts you directly or not, because enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil is an important obligation which Muslims are supposed to do all the time, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And when a community among them said: ‘Why do you preach to a people whom Allaah is about to destroy or to punish with a severe torment?’ (the preachers) said: ‘In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allaah), and perhaps they may fear Allaah.’” [al-A’raaf 7:164] In his tafseer (commentary) of this aayah, Ibn Katheer said: “Here Allaah is describing how the people of that town had split into three groups: those who committed sin by using tricks to catch fish on the Sabbath (which Allaah had forbidden them to do), those who told them not to do this wrong deed and boycotted them, and those who kept quiet, neither committing the sin not speaking out against it. But this third group said to those who were telling the sinners not to do it: ‘Why do you preach to a people whom Allaah is about to destroy or punish with a severe torment?’ i.e., why do you warn these people when you know they are doomed and they deserve to be punished by Allaah, and your telling them not to do it is of no benefit? The preachers said to them, ‘In order to be free from guilt before your Lord (Allaah),’ i.e., we are doing this out of obedience to your Lord, Who has instructed us to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil; ‘and perhaps they may fear Allaah,’ i.e., perhaps this warning may make them stop what they are doing and return to Allaah in repentance, for if they repent, Allaah will accept their repentance and have mercy on them.” The Muslim should use different styles of warning and calling people to Islam. Sometimes he uses a soft and encouraging tone, describing the rewards for obedience; sometimes he warns of the punishment for disobedience; sometimes he may tell stories which illustrate an important lesson; sometimes he explains the bad consequences of sin on the person’s life, and so on. If a person can no longer bear to be close to this sinner, and there is no benefit in advising him, then he should keep away from him and have nothing to do with him. And Allaah is the source of strength and the Guide to the right path.\n",

      "Contents Related What is vinegar? Ruling on wine made from vinegar Why is it not permissible to change wine to vinegar References Praise be to Allah.What is vinegar? Vinegar is a well-known basic foodstuff, made from wine of which the composition has changed so that it is no longer sweet but is acidic or sour. Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What a good food vinegar is.” (Reported by Muslim, 3/1623) Ruling on wine made from vinegar When wine turns to vinegar by itself, without any deliberate treatment needed for it to be changed, it is permissible to eat, drink and handle, according to the consensus of the scholars, because of the hadith quoted above. But if the wine has become vinegar because of deliberate treatment, by adding vinegar, onions, salt etc., or by any other process, in this case the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) differ as to whether it is permissible. The Shafi’is, Hanbalis and some of the Malikis say that it is not permissible to deliberately change wine to vinegar because then it is not pure. The evidence for this is the hadith of Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked whether wine could be changed to be used as vinegar. He said, ‘No.’” (Reported by Muslim). Abu Talhah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was asked about some orphans who had inherited some wine. He said, “Pour it away.” He was asked, “Could they not make it into vinegar?” He said, “No.” (Reported by Muslim). Why is it not permissible to change wine to vinegar The reason for this is: Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has commanded us to avoid wine. Keeping it and treating it until it turns into vinegar means handling it and being involved with it by storing it and benefiting from it, and this is not permitted. It is permitted for a Muslim to buy vinegar from someone who is selling it, unless he realizes or comes to know that it was produced by means of a deliberate process. ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: “… There is nothing wrong with a man buying vinegar from the people of the Book, if they sell it, so long as he knows that they did not deliberately process it from wine.” (Al-Mughni, 8/330) And Allah knows best.

      "Praise be to Allah.It is regrettable indeed that anyone would fail to adhere to the religion which Allaah has commanded us to adhere to. What is even more distressing is the fact that a Muslim woman would have a relationship (of any kind) with a non-related Christian man for ten years, when she knows that this is something which angers Allaah, Who has forbidden believing women to do such things in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25]. Equally upsetting is the fact that what this Muslim girls father fears most with regard to the marriage described is not Allaah, but what his mother will say and how his reputation among his relatives will be affected. In any case, there is no way out of this problem now except one: this man must become Muslim in a real sense, and start to practise Islam, and he and this girl should repent for what they have done. Then marrying him will be permissible, and what people may say does not matter, so long as everything is done in accordance with Islam and in a way that will not earn the anger of Allaah; the matter can also be explained to close relatives. If this is not possible, then the relationship with this man should be cut completely, and all thought of him should be dismissed from ones mind. If, my sister, you feel that there is some harshness in this answer, then by Allaah it is only in your best interests and out of concern for you. We ask Allaah to accept our repentance and have mercy on us, for He is the One Who accepts repentance and is All-Merciful.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with ending a letter with the phrase “wa’l-salaam,” and it is not a condition that the phrase should be used in full, because when a written abbreviation is used, what the writer means is the complete expression. So when a person says “wa’l-salaam,” what he or she means is “wa’l-salaamu ‘alaykum.” But if the person sending the letter writes “wa’l-salaamu ‘alayka” or “wa’l-salaamu ‘alaykum” at the end, this is better. Umar ibn al-Khattaab ended his letter to the qaadi Shurayh with the words “wa’l-salaamu ‘alayka” [Sunan al-Nisaa’i, 5304] and ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ended his letter to one of his workers in the same way [Muwatta’ Malik, Kitaab al-jihaad]. Ibn Katheer reported in al-Bidaayah wa’l-Nihaayah from Ibn ‘Asaakir that Ziyaad ibn Abi Sufyaan sent Sa’eed ibn al-‘Aas gifts, money and a letter proposing marriage to his daughter. When the gifts, money and letter arrived, [Sa’eed] read the letter, shared out the gifts among the people sitting with him, then wrote a nice, polite letter back to him in which he said: “In the name of Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Allaah says: ‘Nay! Verily man does transgress all bounds (in disbelief and evil deeds, etc.), because he considers himself self-sufficient.’ [al-‘Alaq 96:6-7 – interpretation of the meaning]. Wa’l-salaam.” However, the person sending the letter should greet the addressee with the complete phrase (“Al-salaamu alaykum”) at the beginning of the letter, as has been the habit of the Muslims from the time of the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the present.

      "Praise be to Allah.Yes, you could become Muslim and still play basketball, so long as there is nothing forbidden or harmful involved. Islam does not forbid sports that exercise the body and strengthen its muscles. Indeed, it is the body’s right that its owner should take care of it, as the Prophet of Islam Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: \"Your body has a right over you.\" (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4800). One of the benefits of basketball is that it is based on aiming the ball correctly. So there is nothing wrong with playing it, so long as it is not combined with something forbidden such as gambling or deliberately harming or hitting others, and as long as it does not distract a person from praying and so on. By the way, I am sure that you are not unaware that there are a number of internationally known basketball players who have embraced Islam. Our advice to you is: don’t hesitate to enter Islam, for there is nothing to stop you.

      "Praise be to Allah.If a person has relatives, then it is obligatory to uphold the ties of kinship, even if they are not as one would like them to be, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years – give thanks unto Me and to your parents, - unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly…” [Luqmaan 31:14-15]. He did not say “kill them”, He said, “but behave with them in the world kindly…” Upholding the ties of kinship is obligatory even if the relatives are not as one would like them to be. So you must keep in touch with your relatives even if they have this dish, which most people use to view haraam things, waste their time and money, and corrupt their morals and minds. If they use the dish to watch haraam things when you are present, then do not go to them so that you will not be a partner in their sin, but still we advise people to pay attention to their duties towards their relatives, which include advising them, i.e., going to them and explaining to them that this – watching haraam things – is haraam. Then you will have done your duty of advising them and treating them well. (Liqa’ al-Baab al-Maftooh by Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 148). The Muslim must also pay attention to his children when they go to visit these relatives; he should not let his children sit with them when they are watching haraam things. The Muslim who is sincere can, if he is smart, divert the relatives and others with some interesting talk or useful activities to distract them from watching these haraam things; he can strive to make other, permissible forms of entertainment available (such as some sports activities or games or useful computer games, etc.) This will give the others an alternative to watching haraam things, at least in part.

This is a summary of Shar`i research presented to the Islamic Fiqh Council during its regular meetings: The following things do not have any effect on the fast: Eye drops , ear drops , ear syringing, nose drops and nasal sprays – so long as one avoids swallowing any material that may reach the throat. Tablets or lozenges that are placed beneath the tongue for the treatment of angina pectoris etc., so long as one avoids swallowing any material that reaches the throat. Vaginal pessaries, douching, use of a speculum, or internal digital examination. Introduction of a scope or coil (IUD), etc., into the uterus. Introduction of a scope or catheter into the urethra (male of female), or injection of dyes for diagnostic imaging, or of medication, or cleaning of the bladder. Drilling of teeth (prior to filling), extraction or polishing of teeth, using a miswak or toothbrush, so long as one avoids swallowing any material that reaches the throat. Rinsing, gargling or applying topical treatment in the mouth, so long as one avoids swallowing any material that reaches the throat. Injections, whether subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous – with the exception of those used for purposes of nutrition. Oxygen. Anaesthetics , so long as they do not supply nutrition to the patient. Medicines absorbed through the skin, such as creams, lotions and patches used to administer medication through the skin. Introduction of a catheter into the veins in order to examine or treat the vessels of the heart or other organs. Laparoscopy for the purpose of diagnosis or surgical treatment of the abdominal organs. Biopsies of the liver and other organs, so long as this is not accompanied by the administration of nutrients. Gastroscopy , so long as this is not accompanied by the administration of nutrients. Introduction of medicine or instruments into the brain or spinal cord. Involuntary vomiting (as opposed to self-induced vomiting).

      "Praise be to Allah.Part of the Grace and Kindness of Allaah towards the sons of Adam is that He has prescribed marriage for them, and has made it so that they produce offspring in this organized and proper fashion. Marriage is one of the strongest and most noble covenants in the sight of Allaah, and the family is the most important unit in the structure of society. It is essential that a person gives priority to putting his own house in order and strives to teach his family the laws of Allaah. One of the things that he should make sure he teaches his wife is the duties that she has towards her husband, and the rights that are due to her. Islam has stated these rights and duties, and it obliges and urges both spouses to fulfil them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And they (women) have rights (over their husbands) similar to (those of their husbands) over them to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [al-Baqarah 2:228] The aayah states that for every right there is a reciprocal duty which must be fulfilled. In this way balance is achieved between them in all aspects, which supports the stability of family life. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said concerning the aayah: It means: they have the right to good companionship and kind treatment on the part of their husbands, just as they have to obey their husbands in whatever they tell them to do. Ibn Zayd said: Fear Allaah concerning them just as they have to fear Allaah concerning you. Al-Qurtubi said: This aayah includes all the marital rights and duties. Among these rights and duties are: Turning a blind eye to faults and mistakes, especially words and deeds by which nothing bad was intended. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): those who repress anger, and who pardon men; verily Allaah loves as muhsinoon (the good-doers). [Aal Imraan 3:134] Both husband and wife must put up with one another, for every child of Adam may slip, and the person whom one should put up with the most is the one with whom one lives and mixes the most. Neither party should resort to a tit-for-tat response. If one spouse sees the other becoming very angry, he or she should restrain his or her own anger and not respond immediately. For this reason Abul-Darda (may Allaah be pleased with him) said to his wife: If you see me angry, calm me down, and if I see you angry I will calm you down, otherwise we cannot live together. Among the most important duties is: Each spouse should advise the other to obey Allaah. According to a saheeh hadeeth, some of the Sahaabah asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Can you tell us which kind of wealth is the best, so that we may strive to acquire it? He said: The best (wealth) is a remembering tongue (one which always remembers Allaah), a thankful heart, and a believing wife who will help you with your faith. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/278; al-Tirmidhi, 3039; Saheeh al-Jaami, 5231) A man should not hate his wife if he sees in her something that he dislikes, because if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will like another which will make up for it. It was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No believing man should hate a believing woman; if he dislikes one of her characteristics, he will be pleased with another. (Reported by Muslim, 36). Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Woman was created from a rib, and if you try to straighten the rib you will break it, so be gentle with her and you will be able to live with her. (Reported by Ahmad, 5/8; Ibn Maajah, 1308; Saheeh al-Jaami, 2/163). One of the most important things that can make married life happy is a good attitude, hence Islam raised its status. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reached the utmost heights of good treatment of others and good attitude. Abul-Darda reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is nothing that can be placed in the scales that will weigh heavier than a good attitude, and a good attitude can help a person reach the status of one who fasts and prays. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2003; Abu Dawood, 4799). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The most perfect of the believers in faith are those who are the best in attitude, and the best of you are those who are best to their women. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1/217; Ahmad, 2/250; al-Silsilah al-Saheehah, 284). Both spouses should turn a blind eye and avoid picking on matters great and small, or rebuking and scolding about any matter except duties towards Allaah. This is what Allaah tells us to do (interpretation of the meaning): And live with them (women) honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good. [al-Nisa 4:19]. As far as different environments are concerned, a man should take care to pay special attention to this, such as allowing his wife to mix with good women from among her surroundings and intelligent, well-mannered women from among your surroundings. Although she must obey you and not go out of your house without permission, at the same time you should not prevent her from going out to places where she wants to go, so long as there is nothing bad there. You should let her receive trustworthy women in her house, in order to have some social life and a refreshing change of routine, especially in our times when many women no longer obey the Divine command to remain in their homes and do not pay proper attention to it especially Muslim women who live in non-Muslim countries where there is too much freedom. We also advise you to give her some freedom of choice in issues that do not cause any harm, such as choosing food, colours for things in the house, or gifts to be given on various occasions. You should also seek her opinion in matters of concern to you both, such as naming your children knowing that this is your right according to Islam and where to spend your vacation. You should also involve her and seek her opinion when making some decisions in which it is appropriate to include her, such as dealing with behavioural problems in your children, finding ways to reconcile disputing relatives or neighbours, and especially in resolving the problems between the two of you. Try to raise her level of education with suitable reading material and attendance at gatherings where the program and fellow-attendees will help to achieve the desired aim. Such programs may be available in some Islamic centres. Know that paying attention to her intellectual level, working with her way of thinking, understanding her psychology, treating her appropriately, being good to her and making her feel good are among the most effective ways of showing how wise and manly you are and how good your personality is. We ask Allaah to reconcile between you and bring you back together, and help you both to do that which He likes and which pleases Him.\n",

      "Contents Related Who should receive a blood transfusion? Whose blood can be taken? Who should decide whether a blood transfusion is needed? Praise be to Allah.Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al al-Shaykh (may Allah have mercy on him) answered a question about blood transfusions as follows: In order to answer this question, we need to discuss three matters: 1. Who is the person who is to receive the blood transfusion? 2. Who is the person from whom the blood is to be taken? 3. Who is the person whom we can trust to decide whether a blood transfusion is needed? Who should receive a blood transfusion? With regard to the first question, the person who is to receive the blood transfusion is a person whose life is in danger due to sickness or injury, and whose life depends on his receiving a blood transfusion. The principle in this matter is based on the following verse of the Quran (interpretation of the meanings): “He has forbidden you only the maytatah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah. But if one is forced by necessity without willful disobedience nor transgressing the limits, then there is no sin on him…” [al-Baqarah 2:173] “… But as for him who is forced by severe hunger, with no inclination to sin (such can eat these above-mentioned meats), then surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Maidah 5:3] “… He has explained to you in detail what is forbidden to you, except under compulsion of necessity…” [al-An’am 6:119] The evidence derived from these verses tells us that if the recovery of the sick or injured person depends on a blood transfusion which he needs to save his life, and that there is no other medicine or food that can do the same thing, then it is permissible for him to receive a blood transfusion. In fact, this comes under the heading of nourishment, not medicine (using forbidden foodstuffs in cases of necessity is permissible, as in the case of a starving man eating dead meat). Whose blood can be taken? With regard to the second point, the one from whom blood is taken, this should not result in any serious harm, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There should be no causing harm nor reciprocating harm.” Who should decide whether a blood transfusion is needed? As regards the third point, which is the matter of whose opinion should be relied upon to decide whether a blood transfusion is needed, this should be a Muslim doctor. If that is not possible, we see nothing wrong with taking the word of a non-Muslim doctor, whether he is Jewish or Christian (or any other religion), so long as he is experienced in medicine and is trustworthy. The principle here is the sahih hadith which describes how the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hired a man of Bani Dil as a skilled and experienced guide, although he was a follower of the pagan religion of Quraysh. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2104.) (Fatawa al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim). Concerning this matter, the Hay’at Kibar al-‘Ulama (Council of Senior Scholars) stated the following: 1. It is permissible to donate blood , so long as this does not cause him any harm, when there is a need for it to help other Muslims. 2. It is permissible to establish Islamic blood banks to receive and store donated blood, to be kept for any Muslim who may be in need of it, so long as no money is charged to the sick person or the people in charge of his affairs in return for this service. A blood bank should not be set up as a commercial enterprise or a means of making money , because it is in the public interest of the Muslims. And Allah knows best\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Imitating means trying to be like someone, which the fuqahaa' understand to mean being similar in a certain way to the person whom one is imitating. The Muslim is not permitted to imitate the kuffaar by wearing clothing that is unique to them and for which they are known, like the belt worn by Christian monks, or the distinctive headgear of Magians (Zoroastrians) and Jews, because of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): \"Whoever imitates a people is one of them.\" (Reported by Abu Dawood, 4/314). The scholars have specified that the prohibition of imitation applies in two cases: 1. Where what is imitated is clothing that is characteristic of the kuffaar, not things that are worn by others too or things that used to be distinct to them but have now become widespread among other groups too - like the jeans referred to in the question. 2. When the act of imitation happens at a time when the clothing in question is characteristic of the kuffaar. This is because al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) saw some people wearing shawl-like garments over their heads and shoulders, and said, \"They look like the Jews of Khaybar.\" Ibn Hajar commented: \"This could be used as evidence that this kind of garment was characteristic of the Jews at that time, but this is no longer the case, so that garment is now counted as something that is in general permitted.\" (Fath al-Baari, 10/275). The scholars also made an exception concerning Muslims wearing the distinctive clothes of the kuffaar when living in daar al-harb (non-Muslim countries which are at war with Muslims) or for purposes which will benefit the Muslims. Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: \"When a Muslim is living in a non-Muslim land (whether or not it is hostile to Islam), he is not expected to differ from them (the kuffaar) in his outward appearance, because of the harm that may result (from dressing as a Muslim). It is preferable, even obligatory, for a man to look like them sometimes, if that will achieve some religious purpose such as calling them to Islam, finding out their secrets in order to tell the Muslims about them, repelling their harm from the Muslims, and other worthwhile aims. But in the Muslim lands where Allaah has caused His religion to prevail, and where the kuffaar are in an inferior position and are paying jizyah (taxes paid by non-Muslims living under an Islamic government), it is obligatory for Muslims to look different from the kuffaar.\" (Iqtidaa' al-Siraat al-Mustaqeem, 1/418). It is clear from the above that jeans are not clothes that are characteristic of the kuffaar or worn only by them, so they are not haraam. However, it is more befitting for the Muslim to try to wear distinctive Islamic dress wherever he is, in obedience to the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Muslim should feel in his heart that he hates the kuffaar and the way they look and behave. This hatred will motivate him to avoid looking like them at all in the way he dresses or in other ways. Do you not see that a person who despises a people or tribe, or people from a certain country, will hate to dress like them, especially if they are poor. As Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah) said: \"Looking like them in external appearance indicates that one loves them in one's heart, and vice versa.\" And Allaah knows best.\n",

Origin of jinn Types of jinn in Islam The jinn and the sons of Adam The powers of the jinn Food and drink of the jinn The beasts of the jinn The dwelling-places of the jinn Some jinn are Muslims and some are unbelievers Their reckoning on the Day of Resurrection Protection from the harm of the jinn Praise be to Allah.What are jinn? The Quran and Sunnah indicate that the jinn exist, and that there is a purpose for their existence in this life, which is to worship Allah Alone, with no partner or associate. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): And I (Allah) created not the jinn and humans, except that they should worship Me (Alone). [al-Dhariyat 51:56]. O assembly of jinn and mankind! Did there not come to you messengers from amongst you, reciting unto you My Verses? [al-An'am 6:130] The world of the jinn is an independent and separate world, with its own distinct nature and features that are hidden from the world of humans. The jinn and humans have some things in common, such as the possession of understanding and the choice between the way of good and the way of evil. The word jinn comes from an Arabic root meaning hidden from sight. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily he [Shaytan] and qabiluhu [his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe] see you from where you cannot see them [al-A'raf 7:27] Origin of jinn Allah has told us in His Book the essence from which the jinn were created. He says (interpretation of the meaning): And the jinn, We created aforetime from the smokeless flame of fire. [al-Hijr 15:27] And the jinns did He create from a smokeless flame of fire. [al-Rahmaan 55:15]. According to a hadith narrated by ‘Aishah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The angels were created from light, the jinn were created from fire, and Adam was created from that which has been described to you. (Reported by Muslim, 5314) Types of jinn in Islam Allah has created different types of jinn. Among them are some who can take on different forms, such as dogs and snakes; some who are like flying winds with wings; and some who can travel and rest. Abu Tha'labah al-Khushani said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The jinn are of three types: a type that has wings, and they fly through the air; a type that looks like snakes and dogs; and a type that stops for a rest then resumes its journey. (Reported by al-Tahawi in Mushkil al-Athar, 4/95, and by al-Tabarani in al-Kabir, 22/214. Shaykh al-Albani said in al-Mishkat (2/1206, no. 4148): al-Tahawi and Abul-Shaykh reported it with a sahih isnad) The jinn and the sons of Adam Every individual among the sons of Adam has a jinn who has been appointed to be his constant companion (qarin). Ibn Mas’ud said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, There is not one of you who does not have a jinni appointed to be his constant companion. They said, And you too, O Messenger of Allah? He said, Me too, but Allah has helped me and he has submitted, so that he only helps me to do good. (Reported by Muslim, 2814) Al-Nawawi said in his commentary on Muslim (17/175): “He has submitted: he became a believing Muslim. This is the apparent meaning. Al-Qadi said: Know that the ummah is agreed upon the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was protected from Shaytan, physically and mentally, and with regard to his speech. This hadith contains a reference to the warning against the fitnah (temptation, trial) and whispers of the qarin (constant companion from among the jinn). We know that he is with us so we should beware of him as much as possible.” The powers of the jinn Allah has given the jinn powers that he has not given to humans. Allah has told us about some of their powers, such as the ability to move and travel quickly. An ‘ifreet from among the jinn guaranteed to the Prophet Sulayman (peace be upon him) that he would bring the throne of the Queen of Yemen to Jerusalem in a moment faster than that needed for a man to get up from where he was sitting. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): An ‘ifreet (strong one) from the jinn said: I will bring it [her throne] to you before you rise from your place (council). And verily, I am indeed strong, and trustworthy for such work. One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye! Then when Sulayman saw it placed before him, he said, This is by the Grace of my Lord [al-Naml 27:39-40]. Food and drink of the jinn The jinn eat and drink. Ibn Mas’ud said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Someone from among the jinn called me, and I went with him and recited the Quran for them. He took us and showed us the traces of where they had been and the traces of their fires. They asked him for food and he said, You can have every bone on which the name of Allah has been mentioned that comes into your possession, as meat, and all the droppings as food for your animals. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, So do not use [these things] for cleaning yourselves [after relieving oneself], for they are the food and provision of your brothers. (Reported by Muslim, 450). According to another report: A delegation of jinn from Nasibin came to me, and what good jinn they are! They asked me for food and I prayed to Allah for them, so that they would not pass by bones or droppings, but they would find food on them. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3571). The believing jinn may eat any bone on which the name of Allah has been mentioned, because the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not permit them to have anything on which Allah's name has not been mentioned; those are for the kuffar among the jinn. The beasts of the jinn According to the hadith narrated by Ibn Mas’ud, that we have quoted above, the jinn asked the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for provision, and he said to them: and [you can have] all the droppings as food for your animals. The dwelling-places of the jinn The jinn live on this earth where we do. They are mostly to be found in ruins and unclean places like bathrooms, dunghills, garbage dumps and graveyards. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us to take precautions when entering such places, by reciting the adhkar (words of remembrance) prescribed in Islam. One of these was reported by Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered the toilet, he would say, Allahumma innee a'udhu bika min al-khubuthi wal-khabaith (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the evil ones, male and female). (Reported by al-Bukhari, 142; and Muslim, 375). Al-Khattabi explained that khubuth is the plural of khabith (evil or dirty masculine form), and khabaith is the plural of khabithah (evil or dirty feminine form), and that what is meant is male and female shayatin. Some jinn are Muslims and some are unbelievers Allah tells us that some of the jinn said (interpretation of the meaning): And some of us are Muslims, and some of us are al-qasitun (disbelievers those who have deviated from the Right Path). And whosoever has embraced Islam, then such have sought the Right Path. And as for the qasitun, they shall be firewood for Hell. [al-Jinn 72:14-15] The Muslims among the jinn are of different levels as regards righteousness and taqwa. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): [Some jinn said:] There are among us some that are righteous, and some the contrary; we are groups, each having a different way (religious sects, etc.) [al-Jinn 72:11] The story of how the first jinn of this ummah became Muslim was narrated by Abd-Allah ibn Abbas, who said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out with a group of his Companions heading for the marketplace of Ukaz. This was when the shayatهn were prevented from getting any news from heaven, and shooting stars had been sent against them. The shayatهn went back to their people, who said, What is the matter with you? They said, We cannot get news from heaven, and shooting stars were sent against us. Their people said, Nothing is stopping you from hearing news from heaven except some new event that must have happened. Go and look in the east and the west of the earth, and see if you can find out what it is that is stopping you from hearing news from heaven. Those who went out in the direction of Tihamah came upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in Nakhlah, when he was on his way to Ukaz, and found him leading his Companions in Fajr prayer. When they heard the Quran, they listened to it and said, By Allah, this is what is stopping us from hearing news from heaven. When they went back to their people, they said, O our people, we have heard a wonderful Recital (the Quran). It guides to the Right Path, and we have believed therein, and we shall never join (in worship) anything with our Lord (Allah). [al-Jinn 72:2 interpretation of the meaning]. Then Allah revealed to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) the words (interpretation of the meaning): Say (O Muhammad): It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened (to this Quran) [al-Jinn 72:1], and Allah revealed to him what the jinn had said. (reported by al-Bukhari, 731). Their reckoning on the Day of Resurrection The jinn will be called to account on the day of Resurrection . Mujahid (may Allah have mercy on him) said, concerning the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): but the jinn know well that they have indeed to appear (before Him) (i.e., they will be brought to account) [al-Saffat 37:158]: They will be brought to judgement. Sahih al-Bukhari, Bab Dhikr al-Jinn wa Thawabihim wa Iqabihim. Protection from the harm of the jinn Because the jinn can see us while we cannot see them , the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us many ways to protect ourselves from their harm , such as seeking refuge with Allah from the accursed Shaytan, reciting Surat al-Falaq and Surat al-Nas (the last two Surahs of the Quran), and reciting the words taught by Allah in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): Say: My Lord! I seek refuge with You from the whisperings (suggestions) of the shayatin (devils). And I seek refuge with You, my Lord, lest they may attend (or come near) me. [al-Muminun 23:97-98] Saying Bismillah (in the Name of Allah) before entering ones home, before eating or drinking, and before having intercourse will also keep the Shaytan from entering the house or partaking with a person in his food, drink and sexual activity. Similarly, mentioning the name of Allah before entering the toilet or taking off one's clothes will prevent the jinn from seeing a person's ‘awrah or harming him, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, To put a barrier that will prevent the jinn from seeing the ‘awrah of the sons of Adam, let anyone of you say Bismillah when entering the toilet. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 551; Sahih al-Jam’i, 3611). Strength of faith and religion in general will also prevent the jinn from harming a person, so much so that if they were to fight, the one who has faith would win. Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: A man from among the Companions of Muhammad met a man from among the jinn. They wrestled, and the human knocked down the jinni. The human said to him, You look small and skinny to me, and your forearms look like the front paws of a dog. Do all the jinn look like this, or only you? He said, No, by Allah, among them I am strong, but let us wrestle again, and if you defeat me I will teach you something that will do you good. The human said, Fine. He said, Recite, Allah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever-living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists [Ayat al-Kursi al-Baqarah 2:255 interpretation of the meaning]. The human said, Fine. He said, You will never recite this in your house but the Shaytan will come out of it like a donkey breaking wind, and he will never come back in until the next morning. (Reported by al-Darimi, 3247) This is a brief summary about the jinn, and their nature and characteristics. Allah is the Best of protectors and the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.

      "Contents Related Dhikr after Salah (prayer) Dhkir before sleeping How to count tasbih with fingers Praise be to Allah.Dhikr after Salah (prayer) The dhikr after salah referred to in the question has been reported in a hadith reported by Abu Hurayrah from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Whoever glorifies Allah (says Subhan Allah ) thirty-three times immediately after each prayer, and praises Allah (says Al-hamdu Lillah) thirty-three times, and magnifies Allah (says Allahu akbar) thirty-three times, this makes ninety-nine, then to complete one hundred says La ilaha ill-Allah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa ‘ala kulli shayin qadir (There is no god except Allah Alone, with no partner, His is the power and His is the praise, and He is Able to do all things) his sins will be forgiven even if they are like the foam of the sea.” (Reported by Muslim, 939). A number of different descriptions of the dhikr after salah have been narrated, an example of which has been referred to in the question. The evidence for this is the hadith of Abd-Allah ibn Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: There are two qualities, no Muslim man acquires them but he will enter Paradise, and they are simple and easy. He should glorify Allah (say Subhan Allah) ten times immediately after each prayer, and praise Him (say Al-hamdu Lillah) ten times and magnify Him (say Allahu akbar) ten times. I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting this on his fingers. He said: That makes one hundred and fifty on the tongue, and one thousand five hundred (hasanat) in the scales. [Translator's note: each of three phrases repeated ten times makes thirty; multiplied by the number of daily prayers, which is five, makes one hundred and fifty. Each of these good deeds of the tongue will be rewarded with ten hasanat which will be added to the total of good deeds to be weighed in the balance or scales on the Day of Judgement]. When you go to bed, glorify Him and praise Him and magnify Him one hundred times: that will be one hundred on the tongue and a thousand in the scales. Who among you does two thousand and five hundred sayyiat (bad deeds) in one day? They said: How could we not count (our sins)? He said: The Shaytan comes to any one of you whilst he is praying and says, Remember this, remember that, until he finishes his prayer and does not do (this dhikr), or he comes to him when he is lying down and makes him sleepy, until he falls asleep (without doing this dhikr). (Abu ‘Isa said: This is a hasan sahih hadith. Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 3332). Dhkir before sleeping Among the adhkar that may be recited before going to sleep, as referred to in the question, is that reported in the hadith of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that Fatimah (upon whom be peace) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him for a servant. He said, “Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than that? When you go to sleep, say Subhan Allah thirty-three times, Al-hamdu Lillah thirty-three times, and Allahu akbar thirty four times.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4943) How to count tasbih with fingers As regards counting this tasbih , the Sunnah is to use the fingers of the right hand, although it is permitted to use the left hand. The evidence that the right hand is preferable was reported by Abu Dawud (may Allah have mercy on him), who said: ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn ‘Umar ibn Maysarah and Muhammad ibn Qudamah, among others, told us: Aththam told us from al-A’mash from ‘Ata ibn al-Saib from his father from Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr who said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting the tasbih. Ibn Qudamah said: With his right hand. (Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitab al-Salah, Bab al-Tasbih bil-hasa) It was said in Hashiyat at-Tahtawi: “It is correct that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count the tasbih on his right hand. It was reported that he said: Count with your finger tips, for they will be asked and they will be made to speak. Ibn Hijr said: Counting the tasbih with the fingertips is better than using the subhah (prayer-beads or rosary).” The sunnah is to count with the fingertips by putting them on the palm of the hand. As to precisely which finger of the right hand one should start with, I have no specific information on this. And Allah knows best.\n",

As for continuing to deal in riba, this is not permissible, because it is one of the major sins (kabaa’ir), and taking it is tantamount to challenging Allaah and His Messenger, even if one is dealing in riba in order to give it to the poor.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Giving talaaq (divorce) three times at once is bid’ah, and goes against the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “… When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘iddah (prescribed periods)…” [al-Talaaq 65:1]. If a Muslim wants to divorce his wife, he should divorce her according to the Sunnah, which is to give one talaaq at a time when his wife is taahir (not menstruating) and he has not yet had intercourse with her following her period, or when it is clear that she is pregnant. According to the Shaafi’i madhhab and the majority of other madhhabs, giving three talaaqs at once counts as three separate talaaqs and is irrevocable, and the couple cannot remarry until the woman has been married to and divorced from another man. Other scholars say that three talaaqs given at once count as only one talaaq. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Mahr in Islam Evidence for the permissibility of taking the mahr Can the father take the mahr without the wife’s approval? Can the wife forgo any part of the mahr? Praise be to Allah.Mahr in Islam Mahr is one of the rights of the wife, which is hers to take in total and is lawful for her, in contrast to the widespread practice in some countries, where the wife is given no dowry. Evidence for the permissibility of taking the mahr Evidence that the wife must be given her dowry is found in many places, for example the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And give to the women (whom you marry) their mahr (obligatory bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart…” [al-Nisa 4:4] Ibn 'Abbas said: “This refers to the mahr (dowry).” Ibn Kathir, may Allah have mercy on him, said, summarizing the comments of the mufassirin on this verse: “The man must definitely pay the dowry to the woman, and he should not resent it.” Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “But if you intend to replace a wife by another and you have given one of them a cantar (of gold, i.e., a great amount) as mahr, take not the least bit of it back; would you take it wrongfully without a right and (with) a manifest sin? And how could you take it (back) when you have gone in unto each other, and they have taken from you a firm and strong covenant?” [al-Nisa 4:20-21] Ibn Kathir, may Allah have mercy on him, said: “This means: if any one of you wants to divorce his wife and replace her with another, you should not take anything from what you have already given the first wife, even if it was a huge amount of wealth. The mahr is given in exchange for the right to enjoy marital relations. For this reason Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And how could you take it (back) when you have gone in unto each other…?” The “firm and strong covenant” is the marriage contract. Anas ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn ‘Awf came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and there were traces of yellow (perfume) on him. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him about it, and he told him that he had just married a woman of the Ansar. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, “How much did you give her?” He said: “Gold equal to the weight of one date stone.” The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Give a walimah (wedding feast) even if only with one sheep.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4756) Can the father take the mahr without the wife’s approval? The mahr is the right of the wife, and it is not permitted for her father or anyone else to take it except with her approval. Abu Salih said: “When a man married off his daughter, he would take her mahr away from her, but Allah forbade them to do that, and gave women the right to the mahr they received.” (Tafsir Ibn Kathir) Can the wife forgo any part of the mahr? Similarly, if the wife foregoes any part of the mahr , the husband is permitted to take it, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allah has made it lawful).” [al-Nisa 4:4] For more about mahr, please see these answers: 10525 , 94880 , 93780 , 185602 , and 102507 .

      "Praise be to Allah.A Muslim man is permitted to marry anyone he likes of the women whom Allaah has allowed him to marry, but he is encouraged to marry a Muslim woman who is religious and has a good moral character (because this is the basis of true happiness). Similarly, he is permitted to marry a chaste woman of the People of the Book, i.e., Jews and Christians. Another basis for a happy marriage is that his parents should be pleased with his choice of bride, and part of the way in which parents show their love and kindness towards their son is by helping him to get married, whether financially or in other ways. As regards what you say about striving and fighting for the sake of love, we should stop and think about this matter carefully. We believe that feeling love for a particular woman is not the be-all and end-all in a Muslim’s life, for which he should give up everything that matters to him. No way! The Muslim is wise and pays attention to everything that is in his interests, such as the woman’s religious commitment and moral character, his parents’ approval, his own honour and reputation among people, the future of the marriage and its potential to endure, whether any bad things will result from his marriage to a particular woman and whether this outweighs his interests, the environment in which the children of the marriage will grow up, the nature of his future in-laws with whom he will have to mix, etc. It is not the matter of a fleeting desire, rather it is the matter of one’s future and eventual destiny. Finally, we say that the love of a woman is not some god to be worshipped, rather it is a matter that is governed by the laws of the One God, Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Being truthful means speaking the truth and also saying things that reflect reality. Being truthful is one of the necessities of a human society, one of the virtues of human behaviour, and brings great benefits, whilst lying is one of the major elements of corruption in human society, and the cause of the destruction of social structure and ties, one of the most evil features of bad conduct, and causes widespread harm. Hence Islam commanded truthfulness and forbade lying. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah, and be with those who are true (in word and deeds). [al-Tawbah 9:119] Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said (2/414): It means: be truthful and adhere to truthfulness, and you will be among its people and will be saved from calamity, and this will make a way out for you from your problems. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): if they had been true to Allaah, it would have been better for them. [Muhammad 47:21] Abd-Allaah ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: You must be truthful, for truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise. A man will keep speaking the truth and striving to speak the truth until he will be recorded with Allaah as a siddeeq (speaker of the truth). Beware of telling lies, for lying leads to immorality and immorality leads to Hellfire. A man will keep telling lies and striving to tell lies until he is recorded with Allaah as a liar. (Reported by Muslim, 4721) This hadeeth indicates that truthfulness leads to righteousness (al-birr), an all-embracing concept that includes all kinds of goodness and different kinds of righteous deeds. Immorality is basically an inclination towards deviation from the truth, and the immoral person (faajir) is one who is inclined to turn away from the path of guidance. Hence immorality and righteousness are diametrically opposed. Al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: I memorized from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Leave that which makes you doubt for that which does not make you doubt, for truthfulness is certainty and tranquillity, whilst lying is doubt and confusion. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2520; al-Nisaa'i, 8/327; and Ahmad, 1/200) In the lengthy hadeeth of Abu Sufyaan describing his meeting with Heraclius, Abu Sufyaan (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: [Heraclius] said, What does he [meaning the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him] command you to do? I said, He says: worship Allaah alone and do not associate anything in worship with Him, and abandon that which your forefathers did. He commands us to pray, to be truthful, to be chaste and to uphold the ties of kinship. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1/30 and Muslim, 1773). Hakeem ibn Hizaam (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Two parties to a deal have the option of changing their minds until they part; if they are open and honest, their deal will be blessed, and if they conceal and tell lies, the blessing of their deal will be diminished. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4/275 and Muslim, 1532.) Truthfulness includes being truthful towards Allaah by worshipping Him sincerely; being truthful towards ones own soul by making it adhere to the laws of Allaah; and being truthful with people in one's words and by keeping one's promises, and in dealings such as buying, selling and marriage, so there should be no deceiving, cheating, falsifying or withholding of information. Thus a person should be the same on the inside and the outside. As regards lying, it is highly forbidden, and is of varying degrees of abhorrence and sin. The most obnoxious form of lying is falsely attributing things to Allaah and His Messenger, because this involves fabrication about the religion and is an act of outrage against Allaah. Hence one of the characteristics of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is that he truthfully conveyed that which Allaah commanded him to convey. So Allaah said (interpretation of the meanings): who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allaah, to lead mankind astray without knowledge. Certainly Allaah guides not the people whi are zaalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.) [al-Anam 6:144] And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allaah? Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, These are the ones who lied against their Lord! No doubt! The curse of Allaah is on the zaalimoon (polytheists, wrong-doers, oppressors, etc.). [Hood 11:18] Equally bad is lying about the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as he is reported to have said in the mutawaatir hadeeth: Whoever lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell. (Agreed upon). The basic rule with regard to lying is that it is not permitted, but there are certain circumstances in which Islam permits lying to serve a greater purpose or to prevent harm. One of these situations is when a person mediates between two disputing parties in order to reconcile between them, if reconciliation cannot be achieved in any other way. Um Kalthoom (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: He is not a liar who reconciles between people and conveys something good or says something good. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2495). Another example is a mans speaking to his wife, or a woman speaking to her husband, with regard to matters that will strengthen the ties of love between them, even if that is accompanied by exaggeration. Asma bint Yazeed said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Lying is not permitted except in three cases: a mans speaking to his wife to make her happy; lying at times of war; and lying in order to reconcile between people. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1862; he said: it is a hasan hadeeth. See also Saheeh Muslim, 4717). One of the most important forms of both being truthful and lying is in the area of promises and covenants. Being truthful in promises and covenants is one of the characteristics by which the believers are known. Both promises and covenants involve saying something about an issue to confirm that you will do it, especially with regard to one's duties towards Allaah. Allaah says, praising some of His slaves (interpretation of the meanings): Those who are faithfully true to their amaanaat (all the duties which Allaah has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts, etc.) and to their covenants. [al-Muminoon 23:8] and who fulfil their covenant when they make it [al-Baqarah 2:177] Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allaah [i.e., they have gone out for jihad (holy fighting), and showed not their backs to the disbelievers], of them some have fulfilled their obligations (i.e., have been martyred), and some of them are still waiting, but they have never changed [i.e., they never proved treacherous to their covenant which they concluded with Allaah] in the least. [al-Ahzaab 33:23] We ask Allaah to make us sincere and truthful in word and deed. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Yes, there are benefits of circumcision insofar as it is part of the sunan (ways) of the Prophets and is part of the sunan al-fitrah (acts that befit the natural state of man). It is cleaner and healthier in terms of urination and intercourse, and prevents infection, etc. These and other benefits far outweigh the pain caused, which is less for infants than for adults. Moreover, a number of the scholars have said that circumcision is obligatory for males. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni: Circumcision is an obligation for men and an honour, not an obligation, for women. This is the opinion of a number of scholars. Ahmad said: It is more of an obligation for men, because if a man is not circumcised, this piece of skin will be dangling down over the head of the penis and it will be too difficult to clean left-over urine properly. It is not so strict in the case of women. Abu Abd-Allaah said: Ibn Abbaas used to be very strict in this matter, and it is reported that he said that no Hajj or salaah would be accepted, i.e., from the one who is not circumcised. Al-Hasan was more lenient; he said: If a person enters Islam, it is not essential for him to be circumcised. And he said: Black and white people embraced Islam, but not one of them was checked or forced to get circumcised. The evidence that it is obligatory is the fact that covering the awrah (private parts) is obligatory, so if circumcision were not obligatory, it would not be permissible for the one who wants to be circumcised to uncover his awrah for this purpose. Circumcision is one of the signs of a Muslim, and like the other signs, it is obligatory. If an adult male embraces Islam and is afraid that circumcision would be harmful for him, then he is excused, because a person may be excused from ghusl, wudoo, etc., if he fears that they may be harmful for him, so it is more so in the case of circumcision. If a person is confident that it will not be harmful, then he has to do it. Hanbal said: I asked Abu Abd-Allaah about the Dhimmi (non-Muslim under Islamic rule) who embraces Islam: did he think that he should be circumcised? He said: There is no alternative to that (i.e. he has to). I asked: what if he or she is advanced in age? He said: It is better for him to be circumcised, because of the hadeeth: Ibraaheem was circumcised when he was eighty years old, and Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): it is the religion of your father Ibraaheem [al-Hajj 22:78] So our advice to you is to go ahead and have your son circumcised by someone who is skilled and experienced. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Five things are part of the fitrah: circumcision, removing the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, and plucking the armpit hair. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5441) May Allaah help us and you to do good.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This is one of the issues on which the scholars (may Allaah have mercy on them) have differed. Some of them think that placing the right hand on the left forearm when standing up from rukoo is sunnah mustahabbah (preferable) because of the general meaning of the hadeeth of Sahl ibn Sad al-Saaidi (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: The people were told that a man should place his right hand on his left forearm in prayer. They said: the general meaning of the phrase in prayer makes it clear that when standing up from rukoo, one should place ones hands thus, because the qiyaam (standing) includes the standing both before rukoo and after, so a person should place his right hand on his left forearm in both qiyaams. They said that during rukoo, the hands should be on the knees, in sujood they should be on the ground, in juloos (sitting) they should be on the thighs, and in qiyaam (standing) they should be on the chest. This is where the hands should be during the qiyaam before rukoo and after. The attitude of humility and proper conduct before the Lord requires this in both qiyaams, and this position is the furthest away from fidgeting. Other scholars think that the right hand does not have to be placed on the left forearm after standing up from rukoo, and their evidence is the fact that no specific report on this matter has been narrated, as well as the fact that the general meaning of qiyaam does not include standing up from rukoo, because this is a straightening of the back, not a standing (qiyaam), so the person should let his hands drop to his sides. Some scholars say that a person has the choice of placing his hands on his chest or not, because nothing clear has been reported in the Sunnah on this point. This is the opinion of Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him. The first opinion is more likely to be correct, in sha Allaah, but in any case, either way is valid. Differences in such matters should not lead to reprehensible disputes and conflict, or accusations of bidah if someone does this, or of neglecting the Sunnah if he does not. Such comments can only be made in cases where there is a clear saheeh text and definite evidence. For more information on this matter, see: Al-Furoo by Ibn Muflih, 1/433; al-Insaaf by al-Mirdaawi, 2/63; Sharh Muntaha al-Iraadaat, 1/185; al-Sharh al-Mumti by Ibn Uthaymeen, 3/146. The hadeeth scholar Shaykh Badee al-Deen al-Sindi wrote a paper specifically on this topic in which he supported the opinion that it is sunnah to place the right hand on the left forearm after standing up from rukoo: Ziyaadat al-Khushoo bi wad al-Yumna alal-Yusra bad al-Rukoo. Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz also wrote a paper on this topic, in which he supported the idea of putting the hands on the chest after standing up from rukoo. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Before answering this question, we should advise you of the importance of wisdom in denouncing evil, and of being careful not to inadvertantly promote anti-Islamic websites so that everyone will go and read them, because this will indirectly contribute to the promotion of these worthless people who claim to imitate the Qur’aan. Producing anything like the Qur’aan is impossible, because Allaah challenged anyone to do this. This challenge was issued to the most brilliant and eloquent Arab poets at the time when the Qur’aan was revealed, which was also the time when Arabic eloquence was at its peak. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): “Let them then produce a recital like unto it (the Qur’aan) if they are truthful.” [al-Tur 52:34] When they could not do this, Allaah challenged them to produce ten soorahs like its soorahs: “Or they say: ‘He (Muhammad) forged it (the Qur’aan).’ Say: ‘Bring you then ten forged soorahs (chapters) like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah (to your help), if you speak the truth!’” [Hud 11:13 – interpretation of the meaning]. When they could not do this, Allah challenged them to produce just one soorah that contained the same eloquence and wisdom as the Qur’aan. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Or do they say: ‘He (Muhammad) has forged it’? Say: ‘Bring then a soorah (chapter) like unto it, and call upon whomsoever you like, besides Allah, if you are truthful!” [Yoonus 10:38] Allah called on them to seek help from whoever they wanted, and to accept the challenge. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.” [al-Baqarah 2:23] When they were unable to do this, Allah informed them that they would never be able to do it, no matter who they called upon to help them. He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: ‘If mankind and jinn were together to produce the like of this Qur’aan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.’” [al-Isra’ 17:88] There is no one except Allah who can produce the like of the Qur’aan, because the Qur’aan, as He says, is “a Book, the Verses whereof are perfected and then explained in detail from One Who is All-Wise and Well-Acquainted (with all things).” [Hud 11:1 – interpretation of the meaning]. When some liars did try to imitate the Qur’aan they came up with ridicualous nonsense that would make children laugh, let alone mature and intelligent adults. For example, the liar Musaylimah said: “O frog, daughter of two frogs, croak as much as you want, your upper part is in the water and your lower part is in the mud.” This is an example of the kind of thing said by him and other pretenders to Prophethood. (See Sayd al-Khaatir by Ibn al-Jawzi, p. 404). Some forms of falsehood may deceive some of the people because of their ignorance and lack of understanding of the rules of grammar and accepted styles of eloquence in Arabic. But anyone who has intelligence and common sense should at least be able to see the difference and realize that these made-up words cannot possibly be Qur’aan. If we look at the Website referred to in the question, we see that kufr is quite clearly mentioned in these fabricated soorahs, such as the statement that the Messiah is the son of God or is God, and the promotion of the evil madhhab of Raafidah (a kind of Shi’ah), and other such nonsense. There are also some weird contradictions, for example, these liars say in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah al-tajassud”: “Exalted be He above taking any of His creation as a son,” but then we find in the so-called ninth aayah of the so-called “soorah al-eemaan” the words: “You are he, the son of God, truly; in you we believe.” But verily Allah has spoken the truth when He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.” [al-Nisaa’ 4:82] You also find other silly comments in these made-up soorahs, such as the claim that Allah permitted His Prophet to change whatever he wanted in the Qur’aan, as in the so-called sixth aayah of the so-called “soorah al-wasaaya”: “Abrogate whatever you want to abrogate of the commands that We have given you, for We permit you to make changes to Our decisions”! Every Muslim will realize the extent of the lies contained in these words that come from this mind that is driven by ulterior motives. Have you ever seen anything more foolish than these words? Allah has told us to adhere to His Book and put it into practice, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And this is a blessed Book which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allah, that you may receive mercy.” [al-An’aam 6:155] He commanded His Messenger to adhere to the Qur’aan, saying (interpretation of the meaning): “So hold you (Muhammad) to that which is inspired in you. Verily, you are on a Straight Path.” [al-Zukhruf 43:43]. Allah warned His Messenger not to fail in conveying the message complete and unaltered, as He said (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, they were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad), to fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you for a friend! And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little. In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion (of punishment) in this life and a double portion (of punishment) after death. And then you would have found none to help you against Us” [al-Isra’ 17:73-75] and “… if he (Muhammad) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah), We surely should have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might), and then certainly should have cut off his life artery (aorta)” [al-Haaqqah 69:44-46]. Having said all this, how can there be any so-called soorah that says the messenger has the right to abrogate whatever he wants in the Qur’aan and that he has the authority to change or omit whatever rules he wants?? The only One Who can abrogate whatever He wants of the Qur’aan is the One Who revealed it, may He be glorified, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah blots out what He wills and confirms (what He wills). And with Him is the Mother of the Book” [al-Ra’d 13:39]; “Whatever a Verse (revelation) We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allah is able to do all things?” [al-Baqarah 2:106]. We, like our Messenger, are obliged to understand and implement the Qur’aan without distorting, omitting or changing anything. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): “(This is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.” [Saad 38:29]. We have seen in the false soorahs quoted on that Internet website a real example of what is referred to in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say: ‘This is from Allah,’ but it is not from Allah; and they speak a lie against Allah while they know it.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:78]. We ask Allah to make His Religion and His Book prevail and to make His friends victorious, as We ask Him to defeat and humiliate His enemies and cause them to fail. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The strength of love for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is connected to the Muslim’s faith. When his faith increases, his love for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) increases. Loving the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is an act of obedience to Allaah and a means of drawing closer to Him. Loving the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is one of the obligatory duties in Islam. It was narrated that Anas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his father, his child and all the people.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 15; Muslim, 44) You can increase your love of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by realizing the following: Firstly: he was sent by his Lord who chose him above all of creation to convey the religion of Allaah to mankind. Allaah chose him because He loved him and was pleased with him. If Allaah were not pleased with him, He would not have chosen him. So we must love the one whom Allaah loves and be pleased with the one with whom Allaah is pleased. We must realize that he is the close friend (khaleel) of Allaah and that close friendship is a higher status and it is the highest degree of love. It was narrated that Jundub said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “I declare before Allaah that I have no close friend (khaleel) from among you. Allaah has taken me as a close friend as he took Ibraaheem as a close friend. If I were to have taken a close friend from among my ummah, I would have taken Abu Bakr as a close friend.” (Narrated by Muslim, 532). Secondly: We should realize the high status to which Allaah has raised him, for he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the best of mankind. It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I will be the leader of mankind of the Day of Resurrection, the first whose grave will be opened, the first to intercede and the first to be asked to intercede.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2278) Thirdly: We should realize that he suffered trials and difficulties in order to bring Islam to us. We should remember that the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was persecuted, hit, slandered and insulted; the closest people to him disowned him and accused him of being a madman, a liar and a sorcerer. He fought the people in order to protect the religion so that it could reach us; they fought him, expelled him from his people and homeland, and gathered armies against him. Fourthly: We should follow the example of his companions who loved him deeply. They loved him more than wealth and sons, and more than their own selves. There follow some examples of that: It was narrated that Anas said: I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when the barber was cutting his hair and his companions were going around him wanting to ensure that his hair would fall only into someone’s hand. Narrated by Muslim, 2325 It was narrated that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “On the Day of Uhud some of the people fled and left the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), but Abu Talhah stood before him covering him with a shield. Abu Talhah was a powerful archer who broke two or three bows that day. When a man passed by carrying a quiver containing arrows, he would say: Give them to Abu Talhah. Whenever the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) raised his head to look at the people, Abu Talhah would say: O Prophet of Allaah, may my father and my mother be sacrificed for you, do not raise your head lest you be struck by an arrow shot by the enemy. My neck is before your neck.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3600; Muslim, 1811) Fifthly: You should follow his Sunnah in word and deed, so that his Sunnah is the path you follow in your whole life, and you put his words before any other words and put his command before everything else; and you should follow the ‘aqeedah (belief) of his noble Companions, and the ‘aqeedah of the Taabi’een who followed them, and the ‘aqeedah of those who followed their path until the present day, namely Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah, and avoid bid’ah (innovation), especially the Raafidis (Shi’ah), for their hearts are hardened against the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and they give their imams precedence over him and love them more than they love him. We ask Allaah to help us to love His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and to make him dearer to us than our children, parents, families and our own selves. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Why does the question associate between crime and the holy Qur'aan? The Qur'aan was sent as a mercy for people, as a guidance and light, to guide to truth and righteousness and the Straight Path. No one can believe that any person with religion or any mercy in his heart would split a pregnant woman's belly and take the infant out then kill it; kill children one by one in front of their parents; smash heads with axes; or, burn the living. Only a criminal with a heart harder than a stone which has no mercy, does not know Allaah, and does not believe in the hereafter would do such acts. It is not even possible for a sane person to believe that such a person is a Muslim. This is a fact that can't be hidden even if the person is disguised in Muslim clothing and grows a beard. Furthermore, it is not possible to call the killing of unarmed innocent Muslim villagers Jihaad. A Muslim--even while in Jihaad to establish the word of Allaah and in battle with the armies which stand to stop the spread of the word of Allaah--is absolutely not permitted to mutilate the dead; nor to kill a child; nor to kill a woman unless she bears weapons; nor to burn anyone with fire. For those who want to know what Islam is, they need to learn it from the Qur'aan and the Hadeeth (recorded sayings) of the Prophet , and not through the behavior of criminals and the suspicious.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Generally speaking, medical treatment or seeking a cure is allowed, because of the report of Abu’l-Darda’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Allaah has sent down the disease and the cure, and has made for every disease the cure. So treat sickness, but do not use anything haraam’” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 3376), and the hadeeth of Usaamah ibn Shurayk (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: ‘The Bedouin said, “O Messenger of Allaah, should we not treat sickness?” He said: “Treat sickness, for Allaah has not created any disease except He has also created the cure, except for one disease.” They said, “O Messenger of Allaah, what is it?” He said: “Old age.”’” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 4/383, no. 1961. He said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. See also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2930). The majority of scholars (Hanafi and Maaliki) said that medical treatment is mubaah (permitted). The Shaafi’is, and al-Qaadi, Ibn ‘Aqeel and Ibn al-Jawzi among the Hanbalis, said that it is mustahabb (recommended), because of the hadeeth “Allaah has sent down the disease and the cure, and has made for every disease the cure. So treat sickness, but do not use anything haraam,” and other ahaadeeth which contain instructions to seek cures. They said: the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used cupping and other kinds of treatment indicates that medical treatment is permitted. For the Shaafi’is, treatment is mustahabb when there is no certainty that it will be beneficial, but when treatment is certain to be beneficial (such as putting a dressing on a wound), then it is waajib or obligatory (an example would be blood transfusions in certain cases). (See Haashiyat Ibn ‘Aabideen, 5/215, 249; al-Hidaayah Takmilat Fath al-Qadeer, 8/134; al-Fawaakih al-Dawaani, 2/440; Rawdah al-Taalibeen, 2/96; Kashshaaf al-Qinaa’, 2/76; al-Insaaf, 2/463; al-Aadaab al-Shar’iyyah, 2/359ff, Haashiyat al-Jumal, 2/134). Concerning the saheeh ahaadeeth that speak about medical treatment, Ibn al-Qayyim said: This does not contradict tawaakul (putting one’s trust in Allaah), just as warding off hunger, thirst, heat and cold does not contradict tawakkul. The essence of tawaakul is not complete without resorting to the means which Allaah has set out in order for us to achieve results both according to His decree (qadr) and His laws (shar’). Not using these means is contrary to tawaakul: it goes against and undermines the command and wisdom of Allaah, although the one who neglects the means may think that this makes his tawakkul stronger. Ignoring the means is a sign of helplessness that goes against the true essence of tawakkul, which is that the heart relies on Allaah to bring the slave whatever will benefit him in this world and the next, and to protect him from whatever may harm him in this world and the next. But along with this reliance, it is essential to take the appropriate means, otherwise he will be going against the wisdom and command of Allah. Helplessness should not be taken as a sign of tawaakul, nor should tawakkul make a person helpless. (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 4/15. See al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 11/116) In summary, therefore, seeking a treatment or cure is not obligatory according to the scholars, unless – according to some – it will definitely be of benefit. Since in the situation described in the question there is no certainty that treatment will be of benefit, and indeed it is likely to cause suffering to the patient, then there is nothing at all wrong with not giving the treatment. The patient should not forget to put his trust in Allaah and seek refuge in Him, for the gates of Heaven are open to those who call on Allaah. He may also seek treatment (ruqya) by reciting Qur’aan, such as reading al-Faatihah, al-Falaq and al-Naas over himself. This will benefit him psychologically and physically, as well as bringing him reward. Allaah is the Healer and there is no healer but He.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The teaching of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is to blot out pictures and to destroy statues, because of the hadeeth of Abu’l-Hayyaaj al-Asadi, who said: “ ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib said to me, ‘Shall I not send you with the same instructions that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him] sent me with? Do not leave any statue without eliminating it or any raised grave withour levelling it.” (Reported by Muslim, 1609). So it is OK to break pictures of animate objects and get rid of them. As for the silver-plated vessels, it is not permissible to use them because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The one who drinks from a vessel of silver is gargling fire from Hell into his stomach.” (Reported by Muslim, 3846). The ruling on items that are plated or coated with gold and silver is that same as the ruling on items that are made of gold and silver. With regard to giving away gifts that have been given to you, there is nothing wrong in doing so, because a person takes possession of the gift when he receives it, and he is permitted to dispose of it by selling it, giving it away or giving it to charity and so on.

      "Praise be to Allah.If a person has proposed marriage to a woman, it is not permitted for anyone else to offer a proposal to her, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) which states that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man should offer a proposal of marriage over the proposal of his brother until the first one gives up or gives him permission.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4746). There follow quotations from Ibn Hijr’s commentary which will shed more light on the matter: The majority of scholars said: This amounts to a prohibition… The Shaafi’is and Hanbalis said: it is prohibited when the woman proposed to, or her appointed guardian, has stated that she accepts the offer, but if she has stated that she rejects this offer, it is not prohibited. If the second man does not know the situation, then he is permitted to propose marriage, because the basic principle is that proposing marriage is something permitted… If the woman has not answered either way, it is permitted. Al-Tirmidhi reported from al-Shaafi’i that the meaning of the hadeeth is: if a man proposes to a woman and she likes him and accepts, no-one else should propose to her after that, but if he (the second man) does not know that she liked and accepted that proposal, there is nothing wrong with his proposing to her. The evidence for this is the story of Faatimah bint Qays, who did not tell (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) that she had accepted the proposal of one (of two men who had proposed to her). If she had told him, he would not have advised her to marry someone other than the one she had chosen. If there is no word of acceptance or rejection from the woman, some of the Shaafi’is say that it is definitely permitted… Al-Shaafi’i said that in the case of a virgin, her silence indicates her acceptance of a suitor. The hadeeth was interpretated as meaning that if the first man to propose gives permission to the second, it is no longer prohibited for him to propose. … It was reported from Ibn al-Qaasim, the companion of Maalik, that if the first suitor is immoral, a chaste man is permitted to propose over his proposal. Ibn al-‘Arabi said that this was correct… This is applicable if the woman is chaste, because an immoral man would not be compatible for her, and his proposal would be like no proposal at all. The phrase “until he marries her”* means until the first suitor has gone ahead and married her, so that anyone else will realize that there is no longer any point in proposing; “or gives up” means that the first suitor decides not to go ahead, in which case it is permitted for the second to offer his proposal. * Please note these words are in another Rewaaya…\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The scholars said that leftover water from which a dog has drunk and the saliva of dogs are naajis (unclean, impure), and that vessels and garments licked by a dog must be washed. It is reported in the Sunnah how a Muslim should purify these things if that happens. Al-Bukhaari and Muslim reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him throw away its contents, then wash it seven times. Muslim added: the first time with earth. (Al-Bukhaari bi Haashiyat al-Sindi, 1/44; Muslim, 1/234). The meaning of the word translated here as lick means if a dog puts its tongue into water, or whatever, regardless of whether or not it actually drinks. The hadeeth refers to vessels, but the scholars did not distinguish between vessels and other things in this regard. Al-Iraaqi said: Vessels are mentioned because this is the usual scenario. The vessel or garment must be washed seven times, one of them being with earth. This is the opinion of Ibn Abbaas and Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with them), according to one report. It was also the opinion of Ibn Sirin, Tawus, al-Awza'i, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, Thawr, and others. (Al-Majmoo, 2/586; al-Mughni, 1/46 al-Muhallaa, 1/146; Nayl al-Awtaar, 1/74). It is not the last washing that has to be done with earth, so there is no room for the objection mentioned in the question that this will make the clothes dirty. The clothes will be washed with water (after the washing with earth), and once they are dried and ironed, they will be cleaner than before. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The first difference: qualities Semen in the case of men is a thick, white liquid, and in the case of women it is thin and yellow. (Translators note: the word maniy is used to refer to the fluid secreted by either male or female at the time of orgasm). The source for these descriptions of maniy come from the hadeeth of Umm Sulaym (may Allaah be pleased with her), who asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about a woman who sees a dream like a man sees (i.e., an erotic dream). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If a woman sees that, she should do ghusl. Umm Sulaym said: I felt shy when I heard that. She asked, Is that possible? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: How else would the child resemble his father or mother? The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow. Whichever of the two prevails or comes first decides which parent the child will resemble. (Agreed upon. Saheeh Muslim, 469). In his commentary on Saheeh Muslim (3/222), Imaam al-Nawawi said, concerning the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) The water of the man is thick and white, and the water of the woman is thin and yellow: This is an important criterion in describing maniy. This description applies when a person is healthy, and in most cases. The scholars said: when a man is healthy, his semen is white and thick, and gushes out in spurts accompanied by feelings of pleasure. After it has come out, it is followed immediately by a feeling of being drained and exhausted. Its smell is like that of palm tree pollen, which in turn resembles the smell of dough (the colour of semen may change for a number of reasons, including the following): If a person is sick his semen may become thin and yellow, or his testicles may become slack or soft, with the result that the emission of semen is not accompanied by any feelings of pleasure. If a man engages in intercourse too frequently, his semen may become red and resemble the juice that comes from meat, or may even contain blood [ameet???]. There are three distinguishing features of semen, the presence of any of which is sufficient for it to be classified as semen: firstly, its emission is accompanied by feelings of pleasure and is immediately followed by exhaustion; secondly, it smells like palm tree pollen, as stated above; and thirdly, it gushes out in spurts. Each one of these three characteristics is sufficient for it to be defined as semen; it is not necessary for all three features to be present. If none of them are present, the substance cannot be described as semen and in all likelihood it is not. All of the above applies to the maniy of men; in the case of women, their maniy is thin and yellow, although it could become white if the woman is strong. It has two distinguishing characteristics, either of which is sufficient to class the substance as maniy: firstly, it smells like the maniy of men, and secondly, its emission is accompanied by feelings of pleasure and is immediately followed by exhaustion. Madhiy, on the other hand, is a sticky white fluid that is emitted when a person is thinking of or desiring intercourse. Its emission is not accompanied by feelings of pleasure, it does not gush out in spurts, and it is not followed by exhaustion. This may happen to men and women alike, although it is more common among women. This is the comment of Imaam al-Nawawi in his commentary on Muslim (Sharh Muslim, 3/213). The second difference: what should be done after emission of either type of fluid When maniy is emitted, a person must perform ghusl to clean himself from sexual impurity (janaabah), whether this happened during intercourse or otherwise, whether he was awake or it happened because of an erotic dream. Madhiy, on the other hand, means that a person only needs to do wudoo. The evidence for this is the report of Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I was a man who used to experience a lot of urethral discharge, so I told Miqdaad to ask the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about it. So he asked him, and he said: It requires wudoo. (Agreed upon; this version was narrated by al-Bukhaari). Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/168), Ibn al-Mundhir said: The scholars agree that passing stools or urine, the emission of madhiy or passing wind are all things that invalidate tahaarah (purity) [i.e. they mean that wudoo must be renewed]. The third difference: whether they are taahir (pure) or naajis (impure) Maniy is taahir according to the most correct opinion among the scholars. The evidence for this is the report of Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to wash the maniy (from his clothes) then go out to pray wearing the same clothes, and I could see the spot where he had washed it. (Agreed upon). According to a report narrated by Muslim: I used to rub it (semen) thoroughly from the garment of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he would pray in it. According to another version: I would scratch it from his garment with my nail when it had become dry. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to leave it without washing it when it was wet; it was sufficient just to wipe it with ood (a kind of aromatic wood) or something similar, as was reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad (6/243) from Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to remove maniy from his garment with a twig of adhkhar (a kind of tree), then pray in that garment, and he would rub it from his garment once it was dry, and would pray in the same garment. Ibn Khuzaymah reported it in his Saheeh, and Shaykh al-Albaani classed it as hasan in al-Irwa (1/197). Madhiy (urethral discharge) is naajis (impure), because of the hadeeth of Ali quoted above, in some versions of which it is reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded him to wash his penis and testicles and do wudoo, as was reported by Abu Awaanah in al-Mustakhraj. Ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhees: There is nothing at fault in this isnaad. So madhiy is naajis and the penis and testicles must be washed, as it nullifies tahaarah. Ruling concerning clothing on which there is semen or urethral discharge As maniy is deemed to be taahir, if it gets on a persons clothes it does not make them impure, and if he prays in those clothes there is nothing wrong with that. Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (1/763): Even though we say it is taahir, it is better to rub it, but if one prays (in those clothes) without rubbing it, this is acceptable. In the case of madhiy, it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it, because of the difficulty of doing otherwise. The evidence for this is the hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan from Sahl ibn Haneef, who said: I used to experience a lot of urethral discharge, and I used to do ghusl a lot. I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about it and he said: It is sufficient for you to do wudoo (to purify yourself) from that. I said, O Messenger of Allaah, what about when it gets on my clothes? He said: It is sufficient for you to take a handful of water and sprinkle it on your clothes wherever you think (the madhiy) is. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi. He said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth, and the only other hadeeth about madhiy that we know is the hadeeth of Muhammad ibn Ishaaq). The author of Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi (1/373) said: This may be taken to prove that if madhiy gets on one's clothes, it is sufficient to sprinkle water on it; one does not have to wash it. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.For a man to shake hands with a non-mahram woman (one to whom he is not related) is haraam and is not permitted at all. Among the evidence for this is the hadeeth of Ma’qal ibn Yassaar (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If one of you were to be struck in the head with an iron needle, it would be better for him than if he were to touch a woman he is not allowed to.” (Reported by al-Tabaraani; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5045). There is no doubt that for a man to touch a non-mahram woman is one of the causes of fitnah (turmoil, temptation), provocation of desire and committing haraam deeds. No one should say that their intention is sound or their heart is clean, because the one who was the purest of heart and the most chaste of all, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never touched a non-mahram woman, even when accepting bay’ah (oath of allegiance) from women. He did not hold their hands when accepting their bay’ah, as he did with men; their bay’ah was by words only, as was reported by his wife ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). She said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would test the believing women who emigrated to him with the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “O Prophet! When believeing women come to you to give you the bay’ah (pledge), that they will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, that they will not steal, that they will not commit illegal sexual intercourse, that they will not kill their children, that they will not utter slander, intentionally forging falsehood (i.e., by making illegal children belong to their husbands), and that thye will not disobey you in any ma’ruf (Islamic monotheism and all that which Islam ordains), then accept their bay’ah and ask Allaah to forgive them. Verily Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Mumtahinah 60:12] ‘Aa’ishah said: “So whoever of the believing women agreed to these conditions, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would say to her: ‘I have accepted your bay’ah by words.’ By Allaah, his hand never touched the hand of any woman when accepting their bay’ah; he accepted their bay’ah by saying ‘I have accepted your bay’ah on this basis.’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4512; according to another report: he accepted their bay’ah by words… the hand of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never touched the hand of any woman except a woman he owned . Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6674). Some Muslims feel too embarrassed to refuse when a woman offers her hand to them. In addition to mixing with women, some of them claim that they are forced to shake hands with fellow-students and teachers in schools and universities, or with colleagues in the workplace, or in business meetings and so on, but this is not an acceptable excuse. The Muslim should overcome his own feelings and the promptings of the Shaytaan, and be strong in his faith, because Allaah is not ashamed of the truth. The Muslim could apologize politely and explain that the reason he does not want to shake hands is not to offend or hurt anybody’s feelings, but it is because he is following the teachings of his religion. In most cases this will earn him respect from others. There is no harm done if they find it strange at first, and it may even be a practical opportunity for da’wah. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Since your grandmother has died and gone to her Lord, you cannot know whether she has forgiven you or not. There is no way that you can ask for her forgiveness now that she has died. This confirms the importance of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Whoever has wronged his brother with regard to his honour or something, let him ask him for forgiveness before the time when there will be neither dinar nor dirham, and if he has any good deeds it will be taken from him in proportion to the wrong he did, and if he does not have any good deeds (hasanaat), some of the other person's evil deeds (sayiaat) will be taken and given to him to bear. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2296). Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this hadeeth: Whoever has wronged his brother i.e., if he has done something wrong to his brother. with regard to his honour or something i.e., anything else this includes all kinds of wealth and wounding, even a slap in the face and so on. According to a report narrated by al-Tirmidhi, with regard to his honour or his wealth. Before the time when there will be neither dinar nor dirham i.e., the Day of Resurrection. Some of the other person's evil deeds (sayiaat) will be taken i.e., they will be taken from the account of the person who was wronged and given to him to bear i.e., they will be added to the account of the wrongdoer. Muslim also narrated a hadeeth similar in meaning to this through a different isnaad. This version is clearer in meaning: The one who is bankrupt among my ummah is the one who will come on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting and zakaah to his credit, but he will come having slandered one person and shed the blood of another and wrongfully consumed the wealth of a third, so (his victims) will be given some of his hasanaat (good deeds), and if his hasanaat run out before the score is settled, some of their sins will be taken and thrown onto him, and he will be thrown into Hell. According to a report also narrated by al-Bukhaari from Abu Hurayrah, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever has done wrong to his brother, let him seek his forgiveness, because in the Hereafter there will be no dinar or dirham, and let him ask for his forgiveness before some of his hasanaat are taken and given to his brother, and if he has no hasanaat, some of his brothers sayiaat will be taken and thrown onto him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6053) Abu Naeem reported from Ibn Masood that a person will be taken by the hand and made to stand before all of mankind, and a caller will cry out: This is So and so the son of So and so. Whoever is owed anything by him, let him come forward. So they will come forward, and the Lord will say, Give them what is due to them. He will say, O Lord, the world is finished, so how can I give them anything? He [Allaah] will say to the angels, Take from his righteous deeds and give each one what he is asking for. If he is to be saved and there is even a mustard-seed worth of his hasanaat left over, Allaah will multiply it until He admits him thereby to Paradise. Ahmad and al-Haakim reported from Jaabir from Abd-Allaah ibn Unays, who attributed it to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): No one of the people of Paradise will be allowed to enter Paradise when one of the people of Hell has been wronged by him, until I settle the score, even with regard to a slap in the face. We [the Sahaabah] said: O Messenger of Allaah, how will that be, when we will be gathered barefoot and naked? He said, By virtue of sayiaat and hasanaat. (Fath al-Baari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari). In any case, you have taken a very important step, which is repenting to Allaah. If you sincerely repent to Him and do as much as you can to honour your grandmother (for more details, see Question #763), and she sees in her record (on the Day of Judgement) that you sought forgiveness for her, perhaps she will forgive you on that Day if she had not already forgiven you in this world.

You are still a Muslim, but you have committed an act of disobedience towards Allaah by doing this sinful act, so come back to your Lord and seek His forgiveness for what you have done. Do more good deeds to expiate for and cancel out your bad deeds, do those things that will help you to remain chaste, and hasten to marry according to Islam. Finally, we will leave you with a story from which you may learn a valuable lesson: Ibn Masood reported that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him that he had kissed or touched a woman, or something similar, as if he was asking how he could expiate for this (according to another report: a man had done something with a woman that fell short of actual intercourse. He came to Umar ibn al-Khattaab, who regarded it as something very serious; then he came to Abu Bakr, who regarded it as something very serious. Then he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). Then Allaah revealed the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And perform al-salaah at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e., small sins). That is a reminder (advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice). [Hood 11:114]. The man asked, Is this concerning me, O Messenger of Allaah? He said: It is concerning whoever of my ummah does this. (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his Saheeh, 4963). According to a report narrated by Abd-Allaah, a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, O Messenger of Allaah, I fondled a woman in the furthest outskirts of Madeenah but I did not actually have intercourse with her. Here I am, judge me as you wish. Umar said to him: Allaah had covered you, you should have covered yourself (i.e., you should not have spoken of it). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not reply at all, so the man got up and left. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent a man to follow him, call him and recite to him the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And perform al-salaah at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e., small sins). That is a reminder (advice) for the mindful (those who accept advice). [Hood 11:114].

This is the opinion of Ishaaq, and it was reported that when Masrooq married his daughter off, he put a condition that he would get ten thousand for himself, which he spent on Hajj and on the poor, then he said to the husband: “Provide your wife with what she needs [e.g., buy her clothes and furnish a house for her].” Something similar was reported from ‘Ali ibn al-Husayn.’ ‘Ataa’, Tawoos, ‘Ikrimah, ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez, al-Thawri and Abu ‘Ubayd said: ‘All of the mahr is for the woman… because the mahr must not be given to anyone but the wife, as a compensation for intimacy with her… Our evidence for this is the words of Allaah in the story of Shu’ayb, upon whom be peace (interpretation of the meaning): “He said: ‘I intend to wed one of these two daughters of mine to you, on condition that you serve me for eight years…’” [al-Qasas 28:27] Here the father, Shu’ayb, made his employing Moosa to look after his sheep his dowry, which was a condition that he would get something for himself. Moreover, a father has the right to take from the wealth of his child, on the basis of the Prophet’s words, “You and your wealth belong to your father,” and “Your children are among the best of your earnings, so consume from their wealth.” (Reported by Abu Dawood; a similar report narrated by al-Tirmidhi, who said, a hasan hadeeth). If a father puts the condition that he will get something for himself from the dowry, this means that he will be taking something from his daughter’s wealth, and he has the right to do this… A father has the right to take whatever he wants and leave whatever he wants, and he could take it with this condition or without it… This is provided that he is not unfair in his taking from his daughter’s wealth; if he is being unfair, then the condition is not valid, and the entire dowry belongs to the bride.’ He also said (may Allaah have mercy on him): ‘Section: If any guardian other than the father, such as the grandfather, brother or (paternal) uncle puts such a condition, it is invalid. This is the opinion of Ahmad, and all the mahr agreed upon belongs to the bride.’\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Those who eat riba (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan, leading him to insanity. That is because they say: Trading is only like riba, whereas Allaah has permitted trading and forbidden riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past; his case is for Allaah (to judge); but whoever returns (to riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire they will abide therein. [al-Baqarah 2:275] Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said concerning the phrase So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba shall not be punished for his past: This means: whoever hears that Allaah has forbidden riba should stop as soon as this ruling reaches him, but he can keep whatever he had received before, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Allaah has forgiven what is past [al-Maaidah 5:95]. Similarly, on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: All riba owing from the time of Jaahiliyyah is under these two feet of mine (when he abolished everything that was owed to the usurers except their capital), he did not command them to return the extra money they had received during the time of Jaahiliyyah. (The phrase) (Allaah) has forgiven what is past is akin to the phrase his case is for Allaah (to judge). Saeed ibn Jubayr and al-Saddi said: Shall not be punished for his past (means) for what he used to consume of riba before it was prohibited. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer; the material in brackets has been added for the purpose of clarification). On the basis of the above, you do not have to repay the interest which you received before you found out that it is haraam, but whatever you have received since then must be repaid if you still have it.

      "Praise be to Allah.The istiaadaha and basmalah are not part of the opening duaa reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), although they are part of what should be recited at the beginning of the prayer. Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to open his prayer with takbeer (Allaahu akbar). (Reported by Muslim, no. 498) As regards saying the istiaadhah and basmalah in the second rakah, the scholars differ on this matter. The basmalah should be recited in every rakah, when reciting al-Faatihah, but it should not be recited aloud, because there is some dispute as to whether it is part of al-Faatihah or not. Those scholars who say that it is not part of al-Faatihah recommend that it should be recited before al-Faatihah in each rakah. So to be on the safe side, the worshipper should recite the basmalah, silently, in every rakah. With regard to the istiaadhah, there is no difference among the scholars, all of whom say that it is not part of Soorat al-Faatihah, but there is some discussion among them concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): So when you want to recite the Quran, seek refuge with Allaah [al-Nahl 16:98] Those who take the aayah at face value say that the istiaadhah should be recited in every rakah, before reciting al-Faatihah and the basmalah. This is the opinion of the Shaafais and is the most correct opinion in their view. (Al-Majmoo, 3/323). Al-Hasan al-Basri, Ataa and Ibraaheem al-Nakhai also recommended taawwudh in every rakah. Ibn Hazm (may Allaah have mercy on him) favoured this opinion, and it was also reported that Imaam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhaab (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned it in Aadaab al-Mashiy ilal-Salaah. This opinion was also favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) (al-Insaaf 2/74), who said in al-Ikhtiyaaraat: Taawwudh is recommended at the beginning of every recitation. (p.50). This is also the opinion of al-Allaamah al-Albaani. Some scholars say that it is to be recited at the beginning of the first rakah only, and does not have to be repeated in the other rakahs. This is the opinion of the Hanbalis (al-Insaaf, 2/73). Al-Shawkaani thought that the correct opinion was to recite it in the first rakah only. (Nayl al-Awtaar, 3/39, 139-140). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allaah when he prayed. He used to say Aoodhu Billaahi min al-shaytaan il-rajeem min hamzihi wa nafkhihi wa nafathih (I seek refuge with Allaah from the accursed Shaytaan, from his evil insinuations). (reported by Abu Dawood). Sometimes he would expand on this and say, Aoodhu Billaahi il-Samee il-Aleem min al-shaytaan il-rajeem min hamzihi wa nafkhihi wa nafathih (I seek refuge with Allaah, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, from the accursed Shaytaan, from his evil insinuations).

When the two words are used together, istighfaar means seeking protection from the evil of what is past, and tawbah means returning to Allaah and seeking protection from the evil of one’s own bad deeds which one fears may lie ahead in the future. Istighfaar and tawbah are among the pairs of words which the scholars say convey one another’s meanings when used alone, but which have their own separate meanings when they are used together.

The aayah gives Muslim women permission to remove their hijaab in front of their women. Some scholars say that the pronoun hinna (their) is referring to specific people, otherwise there would be no need to be so specific. Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, Or their women means the Muslim women it excludes the mushrik women whether they are of ahl al-dhimmah (non-Muslims living peacefully under Islamic rule) or others. It is not permitted for a believing woman to uncover any of her body in front of a mushrik woman unless she is a slave belonging to her. (Al-Jaami li Ahkaam al-Quraan, 12/233). Ibn Katheer said something similar in his Tafseer. This is the opinion of the Hanafis, Maalikis and Shaafais, and is one of two opinions narrated from Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him. Some of the scholars thought that the pronoun in the phrase or their women did not mean that Muslim women should take off their hijaab in front of Muslim women but not mushrik and kaafir women. This is the correct view of the Hanbalis. They said: The phrase or their women applies to all women, and the pronoun hinna was added because of the context and pattern of the passage, which mentions their fathers, their sons, etc. So the pronoun is added to make this word match the others. The majority of scholars say that it is forbidden for a kaafir woman to look at a Muslim woman without hijaab, and this is the most correct interpretation of the aayah. If all women were meant, the aayah would have read or the women (in general), but what it actually says is or their women. There is no word or phrase in the Quraan that does not carry a specific meaning, and there is no evidence to support the idea that the pronoun is only there to make the word match the pattern of the rest of the passage.

Make not unlawful the tayyibat (all that is good as regards foods, things, deeds, beliefs, persons, etc.) which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.” [Al-Maidah 5:87] “Say: who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-tayyibat [all kinds of lawful things] of food? Say: they are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them). Thus We explain the ayat (Islamic laws) in detail for people who have knowledge.” [Al-A’araf 7:32] “Say: Tell me, what provision has Allah sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful. Say: Has Allah permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allah?” [Yunus 10:59] You should not think that it is better to abstain from these foods, or that doing so will be rewarded, or that a vegetarian/vegan is closer to Allah than others, and so on. It is not permitted to draw closer to Allah in this way. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who is the best of mankind and the closest to Allah, used to eat meat and drink milk and honey. When one of his Companions wanted to give up meat, he told him that this was wrong. Anas reported that there was a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), one of whom said, I will never marry women; another said, I will not eat meat; another said, I will not sleep on a bed; and another said, I will fast and never break my fast. News of this reached the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He praised and thanked Allah, then said: What is wrong with the people who are saying such and such? I pray and I sleep; I fast and I break my fast; and I marry women. Whoever deviates from my Sunnah (way) does not belong to me. (Reported by al-Nasai; the story is also to be found in the two Sahihs of al-Bukhari and Muslim). There is a great difference between not eating a certain kind of food because one does not like it, or it does not agree with one, or one has been put off for example by seeing an animal slaughtered when one was a child, which may leave one with a distaste for meat and other similar reasons, and thinking that meat is haram and that abstaining from it is an act of worship, as is done by Brahmins, monks and others who are misguided. Once this matter is clear in your mind, there is nothing wrong with not eating foods that you do not like. We will be happy to welcome you soon as our sister in Islam.

      "Praise be to Allah.Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Jareer al-Tabari gave a definition of muhsanah in Jaami’ al-Bayaan ‘an Ta’weel Aayi’l-Qur’aan (8/165): “Muhsanah means the woman who is chaste and pure … one who is chaste and protects her private parts from committing immoral acts, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And Maryam, the daughter of ‘Imraan, who guarded her chastity…’ [al-Tahreem 66:12], meaning that she kept herself above suspicious actions and protected herself from immoral conduct.” Then he discussed the interpretation of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… (lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…’ [al-Maa’idah 5:5] He said that some others said that what was meant by this aayah (‘… (lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…’) is chaste women from both groups, whether they were slaves or free. Those who were of this opinion considered it permissible to marry slave women who were Jews or Christians who practised their religions, because of this aayah, but they considered it haraam to marry promiscuous women, whether they were Muslims or from the People of the Book. Then he mentioned reports to support this opinion. He also said: ‘There was some dispute among the scholars about the interpretation of the phrase and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…- was this general or specific in application? Some said that it is general and applies to all chaste women, because muhsanaat means chaste women, and a Muslim is allowed to marry any woman of the People of the Book, free or slave, from a country whose people are engaged in hostilities with Islam or from a community which is living under Islamic rule. They use as evidence for this the apparent meaning of the phrase and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time… - taking muhsanaat to mean any chaste woman, whoever she may be. This is the opinion of those who take muhsanaat to mean “chaste women” in this context. Others say that it refers only to the women of Jewish and Christian communities who are living under Islamic rule. As regards those living in regions that are hostile to Islam, Muslims are not permitted to marry such women. He mentions an important condition for marrying a woman of the People of the Book, which every Muslim who wants to marry such a woman in a non-Muslim country should pay attention to. This condition is that he should be in a position where he is not afraid that his child will be forced into kufr. One of the obvious implications of this in our time is that a Muslim should not put himself in a position where he will be forced to raise his child as a kaafir in a non-Muslim country, where a child may be forced to study something about Christianity, for example, or he may be taken to church on Sundays, or the law may be on the side of the non-Muslim woman, allowing her to take her child wherever she wants and raise him in her family’s religion, etc. We ask Allaah to keep us safe from all that and we seek refuge with Him from being forsaken. Shaykh al-Sa’di said in his Tafseer (commentary on the Qur’aan), 1/458: “‘… (lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women – i.e., free and chaste - from the believers and chaste women –free and chaste - from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time…’ i.e., from among the Jews and Christians. This is adding specific details to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And do not marry al-mushrikaat (idolatresses, etc.) till they believe (worship Allaah alone)…’ [al-Baqarah 2:221].” As for promiscuous women, those who do not keep themselves chaste and free from immoral sexual conduct, it is not permitted to marry them, whether they are Muslims or from among the People of the Book (Jews and Christians), unless they repent, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Let no man guilty of fornication or adultery marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the Believers such a thing is forbidden.” [al-Noor 24:3] And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.First of all, may Allaah reward you with good for your kind words. We apologize for not answering questions in full. With regard to your question about this man who has asked for your hand in marriage, what you should concentrate on is the way he is now: is he doing his religious duties, like the five daily prayers, etc., is he keeping away from haraam things, has he repented for what he did in the past? Or not? If he is keeping his duty towards Allaah, then this is the good commitment to religion that is required according to the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): If there comes to you with an offer of marriage (for your daughter, sister, etc.) one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased, then marry (your daughter, sister, etc, to) him. If you do not do so, there will be mischief on earth and widespread corruption. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1004; classed as hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami, 270) It is not permitted to bring up the past of a person who regrets it and has repented and given up his sin; rather, this should be covered up. Whoever covers up his Muslim brother in this world, Allaah will cover him up in the Hereafter. (A saheeh hadeeth reported by Imaam Ahmad; Saheeh al-Jaami, 6287) But if a person is immoral and corrupt, and still has relationships from before, then you should never, ever agree to marry him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): The adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a mushrikah. And the woman who agrees to marry a mushrik or an adulterer, then she is either a prostitute or a mushrikah. Such a thing is forbidden to the believers. [al-Noor 24:3] Ibn Katheer said, commenting on the phrase Such a thing is forbidden to the believers: i.e., (it is forbidden for) a man to marry an immoral woman, or for a chaste woman to marry an immoral man. Hence Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said that the marriage contract between a chaste man and an immoral woman is invalid, so long as she remains like this, unless she is asked to repent and she does so, in which case the contract becomes valid, otherwise it is not valid. Similarly, the marriage of a free, chaste woman to a promiscuous, immoral man is invalid unless he repents sincerely, because Allaah says Such a thing is forbidden to the believers. There is no secret about the mischief, misery and problems that result from marriage to an immoral man. In many cases it is very difficult to get a true picture of a person and be sure about whether he is chaste or otherwise. But by researching, asking questions, consulting people and asking them for advice, whilst taking ones time and asking Allaah for help, one can get answers. We ask Allaah to choose the best for you, to help you and to guide you. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.First of all, we must thank you for you concern about the feelings of Muslims and your efforts to find out what may offend them so that you may avoid it. We are happy to provide you with a detailed answer to your question and more, in the hope that it may open the way to great good for you. Among the signs of the greatness of the blessed Islamic shareeah is the fact that there is no good thing, major or minor, that it has not commanded us to do or pointed the way to it, and there is no bad thing, major or minor, that it has not warned us against or forbidden. It is perfect and complete in all aspects, a fact which has often greatly astonished non-Muslims and earned their admiration. (At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), one of the mushrikeen (polytheists) said to (the Prophets Companion) Salmaan al-Farsi (may Allaah be pleased with him): Your Prophet has taught you everything, even how to defecate! Salmaan said: Yes, he forbade us to face the qiblah when urinating or defecating (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 16; he said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth; also reported in Saheeh Muslim and elsewhere). Islamic shareeah includes a number of rules and manners to be followed when answering the call of nature, including the following: Not to face the qiblah (direction of prayer, i.e. the Kabah which was built in Makkah by Ibrahim, upon whom be peace, as commanded by Allaah) when urinating or defecating. This is out of respect for the Qiblah and for the symbols and rituals of Allaah. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When any one of you sits down to answer the call of nature, he should not face the qiblah or turn his back towards it. (Reported by Muslim, 389). He should not touch his penis with his right hand when urinating, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When any one of you urinates, he should not hold his penis in his right hand or clean it with his right hand; and (when drinking), he should not breathe into the vessel. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 150). He should not remove najaasah (impurity) with his right hand; the left hand should be used for this purpose, because of the hadeeth quoted above, and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When any one of you wipes himself, he should not use his right hand. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5199). The Prophets wife Hafsah (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to use his right hand for eating, drinking, making wudoo, getting dressed, and giving and taking things, and he used to use his left hand for other things. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 4912). Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When any one of you cleans himself, he should not use his right hand, he should use his left hand. (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 308; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 322). The Sunnah is to answer the call of nature sitting, making oneself close to the ground, because this is more concealing, and makes it less likely that spray from one's urine will come back on ones body or clothes, making them dirty. If a person can be sure of avoiding this, then it is permissible to urinate standing up. A person should be concealed from the sight of others when answering the call of nature. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to prefer to go behind a rise in the ground or a garden of date palms. (Reported by Muslim, 517). If a person is out in an open space and cannot find anything to conceal him when he needs to answer the call of nature, he should move far away from the other people around him, because al-Mugheerah ibn Shubah said: I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on a journey, when he felt the need to answer the call of nature, so he went far away. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 20; he said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth). Abd-Allaah ibn Abi Quraad said: I went out with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to an open space, and when he needed to answer the call of nature, he moved away. (Reported by al-Nisaai, 16; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 4651) A person should not uncover his awrah (private parts) until after he has squatted close to the ground, because this is more concealing, as Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to answer the call of nature, he would not lift his garment until he had squatted close to the ground. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 14; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 4652). If a person is in a (modern) toilet, he should not lift his garment until he has closed the door and is out of sight of other people. With regard to this point and the one before, it is worth noting that the habit of many people in the West and elsewhere, of urinating in a standing position in front of other people in public toilets (using urinals) is something which goes against good manners, modesty and decency, and is repulsive to anyone who possesses sound common sense and wisdom. How can anybody uncover in front of other people the awrah (private parts) which Allaah has placed between his legs to conceal it and commanded him to cover it? The idea that it should be covered is well established among all wise and decent people of all races. It is wrong in principle to build restrooms of this shameful type, where the users can see one another, thus making them worse than some kinds of animals whose habit is to conceal themselves from one another when urinating or defecating. It is also good manners according to Shareeah to recite certain adhkaar (supplications) when entering or leaving the toilet, which are quite appropriate to the situation and place. Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught us that when entering the toilet, we should say: Allaahumma innee aoodhi bika min al-khubthi wal-khabaaith (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from male and female devils). When leaving the toilet, he should say: Ghufraanak (I seek Your forgiveness). He should be careful to remove all impurity after answering the call of nature, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned against being careless in cleaning oneself after urinating: Most of the punishment of the grave will be because of urine. (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 342; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 1202). Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) passed by two graves, and said: They are being punished, but they are not being punished for any major sin. One of them used not to protect himself (i.e. keep himself clean from) his urine, and the other used to walk about spreading malicious gossip. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5592). Any impurity should be washed or wiped three times or an odd number of times greater than three, according to whatever is needed to cleanse it, because Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to wash his posterior three times. Ibn Umar said: We did this too and found it to be healing and cleansing. (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 350; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 4993). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When anyone of you cleans himself (with stones or similar material) let him use an odd number. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; classed as hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami, 375). He should not use bones or dung to clean himself or wipe away the impurity, rather, he should use tissue, stones, and the like. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that he used to carry a vessel for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to do wudoo and clean himself after answering the call of nature. Whilst he was following him, he (the Prophet) asked, Who is that? He said: I am Abu Hurayrah. He said: Get me some stones I can use to clean myself, but do not bring me any bones or dung. So I brought him some stones, carrying them in the hem of my garment, and placed them by his side, then I went away. When he had finished, I came back and asked him, What is wrong with bones and dung? He said: They are the food of the jinn. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3571). A person should not urinate into stagnant water, because Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade anyone to urinate into stagnant water (reported by Muslim, 423), and because this makes the water impure and harms those who use it. A person should not urinate by the roadside or in places where people seek shade, because this is offensive to them. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fear the two things that bring curses. They asked, What are the two things that bring curses, O Messenger of Allaah? He said: When a person relieves himself in the road where people walk or in the place where they seek shade. (Reported by Abu Dawud, 23; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 110). One should not greet a person who is answering the call of nature, or return a greeting whilst one is answering the call of nature, out of respect to Allaah by not mentioning His name in a dirty place. [Translators note: the Islamic greeting is al-salaam alaykum (peace be upon you); one of the names of Allaah is al-Salaam (the Peace)]. Jaabir ibn Abd-Allaah reported that a man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whilst he was urinating, and greeted him. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: If you see me in this state, do not greet me, because if you do, I will not respond. (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 346; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 575). The majority of scholars say that it is makrooh (disliked) to speak in the restroom unnecessarily. These are some of the rules and manners prescribed by the shareeah of Islam in this matter which is repeated many times a day by every person. If the shareeah has paid such minute attention to the details of such a mundane matter, what do you think it has to say about more important issues? Do you know of any other religion or system in the world that has brought laws like this? This is enough, by Allaah, to prove its perfection and beauty, and the necessity of following it. We ask Allaah to give us and you strength and to guide us all to the truth. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Al-Daaraqutni reported in his Sunan (2/278) with an isnaad from Haatib that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever visits me after I die, it is as if he visited me when I was still alive…” This is a hadeeth which many of the scholars of hadeeth judged to be false and not to have been reported with a saheeh isnaad from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Among the scholars who voiced this opinion was al-Haafiz al-Dhahabi in Lisaan al-Meezaan (4/285), in his biography of one of the narrators, Haaroon ibn Abi Qaz’ah. Al-Dhahabi said: “…Haaroon ibn Abi Qaz’ah al-Madani [reported] from a man” – about visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Al-Bukhaari said: “This is not to be accepted or followed.” Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Lisaan al-Meezaan (6/217): “Al-Azdi said: ‘Haaroon Abu Qaz’ah reports mursal ahaadeeth from a man of Aal Haatib.’ I [Ibn Hajar] say: from this we understand that what he is referring to is al-Azdi. Ya’qoob ibn Shaybah also classed him as da’eef (weak).” Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar also mentioned him in al-Talkhees al-Habeer, in his comment on the ahaadeeth of al-Raafa’i al-Kabeer (2/266). He said, “In his isnaad is the unknown [majhool] man” – meaning a man from Aal Haatib. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in al-Tawassul wa’l-Waseelah (p. 134) about this hadeeth: “It is obviously a lie that goes against Islam. Anyone who visited him during his lifetime and believed in him, was one of his Companions, especially if he was among those who migrated to join him or fought alongside him. It is proven that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Do not slander my Companions, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you were to spend gold equal to the size of Uhud, it would not equal the deeds of one of them, not even half of it.’ [Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim]. Anyone who comes after the Sahaabah cannot be like the Sahaabah by doing obligatory duties such as Hajj, jihaad, the five daily prayers and sending blessings upon the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so how can he become equal to them by doing something that is not obligatory according to the consensus of the Muslims? We are not even supposed to travel for this purpose, in fact it is forbidden to do so. However, travelling to the [Prophet’s] Mosque, and to al-Masjid al-Aqsaa [in Jerusalem], for the purpose of praying there, is mustahabb (encouraged), and travelling to the Ka’bah for Hajj is waajib (obligatory). If a person who undertakes a journey that is waajib or mustahabb still cannot be like one of the Sahaabah who travelled to visit the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during his lifetime, how can they achieve this by undertaking a journey that is not allowed?” He also said (p. 133): “All of the ahaadeeth about visiting his grave are da’eef, and are not to be relied upon in matters of religion. For this reason none of the authors of books of Saheeh and Sunan reported them at all; they were only narrated by those who reported da’eef ahaadeeth, such as al-Daaraqutni, al-Bazzaar and others. Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Da’eefah (no. 1021) about this hadeeth: it is baatil (false). He mentioned what is wrong with the hadeeth, namely the man who is not named, and classed Haaroon Abu Qaz’ah as da’eef. There is a third fault with the hadeeth, which is that it causes confusion and contradiction. Then Shaykh al-Albaani said: “In general, the isnaad of this hadeeth is weak.” He also said in al-Da’eefah (no. 47): “many people think that Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah and those who follow him among the Salafis forbid visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) altogether. This is a lie and a fabrication, and it is not the only lie told about Ibn Taymiyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, or about the Salafis. Everyone who reads the books of Ibn Taymiyah will see that he says it is permissible to visit his grave (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and that doing so is recommended (mustahabb), so long as it is not associated with any objectionable practices or innovations (bid’ah), such as travelling solely for that purpose, because of the hadeeth “No one should set out purposely except to visit three mosques.” The hadeeth does not describe a ban only on travelling to visit other mosques, as many people think; it also includes a ban on setting out to visit any place which people think will bring them closer to Allaah, whether it is a mosque, a grave or any other place. This is indicated by the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah who said: ‘I met Basrah ibn Abi Basrah al-Ghifaari and he asked me, ‘Where are you coming from?’ I said, ‘From al-Toor [Sinai].’ He said, ‘If I had met you before you left, you would not have gone there! I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: ‘Do not travel except to three mosques.’” (Reported by Ahmad and others with a saheeh isnaad). This clearly indicates that the Sahaabah understood the hadeeth to be general in application [i.e., it did not apply only to mosques]. This is supported by the fact that it is not reported that any of them ever set out with the intention of visiting a grave. They are the predecessors of Ibn Taymiyah in this regard, so whoever condemns Ibn Taymiyah is in effect condemning the salaf (the righteous predecessors), may Allaah be pleased with them. May Allaah have mercy on the one who said: “All goodness is in following those who went before (the salaf) and all evil is in following the innovations of those who came later.” In conclusion, travelling with the intention of visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is bid’ah and is haraam, because of the hadeeth which forbids travelling to worship in any place except the three mosques. As for visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when one happens to be in Madeenah, this is perfectly acceptable, as is travelling with the intention of praying in the Prophet’s Mosque as an act of worship and seeking to draw close to Allaah. Those that are confused about this issue are those who do not understand the difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Are horoscopes haram? Evidence for prohibiting zodiac signs in Islam How to avoid fortune-telling Praise be to Allah.Are horoscopes haram? Astrology , horoscopes, superstition and fortune-telling are all actions of ignorance which Islam came to show as false and to explain that they are acts of polytheism. This is because they involve depending on something other than Allah and believing that benefit and harm come from something other than Him, and believing the words of fortune-tellers and soothsayers who falsely claim to have knowledge of the unseen in order to cheat people of their money and change their beliefs. Evidence for prohibiting zodiac signs in Islam The evidence for that is the hadith narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan with a sahih isnad from Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever learns anything of astrology has learned a branch of witchcraft (al-sihr)…” Al-Bazzar narrated with a sound chain of transmission from ‘Imran ibn Husayn that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He is not one of us who practises augury or has it done for him, who tells fortunes or has his fortune told, or who practises witchcraft or has that done for him.” Whoever claims to know some matter of the unseen either is a fortune-teller or is acting like a fortune-teller in some sense, because Allah is the only One Who has knowledge of the unseen. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning); “Say: ‘None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghayb (Unseen) except Allah…’” [al-Naml 27:65] How to avoid fortune-telling My advice to everyone who has anything to do with these matters is to repent to Allah and ask for His forgiveness, and to depend only on Allah and to put their trust in Him in all their affairs, whilst following the practical means that are prescribed or permitted in shari’ah. They should give up these matters of jahiliyyah, keep away from them and avoid asking the people who practise them or believe what they say, out of obedience to AllahAllah and His Messenger (peace and blessings of AllahAllah be upon him), and in order to protect his commitment to Islam and his ‘aqidah (religious belief).

      "Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth you mention was narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) in his Saheeh from Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said (that Allaah said): “Vowing does not bring to the son of Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments), but vowing is imposed on him by way of preordainment. Through vowing I make a miser spend of his wealth.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 6119) Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this hadeeth: “Ibn ‘Umar said: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the making of vows.’ … A clear statement prohibiting vows came in the report of al-‘Alaa’ ibn ‘Abd al-Rahmaan from his father from Abu Hurayrah, recorded by Muslim in the words ‘Do not make vows,’ and in the phrase ‘(Making vows) does not bring forward anything or delay anything [i.e., it has no effect whatsoever],’ and in the report of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Murrah, ‘It does not change anything,’ – which is more general. A similar phrase was reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah: ‘Vowing does not bring to the son of Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments)…’ Ibn al-Atheer said in al-Nihaayah: ‘The point of the hadeeth is that he told them that this thing (making vows) does not bring any immediate benefit or turn away any immediate harm, and it does not change what has been decreed. Thus he said, Do not make vows, as you know that you cannot get, or turn away, anything by means of vows that Allaah has not already decreed for you. If you make a vow then fulfill it, because whatever you have vowed becomes obligatory for you.’ (Then Ibn Hajar quotes the opinions of a number of scholars on the reason why making vows is prohibited): … The reason may be that the person who makes a vow does not do so in order to draw closer to Allaah, but will only do so if he gets what he wanted, as if this is an exchange, which corrupts his intention to draw closer to Allaah. This interpretation is indicated by the words, ‘It does not bring any good,’ and ‘Vowing does not bring to the son of Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments).’ This is a clear statement as to why vows should not be made. The phrase ‘it does not bring any good’ means that the end result will be no good, and it might be too difficult to fulfil the vow, or it might mean that (the vow) will not bring about good if it has not been decreed for him…. Al-Nawawi said: ‘The phrase “it does not bring any good” means that it will not stop anything that has already been decreed, as is clear from the other reports.’ … (Then Ibn Hajar quotes from Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed), saying that he described the difference between nadhr al-mujaazaah (vow of repayment, one in which an act of worship is promised in return for a favour), which is forbidden, and nadhr al-ibtidaa’ (vow of initiative, where one does the promised act of worship first, without waiting to see if the favour is granted or not), which is a pure act of worship.” In al-Mufahhim, al-Qurtubi confirmed the idea that the ahaadeeth forbid nadhr al-mujaazaah: ‘This refers to a situation where a man might say, for example, “If Allaah heals this person who is sick, I will give such-and-such in charity.” The reason why it is disliked is that he postpones doing the act of worship mentioned, and makes it conditional upon getting the desired result. This makes it quite clear that he does not have the sincere intention of drawing closer to Allaah, because he has clearly stated that his approach is that of giving something in return for something. It is quite clear that if the sick person is not healed, he will not give the charity which is conditional upon the sick person’s recovery. This is the attitude of the miser, who does not give anything of his wealth except in exchange for some immediate return, usually something that is worth more than what he is prepared to give. This is what is referred to in the hadeeth: “Through vowing I make a miser spend of his wealth.” To this could be added the point that there is an ignorant belief that making a vow guarantees that one will get the desired result, or that Allaah will do what a person wants because of the vow. Both notions are addressed in the hadeeth: “Vowing does not bring to the son of Adam anything that I have not already written in his Qadar (preordainments).”’ Concerning the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “They (are those who) fulfil (their) vows…” [al-Insaan 76:7] al-Tabaraani reported with a saheeh isnaad that Qutaadah said: “They used to vow to do acts of worship such as praying, fasting, giving zakaat and going on pilgrimage (Hajj and ‘Umrah), and other acts which were obligatory for them, and so Allaah called them abraar (those who are pious, fear Allaah, and avoid evil – see al-Insaan 76:5). It is clear that it is not those who make vows of repayment (nadhr al-mujaazaah) who are praised…” Al-Baydaawi said: “People usually make vows conditional upon gaining some benefit or removing some evil, and this is forbidden because it is the way of the miser. If a generous person wants to draw closer to Allaah, he starts doing good deeds straight away, but the miser would never voluntarily give anything except in return for something which he is given first. This attitude will not protect him from anything that has already been decreed, or bring him any good thing that has not been decreed for him. The vow will be in accordance with qadar and will make him give something that he would not have given otherwise… And Allaah knows best.”\n",

      "Contents Related Reading the Quran during menses Evidence for forbidding women from reading the Quran during menses Evidence for allowing women to read the Quran during menses Touching the Quran during menses Praise be to Allah.Reading the Quran during menses Reading the Quran during menses is one of the issues on which the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, differed. The majority of fuqaha say that it is haram for a woman to recite Quran during her period, until she is tahir (pure) again. The only exceptions they make is in the case of dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and phrases that are not intended as tilawah (recitation), such as saying “Bismillahi’r-Rahmani’r-Rahim” or “Inna Lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un”, or other phrases from the Quran which are repeated as general du’as. Evidence for forbidding women from reading the Quran during menses They base their evidence for forbidding menstruating women to recite Quran on several things, including the following: 1- Menstruation is seen as coming under the rulings that apply to one who is junub (in a state of impurity following sexual intercourse), because both states require ghusl. This is based on the hadith narrated by ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to teach the Quran and he never prevented anyone from learning it except those who were in a state of janabah (major ritual impurity).” (Reported by Abu Dawud, 1/281; al-Tirmidhi, 146; al-Nasai, 1/144; Ibn Majah, 1/207; Ahmad, 1/84; Ibn Khuzaymah, 1/104. Al-Tirmidhi said: a sahih hasan hadith. Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: the truth is that it is the type of hasan hadith that could be used as evidence). 2- The hadith of Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “The menstruating woman and the one who is in a state of major ritual impurity (janabah) should not recite anything of the Quran.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 131; Ibn Majah, 595; al-Daraqutni (1/117); al-Bayhaqi, 1/89. This is a da’if hadith, because it was reported by Isma’il ibn ‘Ayyash from the Hijazis, and his reports from them are da’if as is well known to those who are conversant with the study of hadith. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said (21/460): it is a da’if hadith by the unanimous agreement of the scholars of hadith. See Nasb al-Rayah, 1/195; al-Talkhis al-Habir, 1/183). Evidence for allowing women to read the Quran during menses Some scholars say that it is permitted for a menstruating woman to recite Quran. This is the opinion of Malik, and one opinion narrated from Ahmad, which Ibn Taymiyah preferred and which al-Shawkani believed to be correct. The scholars based the following points on this opinion: 1- The principle is that things are allowed and permitted unless there is evidence to the contrary. There is no such evidence to say that a menstruating woman is not allowed to recite Quran. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: “There is no clear, sahih text to indicate that a menstruating woman is forbidden to recite Quran… It is known that women used to menstruate at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he did not forbid them to recite Quran, or to remember Allah (dhikr) and offer du’a.” 2- Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, commands (Muslims) to recite Quran. He praises the one who does so, and promises him (or her) a great reward. No one is excluded from this except the one concerning whom there is solid evidence (dalil), and there is no such evidence in the case of menstruating women, as stated above. 3- The analogy between the menstruating woman and the one who is in a state of janabah is made despite the fact that there are differences between them. The one who is in a state of janabah has the option of removing the “barrier” by making ghusl, unlike the menstruating woman. A woman’s period usually lasts for some length of time, whereas the person who is in a state of janabah is required to do ghusl when the time for prayer comes. 4- Preventing a menstruating woman from reciting Quran deprives her of the chance to earn reward, and it may make her forget something of the Quran, or she may need to recite it for the purposes of teaching or learning. From the above, it is clear that the evidence of those who allow a menstruating woman to recite Quran is stronger. If a woman wants to err on the side of caution, she can limit her recitation to the passages which she is afraid of forgetting. Touching the Quran during menses It is very important to note that what we have been discussing here is restricted to what a menstruating woman recites from memory. When it comes to reading from the Mus-haf (the Arabic text itself), a different rule applies. The correct view of the scholars is that it is forbidden to touch the mus-haf when one is in any kind of state of impurity, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… which none can touch except the purified.” [al-Waqi’ah 56:79] In a letter to ‘Amr ibn Hazm, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told the people of Yemen: “No one should touch the Quran except one who is tahir (pure).” The hadith is reported by Malik, 1/199; al-Nasai, 8/57; Ibn Hibban, 793; al-Bayhaqi, 1/87. Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: A group of scholars classed this hadith as sahih because it is so well known. Al-Shafi'i said: It is proven by them that it was a letter sent by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: “This letter is famous among the scholars of sirah, and is so well known among the scholars that it does not need an isnad. It is like tawatur because the people accepted and recognized it. Shaykh al-Albani said that it is sahih. Al-Talkhis al-Habir, 4/17. See also: Nasb al-Rayah, 1/196; Irwa al-Ghalil, 1/158). (Hashiyat Ibn ‘Abidin, 1/159; al-Majmu’, 1/356; Kashshaf al-Qina’, 1/147; al-Mughni, 3/461; Nayl al-Awtar, 1/226; Majmi’ al-Fatawa, 21/460; al-Sharh al-Mumti’ li’l-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/291) For more about issues related to menses, please see these answers: 72417 , 75727 , and 121366 .

      "Contents Related Is blood donation halal? Does blood donation break wudu? Praise be to Allah.Is blood donation halal? If it is necessary to carry out a blood transfusion , there is no sin on the patient, the doctors or the donor, because of the following: 1. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind…” [al-Maidah 5:32]. This verse indicates the virtue of being the cause of saving the life of someone whom it is forbidden to kill, and there is no doubt that the doctors and blood donors are among the causes of saving the life of patients who are at risk of dying if a blood transfusion is not carried out. 2. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “He has forbidden you only the dead animals, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allah. But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Baqarah 2:173]. This verse indicates that there is no sin on the one who does a forbidden thing out of necessity; the sick person accepts a blood transfusion out of necessity, and there is nothing wrong with the donor giving his blood either. 3. The guidelines of Islamic Shari`ah dictate that donating blood should be permitted, because one of its principles is that in cases of necessity, things that are ordinarily forbidden are permitted, and that ways should be found to ease hardship. The sick person is certainly in a hardship situation, and is compelled by necessity. The hardship he is facing could lead to his death, so it is permissible for him to receive a blood transfusion. (For more details on the issue of donating blood, please see Question #2570 ). Does blood donation break wudu? As regards the question of whether wudu is broken by the flowing of blood, this is an issue concerning which the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, differed. Those who think that bleeding breaks wudu quote as evidence the hadith of Abu’l-Darda (may Allah be pleased with him): “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) vomited, then did wudu.” They drew an analogy between vomit and blood, because both are najis (impure) when they come out of the body. This hadith was narrated by Ahmad (4/449), Abu Dawud (2981) and al-Tirmidhi (87), who said: “More than one of the scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others among the Tabi’in thought that wudu should be done after vomiting or having a nosebleed. This is the opinion of Sufyan al-Thawri, Ibn al-Mubarak, Ahmad and Ishaq. Some scholars said that wudu is not necessary after vomiting or having a nosebleed. This is the opinion of Malik and al-Shafi’i.” This was also narrated as being the opinion of Ahmad. Al-Baghawi said: It is the opinion of most of the Sahabah and Tabi’in.” The most correct view is that bleeding does not break one’s wudu, although it is preferable (mustahabb) to make wudu after bleeding. The evidence for this is as follows: 1. Wudu is considered to be valid until there is proof that something breaks it. There is no proof narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that bleeding breaks wudu , hence Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “There is no proof whatsoever that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made it obligatory to do wudu because of that (bleeding).” Shaykh Ibn Sa’di (may Allah have mercy on him) said, the correct opinion is that bleeding and vomiting , etc., do not break wudu, whether they are large or small in volume, because there is no evidence to prove that they break wudu, and the guiding principle is that wudu remains valid. 2. One cannot draw an analogy between blood and anything else, because the reasons behind them are not the same. 3. The idea that bleeding breaks wudu is contrary to what was reported from the salaf (early generations), for example, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) continued to pray although his wound was pouring with blood. Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) said, “The Muslims continue to pray even when they are wounded.” 4. The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did wudu after he vomited does not indicate that it is obligatory to do so, because the rules of fiqh say that the mere fact that he did something, unless it was accompanied by a command to do it, does not make it obligatory. All that this proves is that it is good to follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this instance. Hence Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Doing wudu after cupping and vomiting is mustahabb and is good.” To sum up the above, it is mustahabb (preferable) for a blood donor to do wudu after giving blood, but if he does not do wudu, it is still OK. And Allah knows best.

      "Contents Related Is masturbation haram? Does masturbation break your fast? Praise be to Allah.Is masturbation haram? No doubt masturbation is haram according to most of the scholars, as Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said. If this happens in Ramadan, this is worse, and if there is ejaculation of sperm because of the masturbation , the violation of the sanctity of the fast is even more severe in sin. Does masturbation break your fast? From the time the maniy (semen) is ejaculated, the fast is broken, but the person should still fast for the rest of that day. It is not permissible for him to stop fasting, because of the sanctity of the month. You have to repent for breaking your fast by deliberately ejaculating, and you also have to repent for not keeping the fast for the rest of the day and for violating the sanctity of the fast by doing something else that broke the fast, namely eating food. You also have to fast one day to make up for breaking your fast. Increase the number of good deeds (hasanat) you do and observe nafl (supererogatory) fasts, for good deeds (hasanat) cancel out bad deeds (sayyiat). And Allaah is Forgiving and Merciful.

      "Praise be to Allah.Islam commands us to lower our gaze and forbids looking at non-mahram women. This is in order to purify people’s souls and protect their honour. There are, however, certain exceptions in which it is permissible to look at a non-mahram woman for reasons of necessity, one of which is in the case of proposing marriage, because it is the basis on which a very important decision affecting a person’s life will be taken. There are texts which indicate that it is permissible to look at one’s fiancée, as follows: From Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If one of you proposes marriage to a woman, if he can look at her to see that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.’ I proposed marriage to a young woman, and I used to hide where I could see her, until I saw that which encouraged me to go ahead and marry her, so I did so.’” According to another report he said, ‘a young woman of Bani Salamah. I used to hide from her, until I saw that which encouraged me to go ahead and marry her, so I did so.” (Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 1832, 1834) From Abu Hurayrah: “I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when a man came and told him that he had married a woman of the Ansaar. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, ‘Have you seen her?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go and look at her, for there is something in the eyes of the Ansaar.” (Reported by Muslim, no. 1424; and by al-Daaraqutni, 3/253 (34)) From al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah: “I proposed marriage to a woman, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Have you seen her?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Look at her, because it is more fitting that love and compatibility be established between you.’” According to another report: “So he did that, and he married her and mentioned that they got along.” (Reported by al-Daaraqutni, 3/252 (31, 32); Ibn Maajah, 1/574) From Sahl ibn Sa’d (may Allaah be pleased with him): “A woman came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I have come to give myself to you (in marriage).” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) looked at her closely, then he lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had not made a decision about her, she sat down. One of his Companions stood up and said, O Messenger of Allaah, if you do not want her, then marry her to me…’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 7/19; Muslim, 4/143; al-Nisaa’i, 6/113 bi Sharh al-Suyooti; al-Bayhaqi, 7/84) The sayings of the scholars on the extent to which one may look at one’s fiancée Al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “If he wants to marry a woman, he is not allowed to see her without a headcover. He may look at her face and hands when she is covered, with or without her permission. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent…’ [al-Noor 24:31]. He said: ‘The face and hands.’” (al-Haawi al-Kabeer, 9/34). Imaam al-Nawawi said in Rawdat al-Taalibeen wa ‘Umdat al-Mufteen (7, 19-20): “When (a man) wants to marry (a woman), it is preferable (mustahabb) for him to look at her so that he will have no regrets. According to another view, it is not preferable but it is allowed. The first view is correct because of the ahaadeeth, and it is permitted to look repeatedly, with or without her permission. If it is not easy to look at her, he may send a woman to check her out and describe her to him. A woman may also look at a man if she wants to marry him, for she will like in him what he likes in her. What is permissible for him to look at is the face and hands, front and back. He should not look at anything else.” Abu Haneefah permitted looking at the feet as well as the face and hands. (Bidaayah al-Mujtahid wa Nihayyat al-Muqtasid, 3/10) “It is permissible to look at the face, hands and feet, and no more than that.” Ibn Rushd also quoted it as above. Among the reports from the madhhab of Imaam Maalik: He may look at the face and hands only. He may look at the face, hands and forearms only. A number of reports were narrated from Imaam Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him), one of which says that he may look at the face and forearms. The second says that he may look at what usually appears such as the neck, calves and so on. This was quoted by Ibn Qudaamah in al-Mughni (7/454), Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah in Tahdheeb al-Sunan (3/25-26), and al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari (11/78)… The reliable opinion in the books of the Hanbalis is the second opinion. From the above, it is clear that the majority of scholars say that a man is allowed to look at his fiancée’s face and hands, because the face indicates beauty or ugliness, and the hands indicate the slimness or plumpness (literally, ‘fertility’) of the body. Abu’l-Faraj al-Maqdisi said: “There is no dispute among the scholars that he is permitted to look at the face.. the focus of beauty and the place at which one looks.” Ruling on touching one’s fiancée or being alone with her Al-Zayla’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permissible for him to touch her face or hands – even if is sure that this will not provoke desire – because she is still haraam for him, and there is no need for him to do so.” In Durar al-Bihaar it says: “It is not permitted for the qaadi, the witnesses or the fiancé to touch her, even if they are sure that this will not provoke desire, because there is no need for that…” (Radd al-Muhtaar ‘ala’l-Durr al-Mukhtaar, 5/237) Ibn Qudaamah said: “It is not permitted for him to be alone with her, because she is forbidden and Islam only allows him to look, thus khulwah (being alone with her) remains forbidden, and because there is no certainty that nothing forbidden will take place if he is alone with her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘No man is alone with a woman, but the Shaytaan is the third one present.’ He should not look at her in a lustful or suspicious manner. Ahmad said, in a report narrated by Saalih, ‘He may look at the face, but not in a lustful manner.’ He may look repeatedly, and examine her beauty, because the aim cannot be achieved in any other way.” The fiancée’s permission to look A man is permitted to look at the woman to whom he wishes to propose marriage, even without her permission or knowledge. This is what is indicated by the saheeh ahaadeeth. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (9/157): “The majority of scholars said: he is permitted to look at her if he wishes without her permission.” The hadeeth scholar Shaykh Muhammad Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani said in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah (1/156), supporting this view: “Similar evidence is seen in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the hadeeth, ‘Even if she does not know.’ This is supported by the actions of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them), in accordance with the Sunnah, such as Muhammad ibn Muslimah and Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah, both of whom hid so as to see of their fiancées that which would encourage them to go ahead and marry them…” Note: Shaykh al-Albaani also said (op.cit., p. 156): “From Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him)” ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to marry a woman, so he sent another woman to look at her and said, “Smell her mouth (front teeth) and look at the back of her ankles.” (Reported by al-Haakim, 2/166, who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Also reported by al-Bayhaqi, 7/87. In Majma’ al-Zawaa’id (4/507) he said, ‘”Reported by Ahmad and al-Bazzaar, and the men of al-Bazzaar are thiqaat.”) In Mughni al-Muhtaaj (2/128) it says: “What we understand from this report is that the one who is sent may describe to the one who sends her more than that which he himself may see, so this sending achieves more than just looking.” And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related What is siwak? Is it sunnah to use the siwak? Times when use of siwak is recommended What should be used for siwak (cleaning the mouth) Things that may not be used for siwak Attributes of siwak How to use the siwak Etiquette of using siwak Using one's fingers to clean one's mouth Praise be to Allah.What is siwak? Siwak means cleaning the mouth and teeth with a siwak which is the name given to the tool used. The siwak is a stick or twig used for this purpose. Siwak is a method of cleaning the mouth which also earns the pleasure of Allah, as is proven in the hadith of ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Siwak cleanses the mouth and pleases the Lord. (Reported by al-Bukhari in his Sahih, 2/274, and by Ahmad, 6/47, and al-Nasai, 1/50. Its isnad is sahih, see al-Irwa 1/105) Is it sunnah to use the siwak? Use of the siwak is repeatedly encouraged, as in the hadith of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Were it not for the fact that I did not want to make things too hard for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak at every time of prayer. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2/299 and Muslim, 1/151). According to another report narrated by al-Bukhari, he said: at every time of making wudu. Imam al-Nawawi reported that the respectable scholars were agreed that use of the siwak is sunnah and is encouraged. One of the signs of its importance is the fact that some of the salaf (early generations of Islam), such as Ishaq ibn Rahawayh, thought that it was obligatory. Times when use of siwak is recommended Siwak is recommended at all times of night and day, because of the general sense of the hadith quoted above from ‘Aishah, Siwak cleanses the mouth and pleases the Lord. The scholars have also mentioned situations where use of the siwak is even more strongly encouraged. These include: When making wudu and at times of prayer. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Were it not for the fact that I did not want to make things too hard for my ummah, I would have commanded them to use the siwak at every time of prayer. According to another report he said: at every time of making wudu as already stated above. When entering one's home to be with one’s family. ‘Aishah was asked what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did when he first came home. She said, When he entered his house, the first thing he would do was to use the siwak. (Reported by Muslim, 1/220) When getting up from sleep. Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) got up during the night, he would clean his mouth thoroughly with the siwak. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1/98 and Muslim, 1/220) When the smell of one’s mouth changes whether this is because of eating food with a strong odour, or because of not eating or drinking for a long time, etc. Siwak is cleansing for the mouth, which means that it should definitely be used when the mouth needs cleaning. When going to the mosque . Using siwak is part of the adornment which we are commanded to wear for every prayer, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O Children of Adam! Take your adornment while praying [al-A'raf 7:31]. It is also important because the angels are present in the mosque, and one is going to meet with other worshippers there. When reading Quran and joining gatherings in which Allah is remembered (dhikr), because the angels are present on such occasions. Using siwak when fasting The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) are agreed that there is nothing wrong with using siwak during the day when one is fasting , but they differed with regard to using it after noon, which some of them disliked (regarded as makruh). The correct view is that it is sunnah for one who is fasting, just as it is for anyone else, because of the general sense of the reports which prove that it is sunnah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not make any exceptions or state any specific time, and a statement that is general in nature should continue to be taken as general unless there is evidence to indicate that it is specific in application. The hadith used as evidence to forbid using siwak after noon is attributed to ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), who is quoted as saying that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, When you fast, use siwak in the morning but do not use it in the afternoon. (Reported by al-Daraqutni) This is a weak hadith. Ibn Hajar said, in al-Talkhis al-Habir, 1/62: a weak isnad). There is no proof that this can be attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). With regard to the use of the hadith, the odour that comes from the mouth of the fasting person is better in the sight of Allah than the scent of musk (reported by al-Bukhari, 2/29 and Muslim, 2/806) as evidence, this mouth odour will not be dispelled by use of siwak because it is caused by the stomach being empty, and it could occur early in the day if a person has not eaten suhur. All the scholars are agreed that it is permissible for a fasting person to use siwak early in the day. This shows that use of siwak is encouraged even when fasting, and there is no difference between using it early in the day or later on. What should be used for siwak (cleaning the mouth) The scholars are agreed that the best thing for cleaning the mouth is the twigs of the arak tree, because of its good smell, and because it has brush-like fibers which are effective for cleaning food particles etc. from between the teeth, and because of the hadith of ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: I used to gather siwak sticks from the arak tree for the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). (Reported by Ahmad, 3991; its isnad is hasan, see al-Irwa 1/104) If arak twigs are not available, the scholars recommended using palm-leaf stalks, or twigs of the olive tree. The hadiths that have been narrated concerning this, however, are not sahih. The correct view is that any kind of sticks that are cleansing and not harmful may be used instead of siwak, if it is not available, to clean the mouth and remove dirt from the teeth. This includes modern toothbrushes which are known to be beneficial in this regard. Things that may not be used for siwak The scholars have stated that it is forbidden to use poisonous sticks, things that are not pure and anything that may cause bleeding, illness or any other harm. Attributes of siwak The jurists have described the siwak as a stick of medium length and thickness, no thicker than ones little finger, and free of knots. It should not be so wet that it will twist, because then it will not remove dirt, nor should it be so dry that it will hurt the mouth or crack during use. No doubt this is describing the ideal, otherwise the reports do not specify any particular type of siwak. It is permissible to use any kind of siwak that will do the job. How to use the siwak The scholars have differed as to whether siwak should be done with the right hand or the left hand. One group, the majority, think that it is better to use the right hand, because of the general meaning of the hadith narrated by ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked to start with the right when putting on his shoes, dismounting (from his camel), when cleaning himself, and in all things. (Agreed upon). (They also say that) siwak is an act of worship and drawing closer to Allah, so it should not be done with the left hand. Other scholars say that it is better to use the left hand for siwak, because it comes under the heading of removing dirt. This is the well-known opinion of Imam Ahmad’s madhhab, and it is the view favoured by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, may Allah have mercy on him. Some scholars have said that when a person is using siwak with the intention of following the sunnah, he should use his right hand, and if he is doing it to remove dirt, he should use his left hand. The fact of the matter is that this issue is open, as there is no definitive evidence or report, and every opinion has a valid point. The jurists suggested that when using siwak, a person should start on the right, and use a side-to-side motion rather than up-and-down, as the latter may harm the gums. Etiquette of using siwak Among the etiquette of using siwak, they mentioned the following: That a person should not use the siwak in front of others or in public, because this is impolite. That the siwak should be washed after use, to get rid of any dirt that may be on it. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to use siwak, then he would give it to me to wash it. I would use it first, then wash it and give it back to him. (Reported by Abu Dawud, 1/45). The siwak should be kept in a clean place. Using one's fingers to clean one's mouth The scholars differ as to whether it is acceptable to use one's fingers to clean one's mouth when there is nothing else available. The correct view is that using the fingers cannot be considered as a substitute for the sunnah action, because there is no basis in Islam for doing so, and this method does not clean the mouth as a siwak or similar instrument does. Modern methods of cleaning the teeth, like toothbrushes and so on, that remove dirt and make the mouth smell good, are acceptable. There is nothing wrong with using siwak that is flavoured with mint, lemon and so on, so long as they do not cause any harm. But a person who is fasting should avoid using any flavoured siwak, and should only use natural siwak when he is fasting. And Allah knows best.

      "Praise be to Allah.We cannot conceal our joy and pleasure at the intention expressed in your question of embracing the true religion, Islam. The confusion and hesitation that you describe are quite understandable, because when a person has been indulging in forbidden relationships and then wishes to move to a religion of purity and chastity, it is natural to feel that his own nafs (desires) will defeat him and that he will not be able to do what Islam requires of him in the way of purity and chastity. But we will tell you some things here which we hope will help you to overcome any difficulty that you may be fearing and give a true picture of the situation. When a person follows the true religion, it is expected to have a far-reaching effect on his personality and behaviour, so that it re-forms him and gives him a fresh start and a new direction in life, completely different from the way he was during his jaahiliyyah (days of ignorance before his Islam). This radical change will produce morals and values that were not there before, which will purify his heart and fill him with a sense of chastity, so that the new Muslim looks with revulsion and disgust both at his own former deeds and at the ignorant world of promiscuity, infidelity, nakedness and utter corruption that exists in the society around him. He will come back to the sound nature (fitrah the natural state of man) and purity of heart of which Shaytaan had robbed him during the days when he was a non-Muslim and sinner. This new direction in life is undertaken freely, by choice, and is accompanied by contentment and acceptance stemming from his total submission to the commands and prohibitions of Allaah, Who revealed this religion of Islam with all its laws. We have two sources of proof to support what we say here, one from the shareeah (Islamic law)and one from history. The shari(textual) evidence is to be found in numerous places in the Quraan, for example (interpretation of the meanings): Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and by disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and by faith) and set for him a light (of Belief) whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out? [al-Anaam 6:122] And those who invoke not any other god along with Allaah, nor kill such life as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace, Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds, for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Furqaan 25:68-70] Concerning the phrase Allaah will change their sins into good deeds the mufassireen (commentators) said: their evil deeds will be replaced by good deeds. Ali ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn Abbaas said: These are the believers, who before they believed did evil deeds, but Allaah wanted them to do something else, so He changed their bad deeds into good deeds Ataa ibn Abi Rabaah said: This is in this world: a man may be doing evil but then Allaah replaces it with good. Saeed ibn Jubayr said: Allaah changed them from worshippers of idols into worshippers of the Most Merciful, and changed them from those who fight the Muslims into those who fight the (polytheists), and from those who marry mushrik (polytheist)women into those who marry believing women. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: Allaah changed them from evil deeds to good deeds, from shirk (polytheism) to ikhlaas (purity of faith), from promiscuity to chastity, from disbelief to Islam. This is the view of Abu Aaliyah, Qutaadah and a group of others. (Ibn Katheer, Tafseer al-Quraan al-Azeem). The historical evidence includes a number of stories of Muslims who entered Islam after having been (disbelievers), and how they changed and became righteous. Among these stories is the following: There was a (Muslim) man called Marthad ibn Abi Marthad who used to smuggle Muslim prisoners-of-war from Makkah (which was the territory of the mushrikeen) to Madeenah (which was the territory of the Muslims). There was also a woman in Makkah, called Anaaq, who was a prostitute. She had been a friend of Marthads (before he became Muslim). Marthad had promised to take one of the prisoners from Makkah to Madeenah. He said: I came to the shade of one of the gardens of Makkah on a moonlit night, then Anaaq came and saw my shadow by the garden. When she reached me, she recognized me and said: Marthad? I said, Marthad. She said: Welcome! Stay with us tonight. I said, O Anaaq, Allaah has forbidden zinaa (unlawful sexual relations). She called out, O people of the camp! This man is stealing away your prisoners! (i.e., she wanted to take revenge on him because he refused to have unlawful relations with her, so she called the polytheists to come and seize him). Eight men pursued me (and he described how Allaah saved him from them). This event was the reason for the revelation of the verse (interpretation of the meaning): Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an Unbeliever marry such a woman; to the Believers such a thing is forbidden. [al-Noor 24:3 Yusuf Alis translation] (Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, 3101). The reason for telling this story is that it illustrates how this man changed after he embraced Islam, and refused to commit the haraam deed with which he was tempted. Another story describes a woman who embraced Islam and became righteous: Abd-Allaah ibn Maghfal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: Stop it! (Mah! A word connoting a rebuke or denunciation). Allaah has done away with polytheism and had brought Islam. So he left her alone and went away. (Reported by al-Haakim, who said this hadeeth is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim, although they did not report it). If you enter Islam and become a truly practicsing Muslim, adhering to this pure shareeah, worshipping Allaah(God willing) as He wants to be worshipped, obeying His commands and heeding His prohibitions, then in sha Allaah you will not encounter or suffer the difficulties you refer to in your question. Moreover, you will have the means of keeping chaste, such as marriage, which will help you to refrain from doing unlawful deeds; marriage is enjoined by this shareeah. The one who chooses a pure and clean way has no need to enter the mire (of illicit relationships). We ask Allaah to guide you and make things easy for you, and to keep evil away from you. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There follows an explanation of the issue of vows, describing different kinds of vows and the basic rules concerning them, so that you and other readers may benefit from this information, in sha Allaah. Al-Isfahaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) says, in his book Mufradaat Alfaaz al-Qur’aan (Vocabulary of the Qur’aan), p. 797: “Al-Nadhr (vow): when you oblige yourself to do something that is not obligatory because of something that you want to happen. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘[Maryam said:] I have vowed a fast unto the Most Beneficent (Allaah)…’ [Maryam 19:26].” So a vow is the action, on the part of a person who is adult and of sound mind (mukallaf), of obliging himself to do something that is not obligatory, whether he intends to do it straight away or makes his doing it conditional upon something else. Vows are mentioned in the Qur’aan in approving terms. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the abraar (pious, who fear Allaah and avoid evil), shall drink a cup (of wine) mixed with water from a spring in Paradise called Kaafoor, a spring wherefrom the slaves of Allaah will drink, causing it to gush forth abundantly. They (are those who) fulfil their vows, and they fear a Day whose evil will be widespreading.” [al-Dahr 76:5-7]. So Allaah makes their fear of the horrors of the Day of Resurrection and their fulfilment of their vows some of the reasons for their salvation and admittance to Paradise. Ruling on vows. Fulfilling legitimate (shar’i) vows is obligatory according to sharee’ah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Then let them complete the prescribed duties (manaasik of Hajj) for them, and perform their vows…” [al-Hajj 22:29]. Imaam al-Shawkaani said: “This means that they have to do this.” Numerous ahaadeeth have been reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) discouraging vows and describing them as makrooh. Abu Hurayrah said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Do not make vows, for vows do not change qadar (the divine decree) in the slightest, but they make the stingy person give something up.’” (Reported by Muslim). ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) began to discourage us from making vows, and said, ‘They do not change anything, although they may make the miser give up something.’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). One might ask, how is it that those who fulfil their vows are praised, then making vows is discouraged? The answer is that the kind of vow that is praised is the vow to do acts of worship that are not connected to anything – i.e., not conditional upon anything – which makes a man force himself to do acts of worship and prevent himself from being lazy, or in thanksgiving for some blessing. The kinds of vow which are discouraged are of different types, including vows that are made in return for something, whereby a person makes his doing an act of worship conditional upon attaining something or warding off something, and if that does not happen, he does not do the act of worship. This is what is discouraged, perhaps for the following reasons: because then the person who made the vow would be doing the act of worship reluctantly, because it has become something he cannot avoid or get out of. Because when the person making the vow makes the act of worship conditional upon his getting what he wants, his vow becomes a kind of exchange or barter which corrupts his intention; if the sick person is not cured, he will not give the charity which he vowed to give if the sick person was healed. This is miserliness, because the miser will not give anything except for something in return in this life (as opposed to the Hereafter), and what he gains is more than what he gives. Some people ignorantly believe that making a vow guarantees that they will get whatever they made the vow for, or that Allaah will make it happen for them because of the vow. Another ignorant belief is the idea that making a vow can change qadaa’ (the divine decree), or that it can bring them some immediate benefit or ward off some harm. So vows were discouraged lest ignorant people believe such things, and as a warning of the danger that such attitudes present to sound belief. Types of vows and their fulfilment 1 - Vows which must be fulfilled (vows to do acts of worship and obedience to Allaah) This includes every vow which involves a promise to do some kind of act of worship, such as praying, fasting, performing ‘Umrah or Hajj, upholding family ties, doing I’tikaaf (retreat for worship in the mosque), jihaad, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. For example, a person may say, “It is my duty towards Allaah to fast such-and-such (days)” or to give such-and-such in charity, or to go for Hajj this year, or to pray two rak’ahs in al-Masjid al-Haraam [in Makkah] in thanksgiving to Allaah for curing a sick person. Or he may make a vow of doing some act of worship conditional upon something that will benefit him if it happens, so he says, “If my absent loved one returns or Allaah protects me from the evil of my enemy, I will fast such-and-such (days) or give such-and-such in charity.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allaah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6202). If a man vows to do some act of worship then circumstances change and prevent him from fulfilling his vow, such as he vows to fast for a month or to go for Hajj or ‘Umrah, then he falls sick and is unable to fast or travel, or he vows to give charity, then he becomes poor and is unable to give what he promised, then in such cases he must offer expiation (kafaarah) for breaking his vow, which is the same as kafaarat yameen (expiation for breaking an oath). Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said, “Whoever makes a vow and is then unable to fulfil it, his expiation is kafaarat yameen.” (Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in Buloogh al-Maraam, Its isnaad is saheeh, and some huffaaz thought it was mawqoof.). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fataawa (33/49): “If a man intends to vow to do some act of worship and obedience to Allaah, then he must fulfil it. If he does not fulfil his vow to Allaah, then he must offer kafaarat yameen, according to the majority of the salaf (early generations of Islam).” 2 - Vows which it is forbidden to fulfil, and for which kafaarat yameen must be offered This includes different types of vows: Vows to commit sin: This is every vow which involves disobedience to Allaah, such as vows to bring oil, candles or money to graves or shrines (mashhads), or to visit tombs and shrines of shirk. This is in some ways like making vows to idols. It is also forbidden to fulfil vows which promise to do some sin, like committing zinaa (adultery, fornication), drinking alcohol, stealing, taking orphans’ property, denying someone’s rights, or cutting family ties by cutting a certain relative off or not entering his house for no shar’i reason. All of these are not permitted at all, and (the person who makes such a vow) must offer kafaarat yameen in expiation for his vow. The evidence (daleel) that it is not permissible to fulfil this kind of vow is the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever vows to do some act of worship and obedience to Allaah, then let him do it, and whoever vows to do some sin, let him not do it.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). ‘Imraan ibn Husayn reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be no fulfilment of a vow to commit sin.” (Reported by Muslim, 3099). Vows that go against a shar’i text (of the Qur’aan or Sunnah) If a Muslim makes a vow then it becomes clear to him that this vow of his goes against a clear, saheeh text that contains some command or prohibition, then he must refrain from fulfilling his vow, and offer kafaarat yameen for it. The evidence for this is the report of al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) from Ziyaad ibn Jubayr, who said: “I was with Ibn ‘Umar and a man asked him, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday as long as I live, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr (the Day of Sacrifice, i.e., the first day of Eid al-Adha).’ He said, ‘Allaah has commanded us to fulfil vows and we are forbidden to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ He repeated this to him, and said no more and no less.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 6212). Imaam Ahmad reported that Ziyaad ibn Jubayr said: “A man asked Ibn ‘Umar, whilst he was walking in Mina, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr, so what do you think?’ He said, ‘Allaah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfil our vows, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us [or he said: we were forbidden] to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ The man thought that he had not heard him properly, so he said, ‘I made a vow to fast every Tuesday or Wednesday, and it so happens that this day is Yawm al-Nahr.’ [Ibn ‘Umar] said, ‘Allaah, may He be exalted, has commanded us to fulfil our vows, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us [or he said: we were forbidden] to fast on Yawm al-Nahr.’ They kept repeating this exchange until they reached the mountain.” Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: “The scholars agree that it is not permitted to fast on Yawm al-Fitr and Yawm al-Nahr, neither as an act of worship nor in fulfilment of a vow.” 3 – Vows concerning which there is no ruling other than kafaarat yameen There are some vows concerning which there is no ruling other than that the one who makes such a vow must offer kafaarat yameen in expiation for his vow. These include: - Non-specific vows If a Muslim makes a vow but does not specify what the vow is about, such as saying, “I make a vow if Allaah heals this sick person” – but does not specify anything, then he must offer kafaarat yameen. ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The expiation for a vow is kafaarat yameen.” (Reported by Muslim). Imaam al-Nawawi said: “Maalik and many others – indeed the majority – interpreted this as meaning absolute vows, such as saying ‘I vow’ [without being specific].” (Sharh Muslim li’l-Nawawi, 11/104). - Vows concerning things that one does not possess. If a person makes a vow concerning something that is not his, then he has no option but to offer kafaarat yameen. For example, if he vows to give charity from someone else’s wealth, or to free someone else’s slave, or to give a garden that he does not own to someone. The evidence for this ruling is the hadeeth of ‘Amr ibn Shu’ayb from his father from his grandfather, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The son of Adam cannot make any vow concerning that which is not his, he cannot free (any slave) who is not his, and he cannot divorce any wife who is not his.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1101. He said: The hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr is a saheeh hasan hadeeth). 4 – Vows where one has the option of fulfilling the vow or of offering kafaarat yameen There are vows where a person has the option of fulfilling the vow or of offering kafaarat yameen. This kind of vow includes: - Vows made in desperation or in anger: This means every vow that comes in the form of an oath made to urge for something to be done or to stop something from being done, or to swear that something is true or not true, where the person does not really intend to make a vow to do some act of worship. For example, a man might say in anger, ‘If I ever do such-and-such I have to go for Hajj, or fast for a month, or give one thousand dinars in charity’ or, ‘If I ever speak to So-and-so I have to free a slave, or divorce my wife,’ and so on, then he does the thing he said he would not do, but all he really meant by his words was that he would not do that thing – he had no intention of either doing it or the thing he vowed to do if he did. In such a case, this person – who made the vow for argument’s sake or to express the urgency of doing or refraining from something – has the choice of either fulfilling the vow, or expiating for it by offering kafaarat yameen, because his vow was essentially an oath (yameen). Ibn Taymiyah said: “If a vow is made in the form of an oath, such as saying, ‘If I travel with you then I have to go for Hajj, or give all my wealth in charity, or free a slave,’ in the opinion of the Sahaabah and the majority of the scholars this is hilf al-nadhr (an oath by vowing), it is not a vow. If he does not do what he promised to do, it is sufficient for him to offer kafaarat yameen.” Elsewhere, he said, “The obligation of vows made in anger or desperation is one of two things, according to the majority: either expiation, or doing the thing promised. If he does not fulfil the vow, he must offer expiation (kafaarah).” - Vows concerning permissible things. This means every vow that includes permissible things, such as vowing to wear a certain type of clothes, eat special foods, ride a certain animal, enter a certain house, and so on. Thaabit ibn al-Dahhaak said: “A man vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawaanah (according to one report: because a male child had been born to him). He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: ‘I have vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawaanah.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Was there one of the idols of the Jaahiliyyah there that people used to worship?’ They said, ‘No.’ He asked, ‘Did they used to celebrate any of their festivals there?’ They said, ‘No.’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Then fulfil your vow, for there is no fulfilment of vows that involve disobedience to Allaah, or that concern things that the son of Adam does not possess.’” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 2881). This man had vowed to sacrifice a camel in Bawaanah (a place beyond Yanboo’) in thanksgiving to Allaah, may He be exalted, because He had blessed him with a male child. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) allowed him to fulfil his vow, so he sacrificed a camel in that place. We ask Allaah to help us to do that which He loves and will please Him. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves” [al-‘Ankabut 29:40] What to do at times of earthquakes What Muslims and others who are accountable and of sound mind must do is repent to Allah, adhere firmly to His Religion and avoid all that He has forbidden of Shirk and sin, so that they may be safe and attain salvation from all evils in this world and the next, and so that Allah will ward off from them all harm, and bless them with all good.

Or, did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing? Did they then feel secure against the Plan of Allah? None feels secure from the Plan of Allah except the people who are the losers.” [al-A’raf 7:97-99] Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Allah sometimes gives the earth permission to breathe, which is when major earthquakes happen; this makes people feel scared, so they repent, give up sins, pray to Allah and feel regret [for their sins]. When there had been an earthquake, some of the Salaf said: your Lord is warning you. When Madinah was struck by an earthquake, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with you) addressed the people and said: if there is another earthquake, I will not stay here with you.” And there are many similar reports from the Salaf. Our response when there is an earthquake or some other sign such as an eclipse, strong winds or floods, should be to hasten to repent to Allah and pray to Him for safety, and to remember Him much and seek His forgiveness, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said when there was an eclipse: “If you see anything like that, hasten to remember Him, call on Him and seek His forgiveness.” (Part of an agreed-upon hadith narrated by al-Bukhari (2/30) and Muslim (2/628)) It is also mustahabb (recommended, encouraged) to show compassion to the poor and needy, and to give charity to them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Show mercy, you will be shown mercy.” (Narrated by Imam Ahmad, 2/165) “Those who are merciful will be shown mercy by the Most Merciful. Have mercy on those who are on earth, and the One Who is in heaven will show mercy to you.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud (13/285), al-Tirmidhi (6/43)). “Whoever does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari (5/75), Muslim (4/1809)) It was reported that when there was an earthquake , `Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Aziz (may Allah have mercy on him) would write to his governors telling them to give in charity. One of the things which will help to keep people safe and sound is if the authorities impose an immediate crack-down on the foolish elements in society, forcing them to behave and applying the laws of Shari`ah to them, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The believers, men and women, are Awliya (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); they perform As-Salah (Iqamat-as-Salah), and give the Zakah, and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah will have His Mercy on them. Surely, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Tawbah 9:71] “Verily, Allah will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allah is All-Strong, All-Mighty. Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat-as-Salah [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salah (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakah and they enjoin Al-Ma‘ruf (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Quran as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allah rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures).” [al-Hajj 22:40-41] “And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.” [al-Talaq 65:2-3] And there are many verses on this topic. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever meets the needs of his brother, Allah will meet his needs.” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhaari, 3/98; Muslim, 4/1996) And he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever relieves a believer of some of the distress of this world, Allah will relieve him of some of the distress of the Day of Resurrection. Whoever makes things easier for one who is suffering hardship, Allah will make things easier for him in this world and in the Hereafter. Whoever conceals a Muslim’s faults, Allah will conceal his faults in this world and in the Hereafter. Allah will help a person so long as he helps his brother.” (Narrated by Muslim, 4/2074) And there are many hadiths on this topic. Allah is the One Whom we ask to reform the affairs of all the Muslims and to bless them with proper understanding of Islam and help them to adhere steadfastly to it and repent to Allah from all their sins. We ask Him to reform all those who are in authority over the Muslims’ affairs and to support the Truth and eradicate falsehood through them, and to help them to rule the people according to the laws of Shari`ah, and to protect them and all the Muslims from misguidance and temptation and the tricks of the Shaytan, for He is Able to do all that. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This is a question which needs a very long answer, but we will summarize it as follows: Firstly, the names of Allaah are not limited to any specific number. We know some of them and do not know others, as is indicated by the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘There is no one among you who, when he is stricken with distress and grief, says, “Allaahumma inni ‘abduka wabnu ‘abdika wabnu amatika naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka. As’aluka bi kull ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghayb ‘indaka an taj’al al-Qur’aana rabee’a qalbi wa noora sadri wa jilaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi [O Allaah, I am Your slave, sone of Your slave and son of Your maidservant, my forelock is in Your hand. Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You named Yourself with, or You taught to any of Your creation, or revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You nmake the Qur’aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety]” – but Allaah will remove his distress and his grief, and will give him joy instead…” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 3582; it is a saheeh hadeeth). Secondly, The names of Allaah are all husnaa [Most Beautiful], as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do.” [al-A’raaf 7:180] The meaning of al-husnaa implies the utmost beauty, and that each name includes the quality of perfection. Al-‘Allaamah ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Naasir ibn Sa’di (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Many of the names of Allaah have been mentioned in the Qur’aan, according to the context, but we also need to point out their broader meanings, so we say: The name Rabb (Lord, Cherisher) is repeated in many aayaat. The Rabb is the One Who guides and cares for all of His slaves by managing their affairs and bestowing different kinds of blessings. In a more specific sense, He cares for and guides His friends (devoted slaves) by reforming and setting straight their hearts and souls and attitudes. For this reason, many of their du’aa’s or prayers to Him address Him by this glorious Name, because they are asking Him for this specific kind of care. The name Allaah refers to the One Who is adored and worshipped, the One Who possesses the attributes of divinity and to whom all His creation is enslaved. The attributes of divinity with which He describes Himself are the attributes of perfection. Al-Malik (the Sovereign), al-Maalik (the Possessor), Alladhi lahu’l-Mulk (the One to Whom Dominion belongs). Allaah is the One Who is described with the attributes of sovereignty and dominion, which are the qualities of might and pride, subjugation and control. He is the One Who is in absolute control of creation, Who issues commands and Who rewards or punishes. The entire Universe, high and low, belongs to Him. All of them are His servants and slaves, and are utterly dependent on Him. Al-Waahid (the One), al-Ahad (the Unique). He is the One Who is uniquely and utterly and perfectly One, with no partners in His Uniqueness. His slaves are obliged to believe in His Oneness, in belief and word and deed, by recognizing that He is absolutely perfect and is unique in His oneness, and by directing all kinds of worship to Him Alone. Al-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, He neither eats nor drinks). He is the One to Whom all of creation turns for all of their needs, for He is in and of Himself absolutely perfect, in His Names and Attributes and Deeds. Al-‘Aleem (the All-Knowing), al-Khabeer (the Aware). He is the One Whose Knowledge encompasses all things, seen and unseen, secret and open, everything that is inevitable or impossible or possible, in heaven and on earth, the past, the present and the future. Nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him. Al-Hakeem (the Wise). He is the One Who has ultimate wisdom, in His creation and in His commands. He is the One Who created everything well. “… And who is better in judgement than Allaah for a people who have firm Faith.” [al-Maa’idah 5:50 – interpretation of the meaning]. He does not create anything in vain, or legislate anything in jest. He is the One Who has Dominion in this world and the next. His ruling applies in three major spheres, in which none else has any share with Him: He judges between His slaves by means of His Law, His decree and His reward/punishment. Wisdom: He puts things in their rightful places and gives them their rightful status. Al-Rahman (the Most Gracious), al-Raheem (the Most Merciful), al-Barr (the Source of Goodness), al-Kareem (the Most Generous), al-Jawaad (the Generous), al-Ra’oof (the Compassionate), al-Wahhaab (the Bestower). These names are all close in meaning, and they all indicate that the Rabb is characterized by mercy, goodness, and generosity. They testify to the vastness of His mercy and other attributes, with which He encompasses all of His creation to the extent that His wisdom decrees, although the greater share is bestowed upon the believers in particular. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… My Mercy encompasses all things. That (Mercy) I shall ordain for those who are the Muttaqoon (pious)…” [al-A’raaf 7:156] Blessings and goodness are all traces of His Mercy and Generosity. The good things of this world and the next are all traces of His Mercy. Al-Samee’ (the All-Hearing). He hears all voices, in all the different languages, no matter how many and how varied, when they call on Him for their needs. Al-Baseer (the All-Seeing) Who has insight into all things, not matter how small. He can see a black ant walking across the face of a rock on the darkest night. He can see what is below the seven levels of the earth and what is above the seven heavens. He is the All-Hearing and All-Seeing, Who knows who is deserving of reward or punishment according to His Wisdom. Al-Hameed (the Praiseworthy), Who is inherently deserving of praise, by His Names, Attributes and deeds. He has the Most Beautiful Names, the most perfect attributes and the most perfect and beautiful deeds. His actions always revolve around munificence and justice. Al-Majeed (the Most Glorious), al-Kabeer (the Most Great), al-‘Azeem (the Most Great), al-Jaleel (the Sublime One). These Names describe Allaah with attributes of glory, pride, greatness and majesty. He is greater than everything, more mighty, more majestic and more exalted. To Him belong glorification and exaltation in the hearts of His close friends and devoted slaves, whose hearts are filled with veneration of His might and humble submission to His glory. Al-‘Afuw (the Pardoner), al-‘Ghafoor (the Forgiver), al-Ghaffaar (the All-Forgiving), Who has always been and will always be known for His pardon and forgiveness towards His slaves. Everyone is in need of His pardon and forgiveness, as they are in need of His mercy and generosity. He has promised to forgive and pardon whoever follows the appropriate means. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And verily, I am indeed Forgiving to him who repents, believes (in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me) and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them (till his death).” [Ta-Ha 20:82] Al-Tawwaab (the Acceptor of Repentance). He always accepts the repentance of those who repent and forgives the sins of those who commit sin. Allaah accepts the repentance of everyone who repents to Him sincerely. He is the One Who forgives those who repent, firstly by helping them to repent and causing their hearts to turn towards Him. After they repent, He turns to them and accepts their repentance, pardoning their sins. Al-Quddoos (the Holy) and al-Salaam (the One Free from all defects). Allaah is far above any attribute of imperfection, and He is above being likened to any of His creation. “… There is nothing like unto Him…” [al-Shoora 42:11] “And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.” [al-Ikhlaas 112:4] “… Do you know of any who is similar to Him?…” [Maryam 19:65] “… Then do not set up rivals unto Allaah (in worship)…” [al-Baqarah 2:22] The names al-Quddoos and al-Salaam reject the idea that He could be lacking in any way, and they imply that He is absolutely perfect in all aspects, because once the idea of imperfection is rejected, this is proof of total perfection. Al-‘Aliyy (the Exalted), al-A’laa (the Most High). He is the One Who is completely exalted in all aspects, in His essence, in His status, in His attributes and in His dominion. He is the One Who rose over the Throne and Who dominates all things. In all the attributes of might, pride, glory and beauty that are ascribed to Him, He reaches the ultimate level. Al-‘Azeez (the Almighty), to whom belong all might and power, the power of strength, the power of dominion, the power of invincibility. None of His creatures can harm Him. He has subjugated all that exists, and the whole of creation is under His control and is subject to His might. Al-Qawiy (the Most Strong), al-Mateen (the Firm One). The meanings of these Names are similar to the meaning of al-‘Azeez. Al-Jabbaar (the Compeller). This Names includes the meanings of al-‘Aliyy, al-A’laa and al-Qahhaar. Al-Ra’oof (the Compassionate) means the One Who consoles broken hearts and supports the weak and those who seek His help and turn to Him. Al-Mutakabbir (the Majestic) is the One Who is above all bad qualities, shortcomings and faults, because of His might and pride. Al-Khaaliq (the Creator), al-Baari’ (the Inventor of all things), al-Musawwir (the Bestower of forms). He is the One Who has created from nothing all that exists, and formed it by His wisdom, praise be to Him. He has always been and will always be known by this mighty attribute. Al-Mu’min (the Guardian of Faith), Who is praised for His own sake by His perfect attributes, and by the perfection of His majesty and beauty. He sent His Messengers and revealed His Books with signs and proofs, and confirmed His Messengers with signs and proofs, to confirm the truth of the message they brought. Al-Muhaymin (the Watcher over His creatures) Who is aware of everything that is hidden and concealed, and Whose knowledge encompasses all things. Al-Qadeer (the Powerful), Whose power is perfect. By His power He created all things that exist, by His power He is controlling all things and by His power He formed them and perfected them. By His power He gives life and death, and will resurrect His slaves to receive their reward or punishment, so that those who have done well will be rewarded with good, and those who have done evil will be punished. When Allaah wills a thing, He merely says “Be!” and it is. By His power He controls people’s hearts, and He directs them as He wills. Al-Lateef (the Most Subtle and Courteous), Whose knowledge encompasses everything that is hidden and concealed. He knows everything that is secret and understands the most subtle things. He is Kind to His believing slaves and takes care of their interests by His benevolence and grace, in many ways that they are not even aware of. This Name also shares the meanings of al-Khabeer and al-Ra’oof. Al-Haseeb (the One Who takes account). He is the One Who is All-Knowing about His slaves. He is Sufficient for those who put their trust in Him, and He rewards or punishes His slaves for good and evil, according to His wisdom. He knows about all their deeds, major and minor. Al-Raqeeb (the Watchful). He is the One Who watches what is hidden in people’s hearts. “… He Who takes charge of every person and knows all that he has earned” [al-Ra’d 13:33 – interpretation of the meaning]. He protected His creation and set it in motion, running according to the most perfect system and controls. Al-Hafeez (the Preserver). He is the One Who protects what He has created and encompasses it with His knowledge. He protects His close friends from falling into sin and destruction, and gently protects them when they are active and when they are at rest. He counts the deeds of His slaves and rewards or punishes them accordingly. Al-Muheet (the Encompasser). He is the One Who encompasses all things with His knowledge, power, mercy and dominion. Al-Qahhaar (the Subduer). He is the Subduer of all things, to Whom all of creation submits because of His power and strength and the perfection of His Might. Al-Muqeet (the Provider of sustenance). He gives provision to everything that exists and directs the affairs of all as He wills. Al-Wakeel (the Trustee). He is the One Who is in a position to run the affairs of His creation, by His knowledge and the perfection of His power and His encompassing wisdom. He is the One Who is taking care of His close friends, making the right way easy for them and causing them to steer clear of the wrong way. He is taking care of all their affairs, and whoever puts his trust in Him will find that He is Sufficient for him. “Allaah is the Walee (Protector or Guardian) of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light…” [al-Baqarah 2:257 – interpretation of the meaning]. Dhoo’l-Jalaali wa’l-Ikraam (Possessor of Majesty and Honour), i.e., the Possessor of Might and Pride, the Possessor of Mercy and Generosity, Who is kind to everyone and to specific individuals. He honours His close friends and devoted worshippers who glorify Him, extol His greatness and love Him. Al-Wudood (the Loving). He loves His Prophets and Messengers and their followers, and they love Him. He is dearer to them than everything else. He has filled their hearts with love for Him and their tongues utter words of praise to Him. Their hearts are drawn to Him in love and sincerity and they turn in repentance to Him at all times. Al-Fattaah (the Opener). He judges between His slaves according to His laws, His decrees and His decisions concerning reward and punishment. By His Grace He opens the eyes of those who are sincere, and opens their hearts to know Him, love Him and turn to Him in repentance. He opens the door to all kinds of mercy and provision for His slaves, and generates the causes by means of which they can earn good things in this world and the next. “Whatever of mercy (i.e., good) Allaah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter…” Faatir 35:2 – interpretation of the meaning] Al-Razzaaq (the Provider), Who provides for all His slaves. There is no living creature on earth, but Allaah provides for it. His provision for His slaves is of two types: General provision, which include the righteous and immoral, the first and the last. This is the provision of physical needs. Specific provision, which is provision for the heart which is nourished with knowledge and faith, and the halaal provision which helps a person to adhere to religion. This provision is specifically for the believers, and is given to varying degrees according to His wisdom and mercy. Al-Hakam (the Judge), al-‘Adl (the Just). He judges between His slaves in this world and the next, with His justice and fairness. He does not oppress anyone in the slightest, and no one is made to bear the burden of another person’s sin. He does not punish a person more than he deserves for his sin, he restores to people their rights and does not leave anyone without restoring what is his right. He is just in His running of the universe and in His decision making. “… Verily, My Lord is on a Straight Path (the truth)…” [Hood 11:56 – interpretation of the meaning]. Jaami’ al-Naas (Gatherer of the People). He will gather all of mankind on the Day concerning which there is no doubt. He has comprehensive knowledge of their deeds and their provision, and there is nothing, major or minor, that He is not aware of. He will gather every particle of their bodies that has disappeared or been changed into something else, of all the people who have died from the earliest times until the latest times, by the perfection of His power and the vastness of His knowledge. Al-Hayy (the Ever-Living), al-Qayyoom (the Self-Sustaining). He is completely alive and sustains Himself, and He sustains and cares for the people of heaven and earth. He controls their affairs and provides for them. The name al-Hayy encompasses all the qualities of His essence and the name al-Qayyoom encompasses all the qualities of His deeds. Al-Noor (the Light). He is the Light of the heavens and of the earth, Who enlightens the hearts of the ‘aarifeen (those who have proper knowledge of Him) with knowledge of Him and fills their hearts with the light of His guidance. He is the One Who illuminates the heavens and the earth with the lights that He has placed therein. His veil is Light and if it were to be removed, everything of His creation as far as He can see would be burnt, may He be glorified. Badee’ al-Samawaati wa’l-Ard (Originator of the heavens and the earth). He is the One Who created them and formed them with the utmost beauty and with the most magnificent system of organization. Al-Qaabid (the Constrictor), al-Baasit (the Expander). He is the One Who takes people’s souls, and Who provides them with ample provision and expands their hearts. All of this is in accordance with His Wisdom and Mercy. Al-Mu’ti (the Giver), al-Maani’ (the Withholder). No-one can withhold what He gives, and no one can give what He withholds. All interests and benefits are sought from Him, and the needs of all are addressed to Him. He is the One Who gives them to whomever He wills and withholds them from whomever He wills, by His Wisdom and Mercy. Al-Shaheed (the Witness). He is the One Who watches over all things and hears all voices, loud and soft. He sees all that exists, great and small alike. His knowledge encompasses all things, and He is the Witness Who sees all the deeds of His slaves, good and bad alike. Al-Mubdi’ (the Originator), al-Mu’eed (the Restorer). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And it is He Who originates the creation, then will repeat (after it has perished)…” [al-Room 30:27] He initiated their creation, in order to test them as to which of them would be best in deeds, then He will re-create them in order to reward with good those who did well, and punish those who did evil. He is the One Who initiated His creation in stages, and Who is constantly renewing it. Al-Fa’’aal lima yureed (the One Who does whatever He wants). This has to do with the perfection of His power and the strength of His will and ability. Everything He wants, He does, with nothing to stop Him and no one to oppose Him, and with no support or help, no matter what it is. If He wants something, all he has to do is say “Be!” and it is. Although He can do whatever He wants, His will operates in conjunction with His Wisdom, may He be praised, so He is described as being completely Able and being Strong of will, but also as being completely Wise in all that He has done and will do. Al-Ghaniy (the Self-Sufficient), al-Mughni (the Enricher). He is independent in and of Himself, and is completely Independent in all aspects, because of His perfection and the perfection of His attributes. Nothing can undermine His perfection and make Him imperfect in any way whatsoever. He cannot be anything but Self-Sufficient, because this self-sufficiency is one of His essential qualities, just as He cannot be anything but the Creator, the Able, the Provider, the Kind, Who does not need anyone else at all. He is the Self-Sufficient in Whose hands are the treasures of the heavens and the earth, the treasures of this world and of the Hereafter. He gives His creation enough in general terms so that they do not have to seek help of anyone else, and He gives to specific people of the divine knowledge and realities of faith with which He has filled their hearts. Al-Haleem (the Forbearing One). He is the One Who showers His creation with blessings both apparent and hidden, in spite of their sins and many mistakes. He is Forbearing and does not punish sinners straight away for their sins. He rebukes them so that they will repent, and gives them time to turn to Him in repentance. Al-Shaakir (the Grateful), al-Shakoor (the Appreciative). He is the One Who appreciates the smallest deed, and forgives the greatest mistakes. He multiplies beyond measure the deeds of those who are sincere; He appreciates those who give thanks to Him, and He remembers those who remember Him. Whoever draws near to Him with something of righteous deeds, He draws near to him by more than that. Al-Qareeb (the Ever-Near), al-Mujeeb (the Responsive). Allaah, may He be glorified, is near to everyone, and His nearness is of two types: His nearness to everyone in a general sense, through His knowledge, watching, awareness and witnessing, which encompass all things. His nearness in a specific sense, to His slaves, those who ask help of Him and those who love Him. The true nature of this closeness cannot be understood, but its effects may be seen in His kindness towards His slave, and His care, support and help of him. Another of its effects is His response to those who call on Him and His acceptance of the repentance of those who worship Him. He is also the One Who responds in a specific way to those who respond to Him and follow His religion. He also responds to those who are in need and to those who no longer have any hope in any of His creation, and who put their trust in Him, hoping for His pleasure and fearing His wrath. Al-Kaafi (the Sufficient). He is the One Who gives His slaves all that they need. More specifically, He is Sufficient for the one who believes in Him and puts his trust in Him and asks Him for all that he needs in worldly and spiritual terms. Al-Awwal (the First), al-Aakhir (the Last); al-Zaahir (the Manifest), al-Baatin (the Hidden). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained this in a clear and comprehensive fashion when he said, addressing his Lord: “You are the First, and there is nothing before You; You are the Last, and there is nothing after You. You are the Manifest and there is nothing above You; You are the Hidden and there is nothing beneath You.” Al-Waasi’ (the All-Encompassing). His attributes and qualities, and everything that has to do with Him, are all-encompassing in such a way that no one can praise Him as He deserves, but He is as He praised Himself, vast in power, might and dominion, and vast in grace and kindness, and vast in generosity and munificence. Al-Haadi (the Guide), al-Rasheed (the Guide to the Right Path). He is the One Who guides His slaves and shows them the way to all that will benefit them, and protects them from all that will harm them. He teaches them what they do not know, and guides them to the true guidance which will help them and set them straight. He fills them with taqwa (piety) and causes their hearts to turn to Him, in response to His command. The name al-Rasheed has a meaning akin to that of al-Hakeem: He is Wise in word and deed, and all His laws are good and wise. His creation testifies to His wisdom. Al-Haqq (the Truth). He is true in and of Himself and in His attributes. His existence is undeniable, and His attributes are perfect. His existence is one of His essential qualities (He cannot but exist), and nothing else can exist except through Him. He is the One Who has always been and will always be described with attributes of majesty, beauty and perfection. He has always been and will always be known for His Kindness. His words are truth; the meeting with Him is truth; His Messengers are truth; His Books are truth; His religion is the Truth; the worship of Him Alone, with no partners or associates, is the Truth; everything that has to do with Him is truth. Allaah is the Truth and whatever else they claim to be divine besides Him is false. Allaah is the Most High, the Most Great, as He says (interpretation of the meanings): “And say: ‘The Truth is from your Lord.’ Then whosoever wills, let him believe, and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve…” [al-Isra’ 18:29]. “… So, after the truth, what else can there be, save error?…” [Yoonus 10:32] “And say: ‘Truth has come and falsehood has vanished. Surely, falsehood is ever bound to vanish.’”[al-Isra’ 17:81]\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to our shaykh, Shaykh Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak, who answered as follows: Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Let there arise out of you a group inviting to all that is good, enjoining al-Maruf (Islamic monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbidding al-munkar (polytheism and all that Islam has forbidden) [Aal Imraan 3:104]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever of you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand [by taking action against it], and if he cannot, then with his tongue [by speaking out against it], and if he cannot, then with his heart [by feeling that it is wrong], and this is the weakest of faith. (Reported by Muslim, no. 70). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can [al-Taghaabun 64:16]. With regard to the evil thing that you mention in the question, you should try to change it or get rid of it as much as you can, so that you eliminate it or at least reduce it. This can be done by taking the matter to the people in authority who have the power to eliminate it or move it to another area, or by talking to the owner of the site and asking him to stop investing in evil which will only cause harm to him in this world and the next, and to invest in something that will be of benefit to him and the people living in the neighbourhood, without causing them any harm in either their spiritual or worldly affairs. As for taking action by destroying the nightclub, as mentioned in the question, this is not permitted, even if the one who does this is sure he will not get caught. The evil resulting from such an action is too great, such as the destruction of property which is it not permissible to destroy, and the accusation and torture of innocent people that is bound to happen during the investigation of the incident. Moreover, the owners of the nightclub may not give up, and are most likely to try again to build the place. Beware, my zealous brother, of being too hasty to change evil things without thinking about the consequences. It is a good job that you asked this question so that matters might become clear to you, which they surely are now. And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows: In the Name of Allaah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful. Praise be to Allaah, the Lord of the Worlds. This is not part of the Sunan al-Fitrah, but if there are too many hairs then they should be removed, so that they do not get contaminated with any impurity when using the toilet. There are reports in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which indicate that the pubic hairs should be removed, as it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The fitrah consists of five things, one of which is removing the pubic hairs. (Reported by al-Bukhaari). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also set a time limit of forty days, and the hair should not be left any longer than that,because of the hadeeth of Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: He set us a time limit of no more than forty days for trimming the moustache, clipping the nails, plucking the armpit hairs and shaving the pubic hair. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/284 and Muslim, 1/222). The fuqaha discussed the proper etiquette of removing the pubic hair and said that it is mustahabb to start shaving the pubic hair from beneath the navel, and to start on the right hand side, and one should also be concealed from the sight of others when doing this. One should also bury and hair or nail clippings removed. The reasons behind removing this dirty hair could also be applied to the hair on the testicles and around the anus, if impurity (najaasah) gets attached to it, because the purpose it to be comepletly clean and pure and keep away from anything that may cause dirt and impurities to cling to the body. In this case, removing this hair is a good thing. With the regard to women, the rulings on removing the pubic hair are the same as the rulings for men. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Imaam Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Saheeh: Chapter: Condemnation of the one who dies without having gone out for jihaad or having thought of doing so. Then he quoted the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever dies without having gone out for jihaad or having thought of doing so, dies on a branch of hypocrisy. (Saheeh Muslim, 3533). Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: What is meant is that the one who does this is behaving, in this regard, like the hypocrites who stay behind and do not go out for jihaad, because not engaging in jihaad is one of the branches of hypocrisy. This hadeeth also indicates that the one who intended to do an act of worship but died before he could do it is not to be condemned to the same extent as one who died without any such intention. Al-Sindi said, in his footnotes to Sunan al-Nisaa'i: without having thought of [it] means without having said to himself, I wish I could go out for jihaad. Or it could mean that he did not intend to go out for jihaad, and the sign of intending to go out for jihaad is preparing equipment. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And if they had intended to march out, certainly they would have made some preparation for it [al-Tawbah 9:64]. A person can prepare himself for jihaad in many ways, such as: Learning the virtues of jihaad and the rulings concerning it; preparing oneself with different kinds of acts of worship; training oneself to make sacrifices; forcing oneself to prefer others to oneself; spending for the sake of Allaah; studying and reading the biographies of mujaahideen and heroes of Islam; studying Islamic battles; constantly telling oneself that if jihaad is established and one has the means and is able to go for jihaad, there is no choice but to enlist; knowing how sinful it is to run away from the battlefield or flee before the kuffaar; studying the Seerah (biography) of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) during both the Makkan and Madani periods, and studying his battles and campaigns, to see how he conducted the jihaad in the context of his own circumstances, what he started with and how he prepared himself; understanding that jihaad has to go through stages, beginning with the nearest enemy, until one reaches the stage of being able to fight all the mushrikeen; being aware of the movements of hypocrisy; waging jihaad on four fronts against ones own nafs or base self, against the Shaytaan, against the kuffaar and against the hypocrites; understanding the importance of waging jihaad with ones wealth as well as with ones self. Know, my brother, that it is not difficult to combine jihaad with dawah, because each of them has its own time and place. When the mujaahideen were waging their conquests, they used to call people to Allaah before the battle started. When they conquered a country, they would call its people to Islam and teach them the religion. When there was no battle or jihaad going on, the doors of dawah were still wide open, and they would make dawah to their wives, children, relatives, neighbours and all people, Muslim and non-Muslim, calling them with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and arguing with them in a way that is better.

      "Praise be to Allah.There is no blessing in this world like embracing Islam, and there is no misfortune, sin or tribulation in this world like staying in kufr (disbelief). The created being must enter the religion of the Creator, and not wish for any other religion except Islam. The Creator knows the situation of His creatures and understands their inabilities, weaknesses, forgetfulness and mistakes, and so He forgives us for mistakes that are made unintentionally. Allaah does not ask anyone to do anything that is beyond his abilities, as he says (interpretation of the meaning): Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope [al-Baqarah 2:286]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah will forgive my ummah for their mistakes, and for what they forget, and for what they are forced to do. (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2033; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 1731). What you have mentioned in your question that you may eat something haraam without realizing is not something for which you will be punished. As long as you are going to do your best to avoid what Allaah has prohibited which is what you have indicated in your question then there is no sin on you. Even if a person does commit a haraam deed, Islam still offers a way out from every sin, in the form of repentance, remorse, determination not to repeat the sin, and seeking forgiveness from Allaah. This guarantees that the sin will be erased. So go ahead with determination, and do not hesitate. Allaah will be with you and will not let you down so long as you are following the religion with which He is pleased. May Allaah help you and keep you on the Straight Path.

      "Praise be to Allah.There is no doubt that the story you have told us is very sad and moving, especially when we see someone suffering because the person who is closest to him is lacking in terms of religion. But ‘Allaah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs for us.’ [Aal- ‘Imraan 3:173 – interpretation of the meaning] ‘Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ [al-Baqarah 2:156 – interpretation of the meaning]. This brother should remember that honouring one’s parents is one of the most important duties that human beings have towards one another, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years – give thanks to Me and to your parents, - unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly…” [Luqmaan 31:14-15]. These mushrik parents were doing their utmost to make their son associate partners with Allaah, yet in spite of that Allaah commanded the son to maintain a relationship with them and behave kindly with them in this world. So you are also obliged to treat your mother well, advise her to give up her bad behaviour, explain to her how sinful her deeds are and what punishment awaits her if she does not stop. If she responds, then praise be to Allaah. If she does not, then keep away from her in a good way; do not mix with her in ways that will adversely affect your religion, but do not upset her either. Behave with her in the world kindly, and continue to advise her from time to time. Your keeping away from her will not be a sin, if you do it for the sake of Allaah and in opposition to something wrong. (See the response of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen in Fataawaa Islamiyyah, 4/196; al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah fi Fataawaa Islamiyyah (Standing Committee on Islamic Fatwas), 4/204; Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen in Fataawaa al-Mar’ah al-Muslimah, 2/957) In conclusion therefore, if your staying with her will benefit her by increasing her religious commitment and eemaan, her adherence to Islamic duties and her avoidance of haraam deeds – or at least reduce her involvement in such activities – because she feels that she is being watched, for example, or because this will keep bad people away from her, and this will not cause you any harm at the same time, then stay with her in the hope of earning reward for whatever efforts you make, and Allaah will reward you for your patience. If you have already tried your utmost, to no avail, and have found that you are not making progress in any of the ways referred to above, and staying with her will have an adverse effect on your own religious commitment or reputation, then there is no sin on you if you keep away from her, as stated above, so long as you continue to check on her from time to time, to pay attention to her needs and to advise her. We ask Allaah to bless you with patience and reward you for your efforts, for He is the best of supporters and helpers.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Salaat al-Awwaabeen is otherwise known as Salaat al-Duhaa, and may consist of 2, 4, 6 or 8 rakahs, prayed after the sun has risen and before the time for Zuhr approaches. It is better to delay it until the day is hotter, the evidence for which is as follows: From Zayd ibn Arqam who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went out to the people of Qubaa and found them praying. He said: Salaat al-Awwaabeen is when the young camels lift up their feet (because of the heat of the sand). (Reported by Muslim, 1238). According to a report narrated by Imaam Ahmad from Zayd ibn Arqam, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to or entered the mosque at Qubaa after the sun had risen, and found the people there praying. He said: Salaat al-Duhaa should be prayed when the young camels lift up their feet (because of the heat of the sand). According to a report narrated by Muslim from al-Qaasim al-Shaybaani, Zayd ibn Arqam saw some people praying Duhaa and said: Do they not know that praying at some other time than this is better? The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Salaat al-Awwaabeen is when the young camels lift up their feet (because of the heat of the sand). (Saheeh Muslim, 1237). Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The phrase Salaat al-Awwaabeen is when the young camels lift up their feet (because of the heat of the sand) refers to when the sand becomes unbearably hot from the suns heat, and burns the soles of the young camels feet, so they alternately raise and lower their feet in response to the heat of the sand. Al-Awwaab means one who is obedient, or one who turns to obedience. The hadeeth also refers to the best time to offer this prayer, although it is permissible to pray it any time after the sun has risen and before it reaches its zenith. (Sharh Muslim lil-Nawawi).

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse (zinaa). Verily it is a faahishah (a great sin) and an evil way.” [al-Israa’ 17:32] Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Allaah says, forbidding His slaves to commit zinaa, to approach it or to put themselves in situations that may lead to it or tempt them to it: ‘And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily it is a faahishah’ i.e., a great sin, and ‘an evil way’ i.e., a bad way of behaving.” Imaam Ahmad said: “Yazeed ibn Haaroon told us that Jareer told us that Saleem ibn ‘Aamir told us, from Abu Umaamah that a young man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, grant me permission to commit zinaa.’ The people turned to him and told him off, saying, ‘Ssh!’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Come closer,’ so he came closer. He told him, ‘Sit down,’ so he sat down. He asked him, ‘Would you like this for your mother?’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah. May Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you!’ He said: ‘No people would like it for their mothers.’ He asked him, ‘Would you like this for your daughter?’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah. May Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you!’ He said: ‘No people would like it for their daughters.’ He asked him, ‘Would you like this for your sister?’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah. May Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you!’ He said: ‘No people would like it for their sisters.’ He asked him, ‘Would you like this for your paternal aunt?’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah. May Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you!’ He said: ‘No people would like it for their paternal aunts.’ He asked him, ‘Would you like this for your maternal aunt?’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah. May Allaah cause me to be sacrificed for you!’ He said: ‘No people would like it for their maternal aunts.’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) put his hand on him and said: ‘O Allaah, forgive him his sin, purify his heart and make him chaste.’ After that, the young man never paid attention to anything of that nature.” Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who invoke not any other god along with Allaah, not kill such life as Allaah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse – and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment shall be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; except those who repent and believe, and do righteous deeds, for those, Allaah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. And whosoever repents and does righteous good deeds, then verily, he repents towards Allaah with sincere repentance.” [al-Furqaan 25:68-71] It is not permitted for a man guilty of zinaa to marry a woman who is similarly guilty unless both of them repent sincerely to Allaah, may be He be glorified, so that they will no longer be described as being guilty of zinaa. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: not let any but a such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the Believers, such a thing is forbidden.” [al-Noor 24:3] So you must repent sincerely to Allaah, and follow this kabeerah (major sin) with many good deeds, so that Allaah may forgive you. If you are both sincere in your repentance and adhere to the laws of Allaah from now on, there is nothing wrong with your marrying her. Allaah forgives the one who repents.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they (the wives) shall wait (as regards their marriage) for four months and ten days, then when they have fulfilled their term, there is no sin on you if they (the wives) dispose of themselves in a just and honourable manner (i.e., they can marry). And Allaah is Well-Acquainted with what you do. [al-Baqarah 2:234] And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a years maintenance and residence without turning them out, but if they (wives) leave, there is no sin on you for that which they do of themselves, provided it is honourable (e.g., lawful marriage). And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. [al-Baqarah 2:240] Umm Atiyah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No woman should mourn for a dead person for more than three days, except for a husband, (in which case the period of mourning is) four months and ten days. She should not wear any coloured clothes, only simple dress. She should not apply kohl to her eyes, or use perfume, except for a little qust or izfaar (types of perfume), when she cleans herself after finishing her period. (Reported by Muslim, 2739). Umm Habeebah bint Abi Sufyaan reported that when the news of her fathers death reached her, she called for some perfume and wiped it on her forearms, and said: I do not need it, but I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: It is not permitted for a woman who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to mourn for any dead person for more than three days, except for a husband, (in which case the period of mourning is) four months and ten days. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4926). Umm Salamah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The woman whose husband has (recently) died should not wear clothes dyed with safflower or torn clothes, or dye her hair, or use kohl. (Reported by al-Nisaai, 3479, and others). Zaynab bint Kab ibn Ujrah reported that al-Furayah bint Maalik ibn Sinaan, the sister of Abu Saeed al-Khudri, told her that she came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him whether she should go back to her people among Banu Khudrah. Her husband had gone out in pursuit of some rebellious slaves of his, and when he caught up with them at the edge of al-Qadoom, they killed him. She said: I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) whether I should go back to my family, because my husband had not left me a place to live that belonged to him, or any money for provisions. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said yes, so I started to leave, and I had reached the hujurah (room) or the mosque, when the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called me or told someone to call me. So I came back, and he asked me, What did you say? I repeated the story I had told him about my husband. He said: Stay in your house for the specified length of time. So I spent my iddah there, four months and ten days. At the time of Uthmaan, he sent word to me asking about this, so I told him, and he followed what I said and judged in accordance with it. Muhammad ibn Bashshaar told us that Yahyaa ibn Saeed informed us that Sad ibn Ishaaq ibn Kab ibn Ujrah informed us of something similar. Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. The majority of scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and others followed this hadeeth and did not allow a widow to move out of her husbands home until her iddah was over. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 1125). On the basis of the texts quoted above, the scholars have defined the rules governing widows and described how the widows mourning should affect her life. These rules may be summed up as follows: It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to use perfume, whether on her body or on her clothes It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to adorn herself with things like henna or facial make-up, or to use kohl unnecessarily, or to use anything else that may make her beautiful and attractive to others. It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to wear attractive clothes, such as clothes dyed with safflower or saffron, or other types of red dyes and colours that are used for adornment. It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to wear jewellery. It is forbidden for the recently-widowed woman to spend the night outside her own home, meaning the home of her deceased husband, except for some Islamically legitimate reason, such as her being afraid for her own safety, or being evicted by the landlord of rented premises, etc. If a recently-widowed woman needs to go out for medical treatment, to attend legal proceedings in court, to take exams in school, or to go shopping when she has no-one who can do this for her, then she should do these things during the day, so long as she comes back home to her husbands house before maghrib (sunset). She is forbidden to marry or draw up a marriage contract; even engagement is forbidden, unless it is merely hinted at and not stated clearly. From the above, it is clear that Islam gives the husband immense rights. The wife should give up wearing adornments and perfume, and should stay in her husbands home during this period because of those rights. These rules also pay attention to her psychological state at this time when she has lost her support. Even though these rules are so clear, many people have still fallen prey to many different kinds of bidah when it comes to mourning, so they forbid a woman to do things that are not forbidden in Islam, and they fabricate lies and introduce bidah into the religion of Allaah. Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz said: Some people may think and imagine that a recently widowed woman should not speak to anyone, or speak to anyone on the telephone, or have a bath more than once a week, or walk barefoot in her house, or go outside in the moonlight, or other such nonsense which has no basis. But in fact she is allowed to walk barefoot or with shoes in her house, to do whatever she needs to in her house, to cook food for herself and her guests, to walk in the moonlight on the roof or in the garden of her house, to take a bath whenever she wants, to speak to whomever she wants so long as it is decent talk, to shake hands with other women and with her mahram relatives (close relatives such as father, brother, etc.) but not with non-mahrams, and to remove her headcovering so long as there are no non-mahrams present. She should not use henna, saffron or perfume, and she is not allowed to get engaged a hint is permissible but not a clear statement. And Allaah is the source of strength. (Fataawaa Islamiyah, 3/316) Shaykh Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen said: Wearing black to mourn the deceased is a form of bidah, and the wives of the deceased only need to avoid fancy clothes, adornment, jewellery, makeup and perfume during the mourning period. Neglecting regular work during the mourning period is also a form of bidah. The recently widowed woman should still take care of cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, laundry, etc., and there is no sin invloved in doing so. And Allaah knows best. (al-Lulu al-Makeen, 39). Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen said: Wearing special clothes to accept condolences is a form of bidah, in our opinion, because it could indicate that one is discontent with the decree of Allaah, may He be glorified. (Fataawaa al-Taziyah, 38). He also said: Wearing black as a sign of mourning is a false symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement a person should do what is taught by Islam, which is to say: Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raajioon. Allaahummajurni fi museebati wakhluf li khayran minhaa (To Allaah we belong and unto Him is our return. O Allah, recompense me for my affliction and replace it for me with something better). As regards wearing some special clothing, such as wearing black and so on, this has no basis, and it is false and reprehensible conduct. (Fataawa Islamiyah, 3/313). And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The sincere believer knows that one of the things that Allaah does is to test His slaves by means of various kinds of trials in order to demonstrate their patience and virtue, and to raise their status, to increase their reward for their steadfastness, and to test their sincerity in following the truth. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And surely, We shall try you till We test those who strive hard (for the Cause of Allaah) and the patient ones, and We shall test your facts (i.e., the one who is a liar, and the one who is truthful). [Muhammad 47:31]. Among the different types of test are the various means which the mushrikeen may employ to try to make a believer give up his faith, so they may apply psychological pressure to annoy him and make him go back to kufr. Allaah, may He be glorified, has mentioned this in His Book and has pointed out how we should respond. He tells us (interpretation of the meaning): You shall certainly be tried and tested in your wealth and properties and in your personal selves, and you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you (Jews and Christians) and from those who ascribe partners to Allaah, but if you persevere patiently, and become al-muttaqoon (pious), then verily, that will be a determining factor in all affairs, and that is from the great matters, [which you must hold on to with all your efforts] [Aal Imraan 3:186]. If what is being said or done by others is causing too much psychological pain, then how much worse must it be when it is done by the closest of people, one with whom you share ties of flesh and blood, the mother who gave birth to you? The hurt caused by those who are related to you is more bitter and painful/ to the soul than the blow of a sword. [poetry] But when the believer is exposed to the most painful attacks from the closest of people to him, he does not give in or retreat; he follows the Quraan in his dealings with the mother who is hurting him or cutting him off and turning away from him. This is illustrated in the following story: Musab ibn Sad ibn Abi Waqqaas reported from his father the mother of Sad swore that she would not speak to him, or eat or drink, until he renounced his religion (Islam) and became a kaafir. She said, You claim that Allaah tells you to honour and respect your parents. I am your mother and I am telling you to do this. She stayed like that for three days, until she fell unconscious from exhaustion. One of her sons, whose name was Umaarah, got up and gave her water to drink, and she began to pray against Sad. Then Allaah revealed the following aayah of the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me other of which you have no knowledge, the obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly [Luqmaan 31:14, 15]. (Reported by Muslim, 4432). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also suffered rejection at the hands of some of those who were most closely related to him, such as his paternal uncle Abu Lahab, but this did not stop him from spreading the message and conveying the religion, despite the harshness of the opposition. Rabeeah ibn Abbaad al-Dayli, who later became Muslim, said: I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with my own eyes in the marketplace of Dhool-Majaaz, saying, O people, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah and you will prosper. He was going through the alleyways of the market, and the people were gathering around him. I did not see anyone saying anything, and he did not stop saying, O people, say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah and you will prosper. Behind him there was a man with a squint and a handsome face, and his hair in two braids, saying, He is a Sabian and a liar. I asked, Who is this? They said, Muhammad ibn Abd-Allaah, who is saying that he is a Prophet. I asked, Who is this who is denouncing him? They said, His paternal uncle Abu Lahab. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 15448). So, my sister, you should hold fast to your religion and honour and respect your mother as Allaah commands. If she turns away from you and rejects your kind treatment, there will be no sin on you, even if this hurts you, because you are following the true guidance. Bear this with patient perseverance, for you are on the right path of truth. And Allaah is the Source of strength.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Washing the hair when doing ghusl (full ablution) after having intercourse is obligatory. The evidence (daleel) for that is the hadeeth narrated by Aaishah who said: When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did ghusl after having intercourse, he would start by washing his hands, then he would pour water with his right hand onto his left hand and wash his private parts, then he would do wudoo as for prayer, then he would take the water and put his fingers in his hair till he reached the roots, and when he saw that the water had reached the roots, he would pour water over his head three times. Then he poured water over the rest of his body, then he washed his feet. (Reported by Muslim, 474). Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen said in his commentary on Buloogh al-Maraam (p. 399): This also indicates that it is obligatory to make the water reach the roots of the hair when doing ghusl after intercourse, and if the hair is thick, one does this by putting one's fingers in one's hair and pouring water over one's head three times after the water has reached the roots of the hair. This ruling does not differentiate between men and women, but the scholars did discuss undoing the hair if it is braided, in the case of women who do ghusl after intercourse and after finishing their period. The most correct view is that it is not obligatory to undo braided hair. The evidence for this is the hadeeth of Um Salamah, who said: I said, O Messenger of Allaah, I am a woman who braids her hair, should I undo it to do ghusl after having intercourse? (According to another report, she said: and after my period?) He said, No. It is enough for you to pour water on your head three times. (Reported by Muslim). Further evidence is to be seen in the hadeeth of Ubayd ibn Umayr, who said: Aaishah heard that Abd-Allaah ibn Umar was commanding women to undo their braids when they did ghusl. She said, This is very strange on the part of Ibn Umar! He is telling women to undo their braids when they do ghusl why doesnt he tell them to shave their heads?! The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and I used to do ghusl using one vessel, and I never did more than pour water on my head three times. (Reported by Muslim, 331). Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen said in his commentary on Buloogh al-Maraam (p. 406): This hadeeth speaks about women doing ghusl: do they have to undo these braids and wash what is underneath them or not? The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained that it is not obligatory to undo them every time, because this is too difficult, especially in the case of ghusl after intercourse. There is a difference of scholarly opinion on the matter. Some scholars said that it is obligatory for women to undo their braids when doing ghusl after their periods, but not when doing ghusl after having intercourse. The difference between the two is obviously that ghusl after intercourse is done frequently, and it would be too difficult for a woman to undo her braids in the morning and put them back in the evening or vice versa, but ghusl following ones period is usually done only once a month, so it is easy for a woman to undo her braids for this purpose. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.A man is permitted to marry the wife of his maternal uncle, if they divorce and after she has completed her iddah (waiting-period after divorce). An uncles wife is not a mahram (close relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden), so there is nothing wrong with marrying her. But it is forbidden for a man to have any kind of haraam relationship with his uncles wife. Shaytaan could make something that is bad appear attractive to them, so it is essential to exercise caution. Also, it is not permitted to make her hate her husband so that she will get divorced and one can then marry her. One should try to reconcile and reunite, not destroy and break up. In principle, it is better for the children to stay with their father and mother in one family unit, unless the interests of shareeah in this case dictate otherwise. If the worst comes to the worst, and they get divorced, and there is no suspicion about your role in all this, then there is nothing wrong with marrying the woman who has been divorced by your uncle. Your treatment of your uncles children (your cousins), if they should come under your care, should be fair and proper, based on the ties of kinship between you. If you treat them well, doing so sincerely for the sake of Allaah, then you will have a great reward from Him. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Among the most important means of warding off the danger of sihr before it happens is seeking protection through the adhkaar (dhikr) prescribed in Islam, making du’aa’ and reciting prayers seeking refuge that were narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). These include: 1 – Reciting Aayat al-Kursiy [al-Baqarah 2:255] after every prescribed prayer, after reciting the adhkaar which are prescribed after the salaam. 2 – Reciting Aayat al-Kursiy when going to sleep. This is the greatest aayah in the Qur’aan, in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah! Laa ilaaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), Al-Hayyul-Qayyum (the Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists). Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills. His Kursiy extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great” [al-Baqarah 2:255] 3 – Reciting “Qul huwa Allaahu ahad”, “Qul a’oodhu bi Rabb il-Falaq” and “Qul a’oodhu bi Rabb il-Naas” [i.e., the last three soorahs of the Qur’aan] following every prescribed prayer, and reciting these three soorahs (three times) at the beginning of the day after Fajr prayer, and at the beginning of the night after Maghrib prayer. 4 – Reciting the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah at the beginning of the night. These are the aayahs in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The Messenger (Muhammad) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) ‘We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers’ — and they say, ‘We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).’ Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. ‘Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Mawlaa (Patron, Supporter and Protector) and give us victory over the disbelieving people” [al-Baqarah 2:285-285] And it was narrated in a saheeh report that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites Aayat al-Kursiy at night will have ongoing protection from Allaah and no devil will come near him until morning comes.” And it was also narrated in a saheeh report that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah at night, that will suffice him.” The meaning – and Allaah knows best – is that that will be sufficient protection for him against all evil. 5 – Seeking refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of that which He has created, night and day and when stopping to rest anywhere, be it in the city, in the desert, in the air or on the sea. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever stops to rest and says, ‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allaah il-taammah min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allaah from the evil of that which He has created),’ nothing will harm him until he moves on from that place.” 6 – The Muslim should say at the beginning of the day and the beginning of the night (three times): “Bismillaah alladhi laa yadurr ma’a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ardi wa laa fi’l-samaa’i wa huwa al-samee’ al-‘aleem (In the name of Allaah with Whose name nothing on earth or in heaven can cause harm, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing).” According to saheeh reports, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged us to recite this, and this is a means of keeping safe from all evil. These adhkaar and prayers for refuge are among the greatest means of warding off the evil of sihr (witchcraft) and other evils, for the one who recites them regularly with sincerity and faith, putting his trust in Allaah and depending upon Him, and being content with that. They are also some of the most effective weapons for warding off sihr after it has happened, along with humbly beseeching Allaah constantly and asking Him to remove the harm and relieve the distress. Among the du’aa’s which have been narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to treat diseases such as sihr and other things is the ruqyah by means of which he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to treat his companions: “Allaahumma Rabb al-naas, adhhib il-ba’s, washfi anta al-Shaafi laa shifaa’a illa shifaa’uka shifaa’an laa yughaadir saqaman (O Allaah, Lord of mankind, remove the harm and heal him, for You are the Healer and there is no healing except Your healing, with a healing which does not leave any disease behind).” There is also the ruqyah by means of which Jibreel treated the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Bismillaah urqeeka min kulli shay’in yu’dheeka, wa min sharri kulli nafsin aw ‘aynin haasid Allaah yashfeek, bismillaah urqeek (In the name of Allaah I perform ruqyah for you, from every thing that is harming you, from the evil of every soul or envious eye may Allaah heal you, in the name of Allaah I perform ruqyah for you).” This should be repeated three times. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. This is a saheeh hadeeth which was narrated by the two Shaykhs [al-Bukhaari and Muslim] in al-Saheehayn from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Treat women kindly, for woman was created from a bent rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is the top part, so treat women kindly.” This is a command to husbands, fathers, brothers and others to treat women kindly and not to oppress them; to give them their rights and to guide them to do good. This is what is obligatory upon everyone, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Treat women kindly.” This is not altered by the fact that a woman may sometimes mistreat her husband or relatives with her words or actions, because she was created from a rib as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, and the most crooked part of it is the top. It is well known that the top of it is the part by which it is attached, so the rib will have some crookedness in it at that point, as is well known. The meaning is that she will inevitably have some crookedness or shortcomings in her character. Hence it was narrated in another hadeeth in al-Saheehayn: “I have not seen any lacking in rational ability and failing in religion but (at the same time) robbing the wisdom of the wise, besides you [women].” The point is that this is the ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and it is narrated in al-Saheehayn from the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him). What is meant by lacking in rational ability, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, is that the testimony of two women is equivalent to the testimony of one man. Failing in religion, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, means that women spend days and nights without praying, i.e., because of menstruation or post-childbirth bleeding. This is a shortcoming which Allaah has decreed for them, and there is no sin on them because of that. So women should accept this in the way that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) meant it, even if a woman is knowledgeable and pious, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not speak of his own whims and desires, rather that was a Revelation that was revealed to him, which he conveyed to the ummah, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “By the star when it goes down (or vanishes). Your companion (Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only a Revelation revealed” [al-Najm 53:1-4]\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. They should come to some agreement concerning this issue – the sharing of household expenses between a husband and wife who both go out to work and earn a living – and avoid any dispute concerning it. With regard to how that should be done, this depends on a number of things, as discussed below: 1 – If your husband stipulated in the marriage contract that expenses are to be shared otherwise he will not let you work, then the Muslims are bound by their conditions, as the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Muslims are bound by their conditions, except for conditions which forbid something that is permitted or permit something that is forbidden.” And he SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The conditions which are most deserving of fulfilment are those by means of which sexual intimacy becomes permissible for you.” So you are bound by the conditions you made, if you made any conditions [in your marriage contract]. 2 – If you did not make any conditions, then the household expenses are all the responsibility of the husband, and the wife does not have to pay any of the household expenses; he is the one who has to pay them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Let the rich man spend according to his means” [al-Talaaq 65:7] And the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “You are obliged to spend on them and clothe them according to what is reasonable.” So spending is the obligation of the husband. He is the one who should take care of the household needs and his own needs and those of his wife and children. (The wife’s) money and salary belong to her, because that is given in return for her work and her efforts. (The husband) draw up the marriage contract on that basis, and he did not stipulate any condition that she should pay the household expenses, or half of them, etc. – unless she gives up any part of her salary of her own good pleasure, “but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful)” [al-Nisaa’ 4:4] But if the marriage contract was drawn up on the basis of any such condition, then the Muslims are bound by their conditions. But we advise you to give up part of your salary to your husband in order to please him and to resolve the dispute and solve the problem, so that you may live in peace and harmony. So agree upon something between yourselves, such as one half of the salary, or one-third, or one-quarter, etc., so that the problem will be solved and so that love and harmony may take the place of conflict. Or perhaps he will agree and be content with what Allaah has decreed for him, and he will spend according to his means, and he will forego all of your salary and have some pride concerning the matter. But if that is not possible, then there is no reason why you should not refer the matter to the courts in the city where you live, and whatever the shar’i court decides will be sufficient, in sha Allah. May Allaah help you both.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The issue of whether one can add the condition of saying “in sha Allaah” when speaking about matters of faith is one concerning which there has been lengthy and detailed debate among the scholars. The correct attitude in this case is to ask what is meant by the word “mu’min” (believer). If the speaker is referring to the essence of faith, i.e., Islam, without which one would be a kaafir, then in this case it is not correct to say “in sha Allaah.” This would imply some doubt about Islam, which is not permitted; the Muslim should be definite in his faith, and should say “I am a mu’min,” without adding “in sha Allaah.” However, if what is meant is the perfection of faith and the high rank which is above the level of just being a Muslim, then one should say “in sha Allaah,” because otherwise one would be praising oneself, which is forbidden as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Therefore ascribe not purity to yourselves” [al-Najm 53:32] If a person wants to say something straightforward to express his belief, then he should say “I am a Muslim.” In this case there is no need to add “in sha Allaah.” And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We appreciate your question concerning the ideas that you have about Islam, and we hope to discuss what you have written and correct some of your ideas, so as to arrive at a firm conviction of the truth of the matter. What you have mentioned about the Islamic belief about Paradise, and the enjoyment of wine, women and song therein, falls wide of the mark. The pleasures of Paradise are not merely physical in nature, they also include the joy of feeling safe and secure, and of being content with God and being close to Him. The greatest joy of all in Paradise will be seeing God, may He be glorified and exalted. When the people of Paradise see the Holy Face of God, they will forget all other kinds of pleasures that they have enjoying. There is in Paradise everything that will delight the heart and eye; no dirty or evil talk is heard there, nor sinful speech. No person know what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do. [al-Sajdah 32:17 interpretation of the meaning]. What I am trying to say is that the delights of Paradise are not limited to the kind you refer to in your question. They are far greater than that. You mention the idea that entrance to Paradise will only be granted to those who heed certain prohibitions, which things they will enjoy in Paradise in the Hereafter as a reward for avoiding it in this life. This generalization is not correct at all. Islam is a religion which commands action, not just abstinence. Salvation can only be attained through fulfilling commands, not just by avoiding things that are forbidden. Moreover, not every luxury in Paradise will consist of something that was forbidden in this world and is now being given as a reward. Some of the delights of Paradise will be things that were allowed in this world, such as marriage, good fruits like pomegranate and figs, etc., drinks like milk and honey, and so on. All of these are permitted in this world, and will be delights to be enjoyed in Paradise. The bad qualities of things that are forbidden in this world will not be present in their heavenly forms. For example, the wine of Paradise, as Allaah tells us, causes neither ghoul (any kind of hurt, abdominal pain, headache, sin, etc.) nor intoxication (see al-Saffaat 37:47). It does not rob a person of his mental faculties, or cause headaches and stomachaches. It is quite different from its earthly counterpart. The point I am making is that the delights of Paradise do not consist only of allowing things that were forbidden in this world. It is also worth pointing out that there are cases where abstention from prohibited things will not be rewarded by being given their equivalent in the Hereafter, whether those prohibited things are food, drinks, deeds or words. Poison, for example, will not be given as a luxury in Paradise, although it is forbidden in this world. The same applies to sodomy, incest and other things which will not be allowed in the Hereafter although they are forbidden in this world. This matter is quite clear, praise be to Allaah. The idea of being guaranteed Paradise, and that a persons life will be as horrible and unbearable as you describe if he has no such guarantee, is a misconception which itself leads to the results you mention. If you were to say that every person has a guarantee of Paradise, this would be utterly disastrous, because then everyone would commit all kinds of forbidden acts, feeling safe because of this guarantee. Many of the crimes committed by Jews and Christians have been done on the basis of this guarantee, with documents of forgiveness from their priests. Allaah has told us about such people (interpretation of the meaning): And they say, None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. Say, Produce your proof if you are truthful. [al-Baqarah 2:111] For us Muslims, Paradise is not the matter of our own desires or the desires of anyone else, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians); whoever works evil will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides Allaah. [al-Nisa 4:123] There follows a brief summary of the Islamic view regarding a guarantee of ones destiny. Islam offers a guarantee to every sincere Muslim who obeys Allaah and remains in this state of devotion until he dies, that he will definitely enter Paradise. Allaah says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meanings): But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to the Gardens under which rivers flow (i.e., in Paradise), to dwell therein forever. Allaahs promise is the truth, and whose words can be truer than those of Allaah? (Of course, none). [al-Nisa 4:122] Allaah has promised those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great reward (i.e., Paradise). [al-Maaidah 5:9] (They will enter) Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens), which the Most Beneficent (Allaah) has promised to His servants in the unseen: verily, His promise must come to pass. [Maryam 19:61] Say: Is that (torment) better, or the Paradise of Eternity promised to the muttaqeen (pious and righteous persons)? It will be theirs as a reward and final destination. [al-Furqaan 25:15] But those who fear Allaah and keep their duty to their Lord (Allaah), for them are built lofty rooms, one above another, under which rivers flow (i.e., Paradise). (This is) the Promise of Allaah, and Allaah does not fail in (His) promise. [al-Zumar 39:20] Islam also guarantees the disbeliever who ignores the commands of Allaah that he will definitely enter Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): Allaah has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the disbelievers, the Fire of Hell, therein shall they abide. It will suffice them. Allaah has cursed them and for them is the lasting torment. [al-Tawbah 9:68] But those who disbelieve, for them will be the Fire of Hell. Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die, nor shall its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever! [Faatir 35:36] Allaah will say to the disbelievers on the Day of Judgement (interpretation of the meaning): This is Hell which you were promised! Burn therein this Day, for that you used to disbelieve! [Yaa-Seen 36:63-64] Allaah will not go back on His promise to either the believers or the disbelievers. He describes how both of them will be at the end of the Day of Judgement (interpretation of the meaning): And the dwellers of Paradise will call out to the dwellers of the Fire (saying): We have indeed found true what our Lord had promised us; have you also found true, what your Lord promised (warnings, etc.)? They shall say, Yes. Then a crier will proclaim between them: The Curse of Allaah is on the zaalimeen (polytheists and wrongdoers, etc.). [al-Araaf 7:44] Everyone who believes and does righteous deeds, and dies in this state, will definitely enter Paradise. Everyone who disbelieves and does evil deeds, and dies in this state, will definitely enter Hell. One of the great guiding principles of Islam is that the believer should tread a path between fear and hope. He should not take it for granted that he will enter Paradise, because this will make him complacent, and he does not know in what state he will die. Nor should he assume that he is going to Hell, because this is despairing of the mercy of Allaah, which is forbidden. So the believer does righteous deeds, and hopes that Allaah will reward him for them, and he avoids evil deeds out of fear of the punishment of Allaah. If he commits a sin, he repents in order to gain forgiveness and protect himself from the punishment of Hell. Allaah forgives all sins and accepts the repentance of those who repent. If a believer fears that the good deeds he has sent on before him are not enough, as you suggest, then he will increase his efforts, in fear and hope. No matter how many righteous deeds he has sent on before him, he cannot rely on them and take them for granted, or else he will be doomed. He keeps striving and hoping for reward, and at the same time he fears lest his deeds be contaminated with any element of showing off, self-admiration, or anything that will lead to them being rejected by Allaah. Allaah describes the believers (interpretation of the meaning): those who give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their hearts full of fear (whether their alms and charity, etc.) have been accepted or not), because they are sure to return to their Lord (for reckoning). [al-Muminoon 23:60] So the believer keeps on striving, fearing and hoping, until he meets his Lord, believing in Tawheed (Divine Unity) and doing righteous deeds, and earns the pleasure of his Lord and Paradise. If you think about the matter, you will realize that these are the right motives for action, and that righteousness cannot be achieved in this life in any other way. As regards what you say about original sin, this matter needs to be approached from several angles. Firstly: The Islamic belief concerning human sin is: the individual bears the responsibility for his own sin; no one else should bear this burden for him, nor should he bear the burden for anyone else. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And no bearer of burdens shall bear anothers burden [Faatir 35:18]. This refutes the idea of original sin. If the father commits a sin, what fault is that of his children and grandchildren? Why should they bear the burden of a sin that someone else committed? The Christian belief that the descendents should bear the sin of their father is the essence of injustice. How can any sane person say that the sin should be carried down the centuries by all of humanity, or that the children, grandchildren and subsequent descendants should be tainted because of their fathers sin? Secondly, making mistakes is a part of human nature. Our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Every son of Aadam is bound to commit sins (reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2423), but Allaah has not left man unable to do anything about the mistakes that he makes. He gives man the opportunity to repent, and so the hadeeth (words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) quoted above concludes: and the best of those who commit sins are those who repent. The mercy of Allaah is clear in the teachings of Islam, as Allaah calls His servants (interpretation of the meaning): Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Zumar 39:53] This is human nature, and this is the solution to the problem of sin. But to make this human nature, which is bound to make mistakes, a barrier between the servant and his Lord which will prevent him from ever earning the pleasure of God, and to say that the only way to reach God is through His sending His (so-called) son down to earth to be humiliated and crucified while his father looks on, so that mankind could be forgiven, is an extremely odd idea. Just describing it sounds so unlikely that there is no longer any need to refute it in detail. Once, when discussing this issue with a Christian, I said, If you say that God sent down His son to be crucified to atone for the sins of the people alive at his time and afterwards, what about those who had come before and died as sinners before the time of Christ, and had no opportunity to know about him and believe in the Crucifixion so that their sins might be forgiven? All he could say was: No doubt our priests have an answer to that! Even if they do have an answer, it is bound to be concocted. There is no real answer. If you really examine the Christian teaching on human sin with an open mind, you will see that they say that God sacrificed His only son to atone for the sins of mankind, and that this son was a god. If it was true that he was a god who was beaten, insulted and crucified, and died, then this doctrine contains elements of blasphemy because it accuses God of weakness and helplessness. Is God really incapable of forgiving the sins of all His servants with just one word? If He is Able to do all things (and the Christians do not dispute this fact), then why would He need to sacrifice His son in order to achieve the same thing? (Glorified and exalted be He far above what the wrongdoers say about Him!) He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have children when He has no wife? He created all things and He is the All-Knower of everything. [al-Anaam 6:101 interpretation of the meaning] An ordinary man would not accept anyone harming his child; he would come to his defence, and would never hand him over to an enemy who would insult him, let alone leave him to face the worst kind of death. If this is the attitude of a mere created being, what then of the Creator? Thirdly, the Christian doctrine of original sin has a negative effect because, as you have mentioned, it does not require any duties of man other than to believe that God sent His son to this earth to be crucified and to die to atone for the sins of mankind. Thus a person becomes a Christian and is to earn the pleasure of God and be admitted to heaven. Moreover, the Christian believes that everything that happened to the son of God was only to atone for his sins, past present and future, so there is no need to wonder why Christian societies have seen such an increase in murder, rape, robbery, alcoholism and other problems. After all, did not Christ die to atone for their sins, and havent their sins been wiped out, so why should they stop doing these things? Tell me, by your Lord, why do you sometimes execute murderers, or put criminals in jail, or punish them in other ways, if you believe that the criminals sins have all be atoned for and forgiven through the blood of Christ? Is this not a strange contradiction? You ask why, if the Muslims are the chosen people of mankind, they do not spread their religion. The fact of the matter is that sincere Muslims have always sought to do just that. How else could Islam have spread from Makkah to Indonesia, Siberia, North Africa, Bosnia, South Africa and all parts of the world, East and West? The faults in the behaviour of some modern Muslims cannot be blamed on Islam; those faults are the result of going against Islamic teachings. It is not fair to blame the religion for the faults of some of its adherents who have gone against it or gone astray. Are Muslims not being more just than Christians when they affirm that the sinner is threatened with the punishment of Allaah unless he repents, and that for some sins there is a deterrent, a punishment to be carried out in this world as an expiation for the Hereafter, as in the case of the punishments for murder, theft, fornication/adultery, etc.? What you say about it be so easy to become a Christian, as compared to becoming a Muslim, is clearly mistaken. The key to Islam is no more than two simple phrases: Ash-hadu an laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wa anna Muhammadan Rasool-Allaah (I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah). With these few words, a person enters Islam in a matter of seconds. There is no need for baptism or priests, or even to go to a certain place such as a mosque or anywhere else. Compare this with the ridiculous procedures of baptism which the Christians do when they want to admit someone to the Church. Then there is the fact that the Christians venerate the cross on which Jesus was tortured and crucified in great pain as they claim. They take it as a sacred object of blessing and healing, instead of scorning it and hating it as a symbol of oppression and the worst possible way for the son of God to die! Do you not see that the Muslims are closer than others to the truth, because they believe in all the Prophets and Messengers, respecting them all and recognizing that all of them taught the truth of Divine Unity (Tawheed) and that each of them was appointed by Allaah and sent to his people with laws that were appropriate to the time and place? When the fair-minded Christian sees the followers of Islam believing in Musa (Moses), Eesaa (Jesus), and Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and in the original Torah and Gospel, as well as the Quraan, and sees his own people denying the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and rejecting the Quraan, wouldnt his open-mindedness make him think that the Muslims are most likely to be right? You say that the Messiah said, No one comes to the Father except through me. We need, first of all, to be sure that these words can truly be attributed to Jesus. Secondly, this is clearly not true. How then could mankind have known God at the times of Nooh (Noah), Hood, Saalih, Yoonus (Jonah), Shuayb (Jethro), Ibraaheem (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and other Prophets? If you were to say that during the time of Jesus (upon whom be peace) and up to the time of the Final Prophet, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the Children of Israel had no other way to know the religion of Allaah except through the way of Jesus, this would be correct. Finally, you quote the Messiah as saying, I and the Father are one. This is clearly not correct. If we examine the matter objectively, without letting our own desires get in the way, it becomes clear that the conjunction and in the phrase I and the Father implies that two separate entities are involved. I is one entity, and the Father is another. If you say, So-and-so and I, it is obvious to any rational person that they are two separate people. The equation 1+1+1=1 makes no sense to any rational person, whether he is a mathematician or not. Finally, I advise you (and I do not think that you will reject this advice) to think deeply about what you have read, putting aside your background, any pre-conceived ideas, your own desires and feelings of attachment to your religion or culture, and to seek guidance sincerely from Allaah. Allaah Most Generous and will never let any of His servants down. Allaah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path, and He is Sufficient for us and is the best disposer of affairs..\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.So long as there is an offensive odour coming from it, then praying in them (the parks) is not correct, because one of the conditions of prayer being correct is that the place where the Muslim prays should be taahir (pure and clean). If he spreads out a thick and taahir (pure) mat, then his prayer will be valid. But it is not permissible for Muslims to pray in parks – even on thick and pure mats – rather they have to pray with their Muslim brothers in the houses of Allaah – the mosques – of which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “In houses (mosques) which Allaah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honoured), in them His Name is remembered [i.e. Adhaan, Iqaamah, Salaah (prayers), invocations, recitation of the Qur’aan]. Therein glorify Him (Allaah) in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings, Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allâh (with heart and tongue) nor from performing As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah) nor from giving the Zakaah. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection). That Allaah may reward them according to the best of their deeds, and add even more for them out of His Grace. And Allaah provides without measure to whom He wills” [al-Noor 24:36-38] And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever hears the call (to prayer) and does not come, then his prayer does not count, unless he has a (valid) excuse.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-Daraaqutni, Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim. Its isnaad is (saheeh) according to the conditions of Muslim). A blind man asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “O Messenger of Allaah, I have no guide to bring me to the mosque. May I have a dispensation to pray in my house?” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “Can you hear the call to prayer?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then respond.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh). And there are many ahaadeeth which say the same thing. What the Committee for Enjoining what is Good and Forbidding what is Evil should do is to disallow people to pray in parks, and tell them to pray in the mosques, in accordance with the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety)”[al-Maa’idah 5:2] and “The believers, men and women, are Awliyaa’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘roof (i.e. Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden)” [al-Tawbah 9:71] And in accordance with the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “Whoever among you sees an evil action, let him change it with his hand (by taking actions); if he cannot then with his tongue (by speaking out against it); and if he cannot then with his heart (by feeling that it is evil) – and that is the weakest of faith.” (Narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh).\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The Hanafi, Hanbali and most of the Shaafa'i fuqahaa are agreed that it is OK for a Muslim to leave something to a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Islamic rule) in his will, and vice versa, so long as this is within the guidelines of shareeah. Their evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity. [al-Mumtahinah 60:8]. Also, being a kaafir does not disqualify a person from ownership, and as it is OK to sell to a kaafir or give him a gift, it is also OK to include him in ones will. Some of the Shaafais think that it is OK only if a specific person is named, such as saying I leave [such and such] to so and so; but if a person says I leave [it] to the Jews and Christians, this is not OK because it sounds as if he is making their kufr the reason for leaving something to them. The Maalikis agree with others that it is OK for a non-Muslim to leave something to a Muslim. With regard to a Muslim leaving something to a non-Muslim, Ibn al-Qaasim and Ashhab said that it is allowed if it is done for a reason, such as upholding family ties, otherwise it is makrooh, and should not be done at the expense of a Muslim. No one would do such a thing except one whose faith is diseased. (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 2/312) Unfortunately, nowadays we see some Muslims, especially those who are living in kaafir countries, leaving huge sums of money to Christian, Jewish or other kaafir organizations, on the basis that these are charitable, educational or humanitarian organizations and so on, but there is no way that Muslims can benefit from this. The only ones who benefit from it are the kuffar, and their hungry oppressed refugee Muslim brothers are left with no h elp or support. This is a sign of weak, diluted faith and of allegiance to and admiration of the kuffaar and their disbelieving societies. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.

      "Praise be to Allah.The person who is suffering from incontinence should make a new and separate wudoo for each prayer when the time comes, even if he has just made wudoo for another prayer a short time before. This is because the Prophet taught the woman who suffers from istihaadah (prolonged non-menstrual vaginal bleeding) to do this. Aaishah said: Faatimah bint Abi Hubaysh came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I am a woman who experiences istihaadah and I do not become clean from bleeding. Should I forget about salaah? He said: No, that is from a vein; it is not menses. When your period starts, then stop praying, and when it ends, wash the blood from your body and pray again. Abu Muaawiyah said in his hadeeth: He said: Do wudoo for each prayer, until the time for the next prayer comes Abu Eesaa said: The hadeeth of Aaishah is a saheeh hasan hadeeth, and this is the opinion of more than one scholar among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Taabieen. It is also the opinion of Sufyaan al-Thawri, Maalik, Ibn al-Mubaarak and al-Shaafii that when the woman who suffers from istihaadah finishes her regular period, she should do ghusl, then do wudoo for each prayer. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 116; the hadeeth was reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 221). Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The ruling on non-menstrual blood (istihaadah) is the same as the ruling on anything that breaks wudoo: she should do wudoo for each prayer, but she should not pray more than one fard prayer with that wudoo, whether she is praying on time or is making up the prayer later, because of the apparent meaning of the hadeeth, You should do wudoo for each prayer. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars. (Fath al-Baari, Kitaab al-hayd, Bab al-istihaadah). The same ruling applies to the person who suffers from continual incontinence or wind. You can pray as many naafil prayers as you like with the wudoo you made for a fard prayer, until the time for that fard prayer is over. And Allaah knows best.\n",

They were eager to earn the reward mentioned in the hadeeth: “Whoever stays up and prays at night in Ramadaan out of faith and in the hope of reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 36).

      "Praise be to Allah.Seeing Allaah in reality (as opposed to in a dream) is not possible in this life, although no doubt it will happen after death. This is not because seeing Him is impossible in itself, but because Allaah has willed that it should not happen. This is for many reasons, some of which have been found by the scholars, and others which remain known only to Allaah. Among the reasons which we do understand is human weakness, which is apparent from the story of Moosa (upon whom be peace), which we will quote shortly. Another reason is that seeing Allaah is a great blessing and joy, indeed it is the greatest blessing, so it is withheld for the place of ultimate blessing and joy, namely Paradise. Another reason is that this world is a mixture of good believers and kuffaar, so this blessing is deferred until it will be given exclusively to the believers in Paradise. Withholding this blessing until the Hereafter also provides a strong motive to do good in this world, so that one may see Allaah and feel secure and content in nearness to Him in the Hereafter. Evidence that it is not possible to see Allaah in this world Allaah says, in the story of Moosa (peace be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): And when Moosa came at the time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, O my Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You. Allaah said, You cannot see Me, but look upon the mountain, if its stands still in its place, then you shall see Me. So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it collapse to dust, and Moosa fell down unconscious. Then when he recovered his senses he said, Glory be to You, I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers. [al-Araaf 7:143]. The word lan (here translated as cannot in You cannot see Me) conveys the meaning of You will not see Me in this life, because there is evidence that man will see Allaah in the Hereafter, which means that this lan is not eternal in application. (The negative particle lan often carries a sense of eternal negation, that something will never happen, but this is not the case here. Translator). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): No vision can grasp Him, but His Grasp is over all vision. He is the Most Subtle and Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things. [al-Anaam 6:103]. The commentator al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his tafseer of this aayah: Concerning the phrase No vision can grasp Him, several comments regarding it have been narrated from the imaams of the salaf, one of which is that it means, you will not be able to see Him in this world, even though you will see Him in the Hereafter. The reports that state this, narrated from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), reach the level of mutawaatir and are reported through more than one sound isnaad in the books of Saheeh, Musnad and Sunan. [Translators note: a mutawaatir report is one that was narrated by so many to so many that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie]. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): It is not given to any human being that Allaah should speak to him unless (it be) by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or (that) He sends a Messenger to reveal what He will by His Leave. Verily, He is Most High, Most Wise. [al-Shoora 42:51]. Abu Hurayrah said: Some people said, O Messenger of Allaah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection? He said, Do you have any doubt about seeing the sun on a cloudless day? They said, No, O Messenger of Allaah. He said, Do you have any doubt about seeing the full moon on a cloudless night? They said, No, O Messenger of Allaah. He said, You will see Him just as clearly on the Day of Resurrection (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6088). It is clear that the idea that Allaah will not be seen in this life was well-entrenched in the minds of the Sahaabah. They were asking about the Hereafter, and this is what the Prophets answer also referred to. Abu Dharr said: I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Have you seen your Lord? He said, (There is) light, how could I see Him? This light, which prevented him from seeing Him, is a veil of light, which is further explained in the hadeeth of Abu Moosa, who said, The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up and told us five things: Allaah does not sleep, and it is not befitting that He should sleep. He lowers the scale and lifts it. The deeds in the night are taken up to Him before the deeds of the day, and the deeds of the day before the deeds of the night. His veil is the light. If He were to withdraw it (the veil), the splendour of His countenance would consume His creation as far as His sight reaches. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and Muslim, 263). Further clear evidence comes in the hadeeth which warns against the Dajjaal (antichrist): Written between his eyes is (the word) kaafir, which will be read by everyone who hates his works, or every believer will read it. Know that none of you will see your Lord until he dies. (Reported by Muslim, 5215). So any claim that anyone but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) can see Allaah in reality is impossible, according to the consensus of the scholars. However, there is some disagreement among the scholars as to whether or not the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw Allaah on the night of the Miraaj. The correct view is that he did not see Him physically, with his own two eyes, because when he was asked about this, he said, (There is) light, how could I see Him? According to another report, he said, I saw light. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not see Him, but he saw His veil of light. The question of whether Allaah may be seen in a dream does not contradict the fact that Allaah cannot be seen in reality in this world, because all the texts quoted above speak about physical vision when one is awake, not the vision of the heart when one is asleep. Proof that the latter kind of vision is possible is to be seen in the hadeeth about the dispute of the chiefs on high (the angels). Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, My Lord came to me tonight in the most beautiful form. I think he said, in a dream. He said, O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high disputed about? I said, No. He put His hand between my shoulder-blades and I could feel its coolness on my chest (or just beneath my throat), then I knew everything that is in the heavens and on earth. He said, O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high disputed about? I said, Yes. He said, About expiation, and expiation is staying in the mosque after prayers, walking to join congregational prayers, and doing wudoo properly in adverse conditions. Whoever does that will live a good life and die a good death, and will be as sinless as the day his mother bore him. He said, O Muhammad, when you pray, say Allaahumma innee asaluka fal al-khayraat wa tark al-munkaraat wa hubb al-masaakeen, wa idha aradta bi ibaadika fitnatan faqbudni ilayka ghayra maftoon (O Allaah, I ask you to make me do good deeds and avoid evil deeds, and to make me love the poor and wretched. If You want to test Your slaves, then take me unto You without subjecting me to the trial). Ones status in Paradise may be raised by spreading the greeting of salaam, feeding others, and praying at night when people are sleeping. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 16026; and by al-Tirmidhi, 3159, who said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth). Some of the scholars have commented that it is possible to see Allaah in a dream. Imaam al-Daarimi said, in his refutation of Bishr ibn Ghiyaath, This seeing took place in a dream, and in a dream it is possible to see Allaah in any shape or form. (p. 166) Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said, A believer may see his Lord in a dream, in various forms according to his faith and belief. If his eemaan is correct, he can only see Him in a beautiful form, and if his faith is lacking, this will be reflected in the way he sees Him. Seeing Allaah in a dream is not like seeing Him in reality. It may have different interpretations and meanings referring to something in reality. (al-Fataawa, 3/390) He also said, Whoever sees Allaah in a dream sees Him in a form that corresponds to his own state. If he is righteous, he will see Him in a beautiful form, which is why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him in the most beautiful form. (al-Fataawa, 5/251) Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz was asked about the ruling concerning one who claims to have seen the Lord of Glory in a dream, and whether it was true, as some claim, that Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal had seen the Lord of Glory in his dreams more than one hundred times. The Shaykh answered as follows: Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) and others said that it is possible for a man to see his Lord in a dream, but what he sees is not reality, because there is nothing like Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. [al-Shoora 42:11]. Nothing in His creation is like unto Him. A person may dream that his Lord is speaking to him, and no matter what kind of image he sees, that image is not Allaah, because there is nothing that is like Allaah in any way. Shaykh Taqiy al-Deen (may Allaah have mercy on him) mentioned that dreams differ according to the state of the person who is dreaming. The more righteous and closer to goodness a person is, the more correct his dream will be, but the truth is still something other than what he sees, because the guiding principle is still that there is nothing like unto Allaah. He may hear a voice and be told such-and-such, or to do such-and-such, without any clear image resembling anything in creation, because there is nothing at all like unto Allaah Some people may imagine that they have seen their Lord when in fact this is not the case. The Shaytaan may deceive a person and make him imagine that he is their Lord, as it was reported that he made Abd al-Qaadir al-Jeelaani see him on a throne above water, and said, I am your Lord and I freed you from doing any duties (worship, etc.). Abd al-Qaadir al-Jeelaani said, Get lost, O enemy of Allaah! You are not my Lord, because the commands of my Lord are not cancelled for anyone, or some similar words. As for whether Imaam Ahmad saw his Lord, I do not know if this is true or not. It is said that he saw his Lord but I do not know if this is true. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It was proven in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah likes the act of sneezing and dislikes the act of yawning, so if any one of you sneezes and praises Allaah (says “al-hamdu Lillaah”), it is a duty on every Muslim who hears him to say to him, “Yarhamuk Allaah (may Allaah have mercy on you).” As for yawning, it is from the Shaytaan, so if any of you feels the urge to yawn, he should suppress it as much as he can, for when any one of you yawns, the Shaytaan laughs at him.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/505) It was also reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If any one of you sneezes, let him say ‘Al-hamdu Lillaah,’ and let his brother or his companion say, ‘Yarhamuk Allaah.’ And if he says to him, ‘Yarhamuk Allaah,’ let him say, ‘Yahdeekum Allaahu wa yusliha baalakum (May Allaah guide you and correct your thinking).’” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/502) Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that two men sneezed in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said “Yarhamuk Allaah” to one of them, but not to the other. The one to whom he did not say it said: “So and so sneezed, and you said ‘Yarhamuk Allaah’ to him; I sneezed but you did not say it to me.” He said, “He praised Allaah (said ‘al-hamdu Lillaah’) and you did not.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/504) Abu Moosa al-Ash’ari reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When one of you sneezes and praises Allaah, then say ‘Yarhamuk Allaah’ to him, but if he does not praise Allaah then do not say it.” (Reported by Muslim 2992) Sneezing brings a person the blessing of relief by releasing vapours that were trapped in the head which, if they were to remain there, would cause him pain and sickness. For this reason, Islam tells him to praise Allaah for this blessing and for the fact that his body is still intact after this jolt that shook him like an earthquake… for sneezing causes a disturbing movement in the body… It was said (concerning the origin of the word “tashmeet” [which is translated here as “saying ‘yarhamuk Allaah’, but the original meaning is to tell someone to rejoice at another’s ‘misfortune’]): this is telling him to feel joyful because he has annoyed the Shaytaan by praising Allaah for the blessing of sneezing and its association with things that Allaah likes. When a person mentions Allaah and praises Him, this annoys the Shaytaan in several ways, for example: the act of sneezing itself, which Allaah likes; his praising Allaah for it; the Muslims praying for mercy for him; and his prayer for them to be guided. All of this annoys the Shaytaan and makes him upset, so the believer is told to rejoice over this annoyance of his enemy. Praying for mercy for the one who sneezes is called tashmeet because it implies that he should rejoice over the annoyance of his enemy. This is a good meaning which people should bear in mind when they sneeze or say ‘yarhamuk Allaah’ to one who sneezes, and they should appreciate the blessing of sneezing for the body and mind, and understand why Allaah likes it. Praise be to Allaah as is His due for He is the Most Generous and Majestic. The scholar Ibn Muflih al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported that Imaam Ibn Hubayrah said: “Al-Raazi reported from some doctors: sneezing is not a sign of the onset of sickness, unless it is accompanied by catarrh.” Ibn Hubayrah said: “If a person sneezes, this is an indication of good health, sound digestion and physical strength, so he should praise Allaah. This is why the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to praise Allaah.” It is also important to know that the Muslim should submit to the texts and act in accordance with them, without trying too hard to understand precisely why a text commands or forbids something. He should believe that Allaah is the Wise and Aware, Who does not prescribe anything for His slaves unless it is in their best interests, in this world and the next, even though it may not cross their minds and some people may understand part of the wisdom behind it whilst others will never know. The Muslim’s basic rule is to follow the commands, and if he has some knowledge of the reason behind the commands, then praise be to Allaah. And Allaah knows best. For further details on the rules concerning sneezing, see: Al-Aadaab al-Shara’iyyah by Ibn Muflih, 2/334; Zaad al-Ma’aad by Ibn al-Qayyim, 2/438; Ghadhaa’ al-Albaab by al-Safaareeni, 1/441\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The fuqahaa differed as to whether it is permissible to give charity to a kaafir. The reason for the difference of opinion is that charity means giving something in the hope of earning reward, so will a person be rewarded for spending on a kaafir? The Hanbalis said and it is the well known view of the Shaafais and was also reported from Muhammad in al-Siyar al-Kabeer that it is permissible to give charity to kaafirs in general. This is because of the general applicability of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And they give food, in spite of their love for it (or: for the love of Him) to the poor, the orphan and the captive [al-Insaan 76:8]. Ibn Qudaamah said: At that time, captives could only have been kaafirs. The Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: In (the kind treatment of) every living being there is a reward. Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: My mother came to visit me and she was a mushrik at the time of the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I asked the Messenger of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), My mother has come to visit me, and she does not want to become Muslim. Should I uphold the ties of kinship with my mother? He said, Yes, uphold the ties of kinship with your mother. Because upholding the ties of kinship is praiseworthy in all religions, and giving to others is a noble characteristic. Al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 26. If a non-Muslim person is asking, it is either of the following cases: He has an urgent need, such as food, and if he does not receive food he will die. In this case you should feed him, unless he is openly hostile towards Islam, in which case you should refrain. In cases like this, what is given to him should be charity (sadaqah), not zakaah. His need is not urgent as in the first case, but something may be given to a person like this for the purpose of opening his heart and calling him to Islam, because this serves the overall purpose of shareeah.

It should be based on whichever of the two works out better for the poor, because the prices of gold and silver vary from time to time and from country to country. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 9/257) and because this will be more beneficial to the poor. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 9/254) Given that currently the price of silver is lower than the price of gold, the nisab should be based on the price of silver, so if a person’s wealth (in paper money) reaches the nisab on that basis, he has to pay zakah. The nisab for silver is roughly equivalent to 595 grams of silver, so the one who has wealth has to pay 2.5% or 25 out of every 1,000 that he has in currency, after one year has passed).

If a marriage is announced in one city or location, it need not be announced in another, but we do not advise you to conceal the news of your marriage, especially since such news usually becomes known eventually.

We ask Allah to enable you to go for Hajj and do all its rites. What is Hajj? Hajj means travelling for the purpose of visiting the Ka`bah, the sacred House of Allah, to perform the rites (manasik), i.e., the actions and words reported in accounts of the Prophet’s (peace and blessings be upon him) Hajj . The rites include Tawaf or walking around the Ka`bah seven times, al-Sa’i or running between the hills of Safa and Marwah seven times, standing at ‘Arafah, stoning the Jamarat (stone pillars representing the Shaytan) at Mina, etc. Benefits of Hajj Hajj brings immense benefits to people , as they declare the Unity (Tawhid) of Allah, there is forgiveness for the pilgrims, Muslims get to know one another and learn the rules of their religion, and so on.

      "Praise be to Allah. Performing the rituals of Hajj has many virtues and there is a great deal of wisdom behind them. The one who is enabled to understand them and do them is blessed with a great deal of good. We will try to list as many as we can here. 1-Travelling for Hajj to perform the rituals; his journey reminds him his journey to Allaah and the Hereafter. When he travels he leaves behind his loved ones, family, children and homeland, and the journey to the Hereafter is like that too. 2-The one who goes on this journey takes with him supplies that will help him reach the holy land, and this reminds him that for the journey to his Lord, he must have with him provisions that will help him to arrive safely. Concerning this, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And take a provision (with you) for the journey, but the best provision is At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness)” [al-Baqarah 2:197]. 3-Just as travelling is a kind of torment, the journey to the Hereafter is like that too, and many times greater. Ahead of a person there is the agony of death, death itself, the grave, the gathering, the reckoning, the weighing in the Balance, and al-Siraat (a bridge across Hell, over which all must pass), then Paradise or Hell. The blessed one is the one whom Allaah saves. 4-When the pilgrim wears the ihraam garments (two pieces of unsewn white cloth), this reminds him of the shroud in which he will be wrapped. This motivates him to give up sin. Just as he sheds his clothes, he should also shed his sins; just as he puts on two clean white garments, his heart and limbs should also be clean and untainted with sin. 5-When he says at the meeqaat (the point at which pilgrims enter ihraam), “Labbayk Allaahumma labbaayk (Here I am at Your service, O Allaah)”, which means that he has responded to his Lord, may He be exalted, how can he remain in a state of sin without saying to his Lord, “Labbayk Allaahumma labbaayk (Here I am at Your service, O Allaah)”, meaning, I have responded to Your prohibition of them. This is the time to give up sin. 6-When he gives up the things that are forbidden when in ihraam, and keeps busy with the talbiyah and dhikr (remembering Allaah), this shows the state that the Muslim should always be in. This is a means of training and disciplining himself, because he is disciplining himself by giving up what is basically permitted, but Allaah has forbidden it to him in this situation. So how can he transgress the sacred limits that Allaah has set for all times and places? 7-When he enters the sacred House of Allaah, which Allaah has made a place of safety for mankind, this reminds him of safety on the Day of Resurrection, and that no one can attain it without effort and striving. The greatest source of safety on the Day of Resurrection is Tawheed (belief in the Oneness of Allaah) and avoiding shirk (associating others with Allaah). Concerning this Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “It is those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah and worship none but Him Alone) and confuse not their Belief with Zulm (wrong, i.e. by worshipping others besides Allaah), for them (only) there is security and they are the guided” [al-An’aam 6:82]. When he kisses the Black Stone, which is the first ritual that he does, this trains the visitor to venerate the Sunnah (the way of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), and not to transgress against the law of Allaah on the basis of his flawed reasoning. He knows that what Allaah has prescribed for mankind is wise and good, and he trains himself to submit fully to his Lord, may He be exalted. Concerning that, ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said, after kissing the Black Stone: “I know that you are just a stone and you can neither cause harm nor bring benefit. Were it not that I saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissing you, I would not have kissed you.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1520) and Muslim (1720). 8-When he circumambulates the Ka’bah, that reminds him of his father Ibraaheem (Abraham, peace be upon him), and how he built the Ka’bah as a place of safety for mankind and called them to come on pilgrimage to this House. Then came our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who also called people to come to this House. Moosa (Moses) and ‘Eesa (Jesus – peace be upon them both) also came on pilgrimage to this House, which is therefore a symbol of these Prophets. How could it be otherwise when Allaah commanded Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) to build it and venerate it? 9-When he drinks the water of Zamzam, this reminds him of the blessing that Allaah has bestowed upon people in this blessed water, from which millions of people have drunk for many centuries, and it still has not dried up. He is encouraged to say du’aa’ (supplication) when drinking it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for.” Narrated by Ibn Maajah (3062) and Ahmad (14435). It is a hasan hadeeth which was classed as such by Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) in Zaad al-Ma’aad (4/320). 10-The saa’i (running) between al-Safa and al-Marwa reminds him of the great hardship undergone by our mother Haajar (Hagar), and how she ran between al-Safa and al-Marwa looking for someone to save her from the trouble in which she found herself, and especially for water to give to her young son Ismaa’eel (Ishmael). This woman bore this test with patience, and turned to her Lord. In her we have a good example, because when a man remembers the striving and patience of this woman, his problems seem less significant, and when a woman remembers one of her own gender, her hardship becomes easier to bear. 11-Standing in ‘Arafah reminds the pilgrim of the great gathering of mankind on the Day of Gathering. If the pilgrim suffers exhaustion because of the crowding together of thousands of people, then how about when all of mankind are gathered, barefoot, naked and uncircumcised? 12-As we said with regard to kissing the Black Stone, so too when stoning the Jamaraat (stone pillars representing the Devil), the Muslim trains himself to be obedient and to follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Thus he manifests pure submission to Allaah. 13-When he offers the sacrifice, this reminds him of the important incident when our father Ibraaheem submitted to Allaah’s command to sacrifice his only son Ismaa’eel (Ishmael), and that there is no room for compassion which goes against the commands and prohibitions of Allaah. It also teaches him to respond to the command of Allaah, as Ismaa’eel said: “ ‘O my father! Do that which you are commanded, In sha’ Allaah (if Allaah wills), you shall find me of As‑Saabiroon (the patient)’” [al-Saffaat 37:102]. 14-When he exits ihraam and that which Allaah had forbidden to him during ihraam becomes permissible to him again, this trains him to be patient, and teaches him that with hardship goes ease, and that the outcome for the one who responds to the command of Allaah is joy and happiness. This joy can only be felt by the one who tastes the sweetness of obedience, like the joy that the fasting person feels when he breaks his fast, or that the one who spends the night in prayer feels after he has prayed. 15-When he has finished the rituals of Hajj and done them as Allaah has prescribed and as He likes, and has completed his rituals, he has the hope that his Lord will forgive him all his sins, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) promised when he said: “Whoever comes to this House and does not utter any obscene speech or do any evil deed, will go back as his mother bore him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1449) and Muslim (1350). This motivates him to turn over a new leaf in his life, free from sin. 16-When he goes back to his wife and children, the joy of meeting them reminds him of the greater joy he will feel when he meets them in the Paradise of Allaah, may He be exalted. This reminds him that true loss is loss of oneself and one's family on the Day of Resurrection, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): The losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Verily, that will be a manifest loss!” [al-Zumar 39:15]. This is what we were able to mention. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The difficulties may be summed up as follows: 1 – Obtaining the visa, because of the large numbers of pilgrims and the small number of visas allocated. 2 – Tawaaf (circumambulation) around the Ka’bah, when there are many people doing Tawaaf and there is too much crowding, especially at the Black Stone. Hence the people should not push and shove in order to kiss or touch the Black Stone, because that may cause harm that is greater than the reward for doing this action. Similarly the Muslim should choose a suitable time for Tawaaf, when it is less crowded and he can do the act of worship in the required manner. The scholars have issued fatwas indicating that it is permissible to do tawaaf on the upper floors of al-Masjid al-Haraam (the Grand Mosque in Makkah), even though that is difficult, because of the greater distance involved – but it is more conducive to performing the act of worship as it should be done, as the Muslim can avoid the pushing and shoving and the bad consequences that may result from that. 3 – Sa’ee between al-Safa and al-Marwah (running between two hills in Makkah called al-Safa and al-Marwah). The same may be said concerning this as was said above concerning Tawaaf, although the place is smaller than the place for Tawaaf. The Muslim can also do Sa’ee on the upper floor to avoid the crowding on the lower floor. 4 – Standing in ‘Arafaah, where all the pilgrims gather together at one time in one place, then all they move on at the same time. This is where most people experience difficulties, whether it is in the standing or when moving on. 5 – Muzdalifah. The difficulties may stem from the absence of services that are available in other places, the most important of which is toilet facilities. Hence pilgrims are advised to eat and drink little in ‘Arafaah and Muzdalifah and on all the days of the Hajj in general, so that they will not need to relieve themselves, then find it difficult to find a suitable place, so they will have problems. 6 – Stoning the Jamaraat (stone pillars representing the devil). This is the most difficult ritual in terms of crowding, and at this time the ignorance of many people becomes manifest when they push and shove their brothers and when they stone the Jamaraat from afar with large rocks that cause harm and injury to their Muslim brothers; some of them are so ignorant that they throw shoes and pieces of wood! Hence we advise the pilgrim to avoid the time of peak crowding, which is the forenoon of the first day of Eid, and the time of Zuhr prayer on the other days of al-Tashreeq (the three days following Eid), and to stone the Jamaraat at night when the crowding becomes far less, and he can also remember Allaah in a calm manner. The scholars have issued fatwas stating that the time for stoning the Jamaraat lasts from after the sun passes the meridian (which is when the time for Zuhr prayer begins) until Fajr (dawn), so there is no need to go at the time when the people gather and cause harm to oneself and others and not be able to focus properly when doing this act of worship. 7 – In Tawaaf al-Wadaa’ (Farewell Tawaaf), when the pilgrims try to leave early to return to their families, so almost all of them gather at the same time, which causes difficulty and harm to them, whether that is in going to the sanctuary, when doing Tawaaf itself or when leaving Makkah. Hence we advise pilgrims to delay this ritual until the third of the days of al-Tashreeq and not to be in a hurry. They will earn a greater reward than those who hurry, and they will avoid the intense crowding in Tawaaf al-Wadaa’. This is a summary of the difficulties that the pilgrims encounter. The wisdom of Allaah dictates that the rituals should be performed in that land where there is little vegetation, and which is very hot, for great reasons, one of which may be so that Allaah may distinguish His slaves from one another, for no one responds to the call of truth except one who is sincere in his intentions towards his Lord. We should realize that these difficulties do not prevent the Muslim from performing this act of worship which Allaah has enjoined in His Book and on the lips of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has told us that the reward will be commensurate with the degree of difficulty; the more difficult it is, the greater the reward will be. It was narrated that the Mother of the Believers ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, the people are going back having done two pilgrimages (Hajj and ‘Umrah), and I am going back having done only one (Hajj – i.e., because her period had come).” He said, ‘Wait, and when you become pure (i.e., when your period ends), go out to al-Tan’eem and enter ihraam from there, then meet us at such and such a place. But it (i.e., the reward) is commensurate with the expenses or hardship involved.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1695; Muslim 1211 Al-Nawawi said: The phrase “But it (i.e., the reward) is commensurate with the expenses or hardship involved” indicates that the reward and the virtue of an act of worship increases the more effort and spending is required. What is meant by hardship is the type of hardship or spending that is not blameworthy or beyond the acceptable limits set by sharee’ah. Sharh Muslim, 8/152, 153 Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar commented on these words by saying: That is undoubtedly correct but this is not always the case. Some acts of worship may be easier than others but they may be of a higher status and bring a greater reward because of the timing, such as spending the night of Laylat al-Qadr in prayer in contrast to spending the other nights of Ramadaan in prayer; or because of the place where they are done, such as praying two rak’ahs in al-Masjid al-Haraam in contrast to praying many rak’ahs elsewhere; or financial acts of worship (i.e., spending for the sake of Allaah) where some acts are of a higher virtue than others; or physical acts of worship such as fard (obligatory) prayers in contrast to naafil (supererogatory) prayers, although the naafil prayer s may be greater in number and more recitation of Qur’aan may be done therein; or a dirhams of zakaah in contrast to spending large amounts in voluntary charity. This was pointed out by al-‘Izz ibn ‘Abd al-Salaam in al-Qawaa’id, where he said: Prayer was the delight of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) but it is difficult for others, but the prayer of others, even though it may be difficult, cannot equal his prayer at all.

A kaafir cannot inherit from a Muslim, according to scholarly consensus, and a Muslim cannot inherit from a kaafir, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A Muslim does not inherit from a kaafir and a kaafir does not inherit from a Muslim. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6262). If a kaafir becomes Muslim before the legacy is shared out, then according to Imaam Ahmad he is allowed to inherit, to encourage him in his Islam. As regards the kuffaar inheriting from one another, according to Imaam Abu Haneefah and Imaam al-Shaafa'i, and according to one opinion narrated from Ahmad, they can inherit from one another even if they belong to different religions, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And those who disbelieve are allies to one another [al-Anfaal 8:73], and because despite the differences in their religions and sects, they are as one in their enmity towards the Muslims.\n",

      "Contents Related What is animal rennet? Is animal rennet halal? Praise be to Allah.What is animal rennet? Before answering this question, it is important to know what rennet is. Al-Fayruzabadi said in al-Qamus al-Muhit (p. 313), under the definition of na fa ha: al-infahah and al-minfahah and al-binfahah all refer to something yellow that is extracted from the stomachs of suckling goat kids. Infahah (rennet) was also defined in al-Mawsu'ah al-Fiqhiyyah as follows: \"Rennet is a yellowish-white substance ([in a skin vessel] - this phrase appears not to fit here) that is extracted from the stomachs of suckling kids or lambs. When a little of this substance is added to milk, it curdles and becomes cheese. In some Arabic-speaking regions, people call this rennet mujabbinah (cheese-maker), and the stomach (from which the rennet is taken) is called kursh if the animal grazes on grass.” Is animal rennet halal? The Islamic ruling concerning rennet is that if it is taken from an animal that has been slaughtered according to Shari'ah, then it is pure (tahir) and can be eaten. This is according to the Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is and Hanbalis. As regards eating rennet taken from an animal that dies naturally, or that was not slaughtered in accordance with Shari'ah, according to the apparent meaning of the opinions reported from the majority of scholars among the Malikis, Shafi'is and Hanbalis, it is impure (najis) and should not be eaten. They base this ruling on the verse (interpretation of the meaning): \"Forbidden to you for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals - cattle-beasts not slaughtered).\" [al-Maidah 5:3] - the rennet becomes impure by virtue of the animal's death, and it is not possible to remove that impurity from it. Imam al-Nawawi said in al-Majmu' (9/68): \"The ummah has agreed that it is permissible to eat cheese so long as it is not mixed with anything impure, such as adding rennet from a source that is not halal because it was not slaughtered according to shari'ah. This ijma' (scholarly consensus) is the evidence for its permissibility.\" The second view, which is that of Abu Hanifah and is one of two opinions narrated from Imam Ahmad, is that rennet from dead animals or animals that were not slaughtered according to Shari'ah is still tahir (pure). This is the opinion which Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah thought most correct in al-Fatawa (21/102), where he said: \"It is more likely that their (the Zoroastrians') cheese is halal , and that the rennet and milk of dead animals is tahir (pure).\" Elsewhere in al-Fatawa (35/154) he said: \"With regard to the cheese made with their (some of the kafir Batini groups') rennet, there are two well-known scholarly opinions, as is the case with the rennet from animals slaughtered by the Zoroastrians and Christians, and rennet from dead animals, of whom it is said that they do not slaughter their animals properly. The schools of Abu Hanifah and Ahmad, according to the other of his two opinions, say that this cheese is halal, because the rennet taken from dead animals is tahir (pure), according to this view, and because the (enzymes in) rennet do not die when the animal dies (so, the concept \"impure containers don't cause the contents of the container to become impure by contact\" ) applies. The schools of Malik, al-Shafi'i and Ahmad, according to the other of his two opinions, state that this cheese is najis (impure), because the rennet is impure according to this view, as they see the milk and rennet of dead animals as impure. In cases where meat is classified as impure because it is not slaughtered properly, the meat is regarded as being the same as dead meat. Both opinions are based on reports narrated from the Sahabah. The first group states that the Sahabah used to eat the cheese of the Zoroastrians, while the second group states that the Sahabah used to eat what they thought was the cheese of the Christians. With regard to this issue, the follower (ordinary Muslim) must follow an 'alim who advises him to follow either of these two opinions.” For more about halal and haram food, please see this category: Food and Nourishment.

      "Praise be to Allah.Before we answer this question we should note an important point, which is that the basic principle regarding colours of clothes for men and women is that all colours are permissible except where there is a shar’i text forbidding a certain colour for men or women. There are shar’i texts which encourage the wearing of certain colours and forbid the wearing of other colours, such as the following: Black: Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was brought some clothes, among which was a small black khameesah [garment]. He said, ‘Who do you think we should give this to?’ The people remained silent. Then he said, ‘Bring me Umm Khaalid,’ and she was carried to him. He took the khameesah in his hand and put it on her, and said, ‘May you live long and wear it out.’ There was a green or yellow mark on it, and he said, ‘O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah (good),’ and sanaah is an Abyssinian word.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, wearing a black turban.” (Reported by Muslim). ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “I made a black burdah (cloak) for the Messenger of Allaah ( ) peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he wore it, but when he sweated in it he detected the smell of wool on it, so he took it off, because he used to like pleasant smells.” (Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Haakim (4/188) said: it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Saheehah (5/168, no. 2136): It is as they said. Abu Dawood named a chapter in his Sunan “Bab fi’l-Suwaad (chapter on black clothes)”. The author of ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (11/126) said: The hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to wear black and that there is nothing makrooh in doing so). Black is permissible for both men and women alike. One of the false innovations (bid’ah) connected to this colour is the practice of deliberately wearing black at times of bereavement, which also involves imitating the Christians. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said (Fataawa Islamiyah, 3/313): “Wearing black at times of bereavement is a false symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement people should do what is commanded in Islam, which is to say ‘Innaa Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon. Allaahumma ajirni fi museebati wa’khluf li khayran minhaa (Truly! To Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. O Allaah, reward me for my calamity and compensate me with something better than it).’ If a person says this with faith and the hope of reward, Allaah will reward him for that and will replace what he has lost with something better.” He also said: “Allocating certain clothes for mourning is an act of bid’ah (innovation) in our opinion, and because it could indicate that a person is discontent with the decree of Allaah.” White: Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he was wearing a white garment and was asleep. I came back to him (later), and he had woken up…” (Reported by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, in a chapter he called Baab al-Thiyaab al-Beed (Chapter on white clothes)). Al-Bukhaari reported that Sa’d said: “I saw on the left of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and on his right two men wearing white clothes on the day of Uhud. I never saw them before or since.” These two men were Jibreel and Mikaa’eel, as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned in al-Fath (10/295). White is a colour recommended (mustahabb) for the living to wear and for the dead to be shrouded in, as was stated in the hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Wear your white clothes, for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.’” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (p. 82)). White is also the preferred colour for men’s ihraam (special garments for Hajj), which consists of an izaar (lower garment) and a rida’ (upper garment). Green: Abu Ramthah said: “I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wearing two green garments.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said, this is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth, and by al-Nisaa’i, 5224). Red: It was reported that wearing pure red is forbidden for men, but not for women, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade mafdam” (reported by Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, 3591). Mafdam is something that is filled with red safflower dye. According to the commentary of al-Sindi on Sunan al-Nisaa’i, mafdam is something that is filled with red. It was reported that if ‘Umar saw a man wearing a garment dyed red with safflower, he would pull him aside and say, “Leave this for the women.” (Reported by al-Tabari). ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said: “A man who was wearing two red garments passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and greeted him with salaam, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not respond.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, and classed as hasan by al-Bazzaar, who said: we know it only through this isnaad, which includes Abu Yahya al-Qattaat, who is a disputed figure). There were several suggestions as to why men are forbidden to wear red, including the following: because it is the dress of the kuffaar because it is the adornment of women, so forbidding it is a way of discouraging the imitation of women because it is vanity and does not befit a decent man to wear it The prohibition applies only to garments that are dyed completely red. Garments that contain another colour such as white, black, etc. are not forbidden. This is how the ahaadeeth that speak about the red hullah should be interpreted, such as the hadeeth of al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5400). The Yemeni hullah usually has stripes of red and another colour, it is not pure red. Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “The clothing (of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)): Abu’l-Waleed told us Shu’bah told us from Abu Ishaaq who heard al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) saying: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.’ The hullah consists of an izaar and a rida’ (lower and upper garments)… It is a mistake to think that it was pure red and not mixed with any other colour. The red hullah is two Yemeni garments woven with red and black stripes like all the other Yemeni garments… But pure red is emphatically forbidden. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is stated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade red saddlecloths (or blankets) … With regard to red garments in general and red broadcloth, etc., the issue is still under discussion, but it is very disliked (makrooh).” (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/139).

      "Praise be to Allah.It is a great thing to learn that you are thinking of embracing Islam, although you live in a country where drugs are rife and are not following any religion at present. We were amazed and impressed to know that a man living in such circumstances has reached the point where he wants to become Muslim, but Allaah is able to do all things, and He guides whom He wills to the Straight Path. Perhaps the Divine care has been preparing you to embrace the true religion in spite of the intense darkness, kufr (disbelief) and drug-ridden atmosphere that surround you. The unbelieving man is dead at heart even though his body is alive, but when Allaah guides him to the light of Islam, his heart awakens and he sees a whole new meaning to life as he starts to follow the guidance of his Lord. Allaah says in His Holy Book (interpretation of the meaning): “Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and faith) and set for him a Light (belief) whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out?…” [al-An’aam 6:122]. So come to true life, and follow the Light which Allaah has revealed, and you will find that which will delight you and bring you peace of mind, when you worship Allaah. As regards the issue of drugs, no doubt you would expect this great religion to forbid everything that is harmful and to permit everything that is beneficial, and not to allow man to lose his mind and go crazy, doing all kinds of foolish things without any awareness and destroying his body. This is what happens when people take drugs and prevent themselves from thinking about or worshipping Allaah. This poison opens the door to hostile aggression, and destroys religion, lives, minds, honour and wealth. And so no wise person can doubt that drugs are totally forbidden. We fully understand that addiction is no straightforward matter and that recovery is no simple process, but this should not prevent you from entering Islam and embracing the way of truth with which Allaah has sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Rest assured that when you embrace Islam, this will give you strength and will-power to overcome this addiction and rid yourself of this disease and sin. All of this may take some time, but this should not make you hesitate to embrace Islam. Become Muslim and you will be safe from the problems of this world and the punishment of the Hereafter. We are prepared to stand by you and help you with any difficulty that you may face. We thank you for your question and ask Allaah to guide you soon. Peace be upon those who follow the truth.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah (God) Almighty, is most merciful and compassionate, without any doubt. Yet his actions can not be fully comprehended by our incompetent minds. What simplifies this issue is that we all agree that Allaah is fair, just, wise and knowing. That means whatever he-Almighty- does, is with a legitimate purpose although we may not be able to understand, just why. For example, a caring and loving doctor and father may be forced to amputate the leg of his only son. There is no doubt that this father loves his son. Yet his action was for the sake of this beloved son, although it may seem cruel to those who do not understand the circumstances. Allah Almighty has the greater and higher example, and it is not to any of his creatures to question his doings as it is mentioned in Sura 21 verse 23 (interpreted means: He cannot be questioned for His acts, but they will be questioned (for theirs). It is a Muslims belief that suffering of pain, hunger, tragic accidents etc, are due to ones sins, for Allaah wants this suffering to erase these sins which were made by this Muslim. Allaah says in Sura 42 verse 30 interpreted means: Whatever misfortune happens to you, is because of the things your hands have wrought, and for many (of them) He grants forgiveness. It is also apparent that man in times of crisis gets closer to Allaah and starts repenting, while in times of ease and comfort he is far from remembering the blessings of Allaah and he uses these gifts and blessings in committing sin after sin. Allaah -Almighty- has shown man the path of good and evil, and he gave him the power and will to choose. Therefore, man is accountable to his deeds and the punishment he receives for them, for life in this world is merely a test, but the results are to be known in the hereafter and Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Rulings related to breastfeeding in Islam Can husband drink milk of wife in Islam? Praise be to Allah.Rulings related to breastfeeding in Islam Before answering this question, we must explain some important points about the rulings concerning breastfeeding . 1. Breastfeeding is proven in the Quran and Sunnah, and by ijma (scholarly consensus). Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… your foster mothers who gave you suck, your foster milk suckling sisters…” [al-Nisa 4:23] Ibn 'Abbas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “What is forbidden by suckling or breastfeeding is the same as what is forbidden by nasab (lineage).” (Agreed upon; al-Bukhari, Muslim, 1444) The scholars agree that the effect of rada’ah (breastfeeding) prohibits marriage and creates the relationship of mahram, and permits seeing and being alone (with the people to whom one is related through rada’ah). 2. For breastfeeding to have the effect of transmitting its benefits from the nursing woman to the child suckled, it must meet certain conditions, which are: 1. The breastfeeding must happen within the first two years of the child’s life, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling…” [al-Baqarah 2:233] 2. The number of breastfeedings must total the known five feeds, in which the child eats his fill as if eating and drinking. If the child leaves the breast for a reason, such as to take a breath or to switch from one breast to the other, this (i.e., each separate time the child latches on) is not counted as one breastfeeding. This is the opinion of al-Shafi'i, and the opinion favoured by Ibn al-Qayyim. The definition of rada’ah (one breastfeeding) is when the child sucks at the breast and drinks until the milk enters his stomach, then he leaves the breast of his own accord. The evidence for the number five (number of breastfeedings) is the report from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who said: “There was in the Quran [an ayah which stipulated that] ten [was the number of] breastfeedings which created the relationship of mahram , then this was abrogated [by another ayah which stipulated] five. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died and [the ayah which stipulated five] was still being recited as part of the Quran.” (Reported by Muslim, 1452). In other words, the abrogation came so late that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died, some people had not yet heard that this ayah had been abrogated, but when they heard that it had been abrogated, they stopped reciting it, and agreed that it should not be recited, although the ruling mentioned in the ayah remained in effect. This is an abrogation of the recitation without abrogation of the ruling, which is one type of abrogation. Having understood this, breastfeeding after the first two years does not create any relationship of mahram. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, and among the references which they quote is the verse cited above, along with the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): “Nothing of breastfeeding creates the relationship of mahram except what fills the stomach to bursting point, before (the age of) weaning.” Reported by al-Tirmidhi. (No. 1152), who said: This is a hasan sahih hadith. The application of this according to the scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and others is that breastfeeding does not create the relationship of mahram except when it is within the first two years, and anything after the first two whole years does not create any such relationship.” There are some other reports from the Sahabah, such as that narrated from Abu ‘Atiyah al-Wadi'i, who said: “A man came to Ibn Mas’ud and said: ‘My wife was with me and her breasts were full of milk (she was engorged). I began to suck it and spit it out. Then I came to Abu Musa.’ He (Ibn Mas’ud) said, ‘What did you tell him?’ So he (Abu Musa) told him what he had told him. Then Ibn Mas’ud stood up, took the man’s hand (and said), ‘Do you think this is an infant? Breastfeeding is what produces the growth of flesh and blood.’ Abu Musa said: ‘Do not ask me anything when this scholar is among you.’” (Reported by ‘Abd al-Razzaq in al-Musannaf, 7/463, no. 13895). In al-Muwatta (2/603), Malik reported that Ibn ‘Umar said: “There is no breastfeeding except for the one who is breastfed in infancy; there is no breastfeeding for one who is grown up.” Its isnad is sahih. Can husband drink milk of wife in Islam? Malik also reported in al-Muwatta that ‘Abd-Allah ibn Dinar said: “A man came to ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar when I was with him in the court-house, asking him about breastfeeding one who is grown up. ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Umar said: ‘A man came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab and said, “I have a slave-girl with whom I used to have sexual relations, and my wife went to her and gave her her milk, then when I went to her, she said, ‘Stop, by Allah I have given her my milk.’” ‘Umar said, “Punish her (your wife), and (continue to) go to your slave-girl, for (the ruling on) breastfeeding only applies to breastfeeding of infants.”’” Its isnad is sahih. From this it is clear that drinking one’s wife’s milk has no effect and does not create the relationship of mahram. Ibn Qudamah said in al-Mughni (9/201): “One of the conditions of breastfeeding creating the relationship of mahram is that it should be within the first two years. This is the opinion of most of the scholars. Something like this was narrated from ‘Umar, ‘Ali, Ibn ‘Umar, Ibn Mas’ud, Ibn ‘Abbas, Abu Hurayrah and the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), apart from ‘Aishah. It was also the opinion of al-Shi’bi, Ibn Shubrumah, al-Awza’i, al-Shaafi’i, Ishaq, Abu Yusuf, Muhammad, and Abu Thawr, and was narrated in one report from Malik. On the basis of the above, drinking one’s wife’s milk has no effect, but it is better to avoid it. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin was asked about this matter, and he replied: “Breastfeeding a grown-up has no effect, because the breastfeeding which has an effect (of creating the relationship of mahram) is that which consists of five feedings or more within the first two years, before weaning. On this basis, if it happened that someone breastfed from his wife or drank her milk, he does not become her son.” (Fatawa Islamiyyah, 3/338) And Allah knows best.\n",

Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad said: I heard ‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), say: I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) say: “There are four things which are fasiq (corrupt) and may be killed at all times, whether one is in a state of ihram [for Hajj and ‘Umrah] or not: kites, crows, mice/rats and mad dogs.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1198) Are mice and rats harmful? Mice and rats are harmful creatures, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained: Ibn 'Abbas said: “A mouse (or rat) came and started dragging the wick (of the lamp). It threw it in front of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), onto the mat on which he was sitting, and it burnt a hole the size of a dirham. He said, “When you go to sleep, extinguish your lamps, for the Shaytan will tell creatures like this to do something like this so that you will be burned.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 5427) The mice or rats that may live in people’s houses are among the harmful creatures or vermin (fuwaysiqah) which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to kill in all situations, whether we are in ihram or not. The root of the word fuwaysiqah (fasaqah) means to deviate from the right way and to do harm; hence a sinner is described as “fasiq”, and these animals are called fawasiq, as a metaphor for their evil nature; or it was said that it is because it is not haram to kill them, whether one is in ihram or not, for they have no sanctity or protection in any circumstances. Al-Tahawi narrated in Ahkam al-Quran with his isnad from Yazid ibn Abu Nu’aym that he [Yazid] asked Abu Sa’id al-Khudri why mice/rats were called fuwaysiqah. He said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) woke up one night and saw that a mouse/rat had taken the wick of the lamp to burn down the house of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), so he got up and killed it, and said that it was permissible to kill them whether one is in ihram or not. This was mentioned by al-‘Allamah al-Dumayri. Al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated in their Sahihs that Abu Musa al-Ash’ari said: A house in Madinah burned down with its people inside. When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard about this, he said: “This fire is an enemy to you, so when you go to sleep, extinguish it.” Al-Bukhari narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Cover the vessels, for the mouse/rat may drag out the wick (of the lamp) and burn the occupants of the house.” Something similar was narrated by Muslim, in which he says: “For the fuwaysiqah may start a fire and burn the house and its occupants.” Al-Tabari said, explaining these ahadith: if a person wants to spend the night in a house in which there is no one else, and in which there is a fire or a lamp, it is a duty on him to extinguish it before he sleeps… The hadith was narrated by al-Hakim; he said its isnad is sahih.

      "Contents Related Types of video games Are video games haram? What are the forbidden elements in games? Praise be to Allah.Types of video games The one who looks at these games will see that they are based on mental skills and individual reactions or decisions. These games are of various types, with many aspects. Some of them take the form of illusionary battles which train a person in what to do in similar circumstances [in real life]. Some other games are based on being alert so as to save oneself from danger; fighting enemies and destroying targets; planning; having adventures; finding the way out of a labyrinth; escaping from wild beasts; racing cars, planes, etc.; overcoming obstacles; searching for treasure. Some games increase knowledge and enhance one's interests, such as games that involve taking things apart and putting them back together, jigsaw puzzles, building things, colouring, and shading and lighting. Are video games haram? Islam does not forbid leisure or having fun in permissible ways. The basic rule concerning these games is that they are permissible so long as they do not get in the way of obligatory duties such as establishing prayer [i.e., praying properly and on time] and honouring one's parents, and so long as they do not include anything that is haram. What are the forbidden elements in games? There are, however, many haram elements in these games, such as the following: Games which depict wars between the people of this world (good guys) and people from the sky (bad guys), with all its implications of accusations against Allah, may He be glorified, or the noble angels. Games which involve sanctifying the cross or passing over or by it to gain strength, to bring one back to life or to give the player extra lives and so on. Also, games which are used for designing birthday cards as in Christian culture are also forbidden. Games which approve of witchcraft/magic, and which glorify witches/magicians/sorcerers, etc. Games which are based on hatred of Islam and Muslims, like the game in which a player gets 100 points if he hits Makkah, 50 points if he hits Baghdad, and so on. Games that glorify the non-Muslims and show pride in belonging to them, like games in which if a player chooses an army belonging to a non-Muslim state he becomes strong, and if he chooses an army belonging to an Arab state he becomes weak. Also, games which teach a child to admire non-Muslim sports clubs and the names of non-Muslim players. Games that include depictions of nudity, and some games that allow the winner to see a pornographic picture; games that corrupt morals, such as games where the idea is to run away with a girlfriend from the bad guys or a dragon. Games based on ideas of gambling. Music and other things that are known to be forbidden in Islam. Physical harm, such as damage to the eyes and nervous system; harmful effects of game sounds on the ears. Modern studies have shown that these games may be addictive and harmful to the nervous system, as well as causing stress and nervous tension in children. Making children get used to violence and criminality, and teaching them to take killing and murder lightly, as in the famous Doom game. Corrupting children’s sense of reality by teaching them about a world of illusions and impossible things, such as coming back from the dead, supernatural powers that do not really exist, images of space aliens, and so on. We have gone into details about some of the ideological dangers and things that are prohibited by Islam because many fathers and mothers do not pay attention to these things, and they bring these games for their children and let them play with them. We should also point out that it is not permissible to compete for prizes in playing these electronic games , even if the game itself is permissible, because they are not a means of jihad, and they do not help you develop strength for jihad.

      "Praise be to Allah.Salaat al-Jumuah (Friday prayer) is not obligatory on the traveller. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars, including the followers of the four schools of Abu Haneefah, Maalik, al-Shaafai and Ahmad Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fataawa (24/178): The correct opinion, without a doubt is that this (Jumuah and Eid prayers) are not obligatory for the traveller. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to travel frequently: he performed Umrah three times, besides the Umrah he performed along with Hajj. He performed his Farewell Pilgrimage accompanied by thousands upon thousands of people, and he went on more than twenty military campaigns, but there are no reports at all that say he prayed Jumuah or Eid prayers when travelling; he just prayed two rakahs [i.e., shortened prayers] as on all the other days. There are also no reports that say he preached a khutbah on a Friday when he was travelling, neither standing on his own two feet or from atop his camel, as he used to do on Eid, or from a minbar, as he used to do on Fridays. He occasionally used to deliver an address to the people when he was travelling, and this was narrated by them but no-one reported that he delivered a khutbah to them before prayer on a Friday whilst travelling, and no-one reported that he recited Quraan aloud on a Friday (i.e., during Salat al-Zuhr, on a journey). Of course, if he had done something out of the ordinary and recited aloud or delivered a khutbah, they would have reported it. On the Day of Arafaah, he delivered a khutbah, then he came down and led them in a two-rakah prayer, but no one reported that he recited aloud in that prayer. That khutbah was not for Jumuah because if it had been for Jumuah, he would have done the same (delivered a khutbah) on every other Friday (when he was travelling); that khutbah was given because it was part of the rituals (of Hajj). Hence all the Muslim scholars said that he would have given a khutbah at Arafaah even if it had not been a Friday. This mutawaatir report proves that it was a khutbah for the Day of Arafaah, not for Friday. From the above we know that Jumuah is not obligatory for the traveller, all that he has to do is to pray Zuhr. However, if he prays Jumuah with the people of the place he is visiting, this is OK. It says in al-Sharh al-Kabeer (2/154): Whoever of these people travellers, slaves and women attends Jumuah, does not have to pray Zuhr, and we know of no dispute on this point. Their exemption from having to attend Jumuah is to make things easy for them, but if they attend, it is OK, as is the case with the sick person. It is preferable for the traveller to attend Jumuah, because this is better, and is on the safe side (because some scholars think that Jumuah is obligatory for the traveller who is staying in a particular place, but not for the traveller who is on the road), as he comes under the general meaning of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! When the call is proclaimed for the Salaah on the Day of Friday (Jumuah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allaah, and leave off business (and every other thing), that is better for you, if you did but know! [al-Jumuah 62:9]. We have already stated that the majority of scholars say that generally speaking it is not obligatory. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.You may pray the duaa of Zakariya (peace be upon him), who said: Rabbi laa tadharni fardan wa anta khayr ul-waaritheen (O my Lord! Leave me not single (childless), though You are the Best of the inheritors). This is a beautiful duaa which is very appropriate in this case. Also suitable is another prayer of Zakariya: Rabbi hab li min ladunka dhurriyyatan tayyibatan innaka samee al-duaa (O my Lord! Grant me from You a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation). The story of Zakariya contains valuable lessons for us. Allaah has told us this story in several places in the Quraan. For example, in Soorat Aal Imraan, where He tells us about Maryam (peace be upon her) He says (interpretation of the meaning): So her Lord (Allaah) accepted her [Maryam] with goodly acceptance. He made her grow in a good manner and put her under the care of Zakariya. Every time he entered al-mihrab [a praying place or private room] to (visit) her, he found her supplied with sustenance. He said, O Maryam! From where have you got this? She said, This is from Allaah. Verily, Allaah provides sustenance to whom He wills, without limit. At that time Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: O my Lord! Grant me from You a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation. Then the angels called him, while he was standing in prayer in al-mihrab, (saying): Allaah gives you glad tidings of Yahya, confirming (believing in) the Word from Allaah [i.e., the creation of Eesaa], noble, keeping away from sexual relations with women, a Prophet, from among the righteous. He said, O my Lord! How can I have a son when I am very old and my wife is barren? Allaah said: Thus Allaah does what He wills. He said: O my Lord! Make a sign for me. Allaah said: Your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals. And remember your Lord much, and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning.[Aal Imraan 3:37-41] In Soorat Maryam, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): (This is) a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His slave Zakariya. When he called out to his Lord (Allaah) a call in secret, Saying, My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head, and I have never been unblest in my invocation to You, O my Lord! And verily! I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir, - Who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Yaqoob [inheritance of religious knowledge and Prophethood]. And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased! (Allaah said): O Zakariya! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son. His name will be Yahya. We have given that name to none before (him). He said, My Lord! How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have reached the extreme old age? He said, So (it will be). Your Lord says: It is easy for Me, Certainly, I have created you before, when you had been nothing! [Zakariya] said: My Lord! Appoint for me a sign. He said, Your sign is that you shall not speak unto mankind for three nights, though having no bodily defect. Then he came out to his people from al-mihrab [a praying-place or private room] and told them by signs to glorify Allaahs Praises in the morning and in the afternoon.[Maryam 19:2-11] In Soorat al-Anbiya, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And (remember) Zakariya, when he cried to his Lord: O my Lord! Leave me not single (childless), though You are the Best of the inheritors. So We answered his call, and We bestowed upon him Yahya, and cured his wife (to bear a child) for him. Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us. [al-Anbiya 21:89-90] Thinking about the story of Zakariya (peace be upon him) is very beneficial for anyone who is infertile. One may also ponder the story of Ibraaheem and his wife Saarah, whom Allaah rewarded for their patience with Ishaaq when Ibraaheem was very old. He was also given another son, Ismaaeel. Allaah tells us that His khaleel (friend) said (interpretation of the meaning): All praises and thanks be to Allaah, Who has given me in old age Ismaaeel and Ishaaq. Verily! My Lord is indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.[Ibraaheem 14:39] In all situations, the Muslim should accept and be content with the decree of Allaah, even if he is to remain infertile for the rest of his life. It could be that his patience may be better for him than a child. Everything that Allaah decrees has wisdom and a reason behind it, and everything is subject to His Will and Command. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): To Allaah belongs the kingdom of the heaven and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills. Or He bestows both males and females, and He renders barren whom He wills. Verily, He is the All-Knower and is Able to do all things. [al-Shoora 42:49-50] May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.What you refer to in your question is mentioned in two similar aayaat in the Qur’aan. The first of them is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.” [al-Baqarah 2:62] The second is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Surely, those who believe, those who are the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians – whosoever believed in Allaah and the Last Day, and worked righteousness, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.” [al-Maa’idah 5:69] In order to understand these aayaat correctly, we need to refer to the scholars of Tafseer (Qur’aanic commentary). The great Imaam Ismaa’eel ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of the aayah from Soorat al-Baqarah: “Allaah, may He be exalted, points out that whoever of the previous nations did well and was obedient, will have a good reward, and this will be the case for everyone who follows the Unlettered Prophet [Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the Hour comes – he will have eternal happiness, and they will not fear what they are going to face, nor will they grieve for what they have left behind. As Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘No doubt! Verily, the awliya’ of Allaah [i.e., those who believe in the Oneness of Allaah and fear Allaah much, and love Allaah much], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.’ [Yoonus 10:62]. And Allaah tells us what the angels say to the believers at the time of death (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Verily, those who say, “Our Lord is Allaah,” then they istaqaamu [stood straight, i.e., truly followed Islam], on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): “Fear not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise which you have been promised!”’ [Fussilat 41:30] As far as the Jews are concerning, their faith meant believing in the Tawraat (original Torah) and following the way of Moosa (peace be upon him) until ‘Eesa came, after which whoever continued to follow the Torah and the way of Moosa, and did not leave this and follow ‘Eesa, was doomed. As far as the Christians are concerned, their faith meant believing in the Injeel (original Gospel) and following the laws of ‘Eesa; whoever did this was a believer whose faith was acceptable to Allaah, until Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came, after which whoever did not follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and leave the way of ‘Eesa and the Injeel that he had been following before, was doomed. The aayah (interpretation of the meaning), “And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:85] is a statement that Allaah will not accept any way or deed from anyone, after sending His Final Messenger, except those that are in accordance with the laws of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Prior to this, however, anyone who followed the Prophet of his own time was on the Straight Path of salvation. So the Jews were those who followed Moosa (peace be upon him) and referred to the Tawraat for judgement at that time. When Allaah sent ‘Eesa (peace be upon him), the Children of Israel were obliged to follow him and obey him, and so they and others who followed him became Christians.. When Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as the Final Prophet and a Messenger to all the children of Adam, all of mankind was obliged to believe in him and obey him, and refrain from what he prohibited. Those who did so are the true believers. The ummah (nation) of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) are called the believers because of their deep eemaan (faith) and conviction, and because they believe in all the past Prophets and in the prophesied events that are yet to come.” Commenting on the aayah in Soorat al-Baqarah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “What is meant is that every group believed in Allaah and the Last Day, which is the appointed Day of Reckoning, and did righteous deeds. But after Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent to both mankind and the jinn, true belief can only be in accordance with the way of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whoever follows his way will not fear the future or grieve for what they leave behind.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The ruling on placing the Mus-haf (copy of the Quraan) in cars to ward off the evil eye and for protection from danger is a bidah. The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) never carried the Mus-haf to ward off danger or the evil eye. If it is bidah, then we should remember that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Every bidah is a going-astray and every going-astray will lead to Hell. (Telephone conversation with Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen) (al-Bida wal-Muhdathaat wa maa laa aslun lahu, p. 259). Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was also asked the following question: Some people hang up aayaat of the Quraan and ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the rooms of their homes or in restaurants or offices. In some hospitals and doctors offices they hang the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And when I am ill, it is He Who cures me [al-Shuara 26:80], and so on. Is this considered to be the use of amulets which is forbidden in shareeah, knowing that the intention behind it is to seek blessings and ward off the shayaateen, or to remind the forgetful and warn the negligent? Is it like using amulets to put the Mus-haf in one's car in order to seek blessings? His Eminence replied as follows: If the intention is as described, to remind people and teach them something beneficial, then there is no harm in that. But if they believe that it is a protection against the shayaateen or jinn, then I know of no basis for this. By the same token, there is no basis for putting the Mus-haf in one's car to protect it, and doing so is not allowed, but if a person puts it in his car so that he can read it sometimes or so that some of his passengers can read it, then this is good and there is nothing wrong with it. And Allaah is the Source of strength.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The whole issue of hiraabah, which is also known as banditry, can be summed up in the following points: Definition of hiraabah Ruling on hiraabah Punishment for hiraabah The reasons for the different types of these punishments Repentance of the muhaarib (person who commits hiraabah) Definition of hiraabah Hiraabah means ambushing people and threatening them with weapons and so on, in the deserts or in the cities, killing them, terrorizing them and seizing their property by force and openly. Wealth is mentioned specifically because this is what usually happens, but the ruling applies also to people who terrorize others for the purposes of rape or sodomy. Ruling on hiraabah Hiraabah is one of the most serious of major sins, and it is forbidden according to the Quraan, the Sunnah and ijmaa (scholarly consensus). Quraan: The Quraan says (interpretation of the meaning): The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter. Except for those who (having fled away and then) come back (as Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power; in that case, know that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Maaidah 5:33] Sunnah: the hadeeth of al-Arniyeen. Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that some people came from Akl or Areenah and avoided Madeenah (i.e., they did not want to stay in Madeenah because they were suffering from a fever). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ordered them to drink the urine and milk of milch-camels (for treatment of their fever). They did that, and when they got better, they killed the shepherd of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and stole the sheep. This news reached (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at the beginning of the day, and he sent people in pursuit of them. At mid-day, they were brought to him and he commanded that their hands and feet should be cut off and their eyes put out, then they were left in al-Harrah begging for water, but no one gave them water. (Agreed upon). Ijmaa: the ummah is agreed that hiraabah is haraam. Punishments for hiraabah The punishment for hiraabah is one of the hudood or punishments prescribed by shareeah, and the punishment varies according to the severity of the crime. This is explained as follows: Whoever kills someone and steals their property, should definitely be killed and crucified, so that everyone will know about him. It is not permitted to forgive him, by the consensus of the scholars, as was reported by Ibn al-Mundhir. Whoever kills but does not steal, should definitely be killed, but not crucified. Whoever steals property but does not kill, his right hand and left foot should be cut off at the same time, then the bleeding should be stopped and he should be released. Whoever merely terrorizes people, but does not kill or steal, should be banished from the land to another country, where he should be detained until he has repented sincerely and is reformed. The evidence for the above is as follows: The words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land [al-Maaidah 5:33]. The report narrated from Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made a peace treaty with Abu Barzah Hilaal ibn Awaymir al-Aslami. Some people came, wanting to embrace Islam, and they were ambushed by the companions of Abu Barzah. Then Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the revelation of the punishment for killing and stealing property, which is to be killed and crucified, and the punishment for killing without stealing, which is to be killed Whoever steals property but does not kill should have his hand and foot from opposite sides cut off. Whoever becomes Muslim, Islam cancels out whatever deeds came before it at the time of shirk. (Tafseer al-Tabari, 10/260-261). The reason for different levels of punishment Different punishments for different degrees of hiraabah have been prescribed for a very important reason. Hiraabah may take different forms, as is well known, it might not involve only killing, or only stealing. It might involve both stealing and killing, or it may involve neither, only terrorizing people. These different forms of crime dictate different forms of punishment. The basic principle in shareeah is that the punishment should fit the crime, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): The recompense for an evil is an evil like thereof [al-Shoora 42:40]. If these punishments did not vary according to the crime, and there was room for choice, this might result in the most severe punishment for one whose crime was the least serious, or the lightest punishment for one whose crime was most heinous, which is a travesty of justice. The fact that punishments vary according to the seriousness of the crime makes perfect common sense. Repentance of the muhaarib If the muhaarib repents, it can only be either of the following two scenarios: Either he repents before he is caught In this case, the punishment for hiraabah no longer applies, and he should be treated like one who is not a muhaarib. The punishment of banishment, amputation, or execution etc., no longer applies, except in cases where the victim or his family have the right to demand retribution. The evidence for this is the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter. Except for those who (having fled away and then) come back (as Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power; in that case, know that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Maaidah 5:33] Or he repents after he is caught In this case the punishment for hiraabah still applies, and indeed the ruler is obliged to carry it out, because the exception mentioned in the aayah clearly applies only to one who repents before he is caught. It is not too difficult for a person who wants to escape the prescribed punishment to feign repentance. This punishment is part of the Islamic shareeah which Allaah has prescribed for every time and place, not just for one particular country or period. The Muslims applied this punishment for hiraabah at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and until the present time. The fact that some of the Roman and Pharaonic punishments were similar to those prescribed by Islamic law is of no particular significance, good or bad. These Islamic punishments cannot be regarded as backward or savage or barbaric at all. Any intelligent person who thinks about the severity of the crime of hiraabah and the resulting lack of security in the cities and on the road, terrorizing of the populace, robbing and killing, will know for sure that this ruling is exactly what these criminals deserve. The one who looks at the way the punishments for hiraabah fit the crime exactly will see that this is the essence of justice. How can it be otherwise when the One Who has prescribed this law is the Almighty, the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the All-Seeing, the Judge, the Just, the All-Aware? He is the Best Disposer of Affairs and the Best of Supporters.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Before we answer this question we should note an important point, which is that the basic principle regarding colours of clothes for men and women is that all colours are permissible except where there is a shar’i text forbidding a certain colour for men or women. There are shar’i texts which encourage the wearing of certain colours and forbid the wearing of other colours, such as the following: Black: Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was brought some clothes, among which was a small black khameesah [garment]. He said, ‘Who do you think we should give this to?’ The people remained silent. Then he said, ‘Bring me Umm Khaalid,’ and she was carried to him. He took the khameesah in his hand and put it on her, and said, ‘May you live long and wear it out.’ There was a green or yellow mark on it, and he said, ‘O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah (good),’ and sanaah is an Abyssinian word.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Makkah, wearing a black turban.” (Reported by Muslim). ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “I made a black burdah (cloak) for the Messenger of Allaah ( ) peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he wore it, but when he sweated in it he detected the smell of wool on it, so he took it off, because he used to like pleasant smells.” (Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Haakim (4/188) said: it is saheeh according to the conditions of the two shaykhs. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Shaykh al-Albaani said in al-Saheehah (5/168, no. 2136): It is as they said. Abu Dawood named a chapter in his Sunan “Bab fi’l-Suwaad (chapter on black clothes)”. The author of ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (11/126) said: The hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to wear black and that there is nothing makrooh in doing so). Black is permissible for both men and women alike. One of the false innovations (bid’ah) connected to this colour is the practice of deliberately wearing black at times of bereavement, which also involves imitating the Christians. Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen said (Fataawa Islamiyah, 3/313): “Wearing black at times of bereavement is a false symbol that has no basis. At times of bereavement people should do what is commanded in Islam, which is to say ‘Innaa Lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon. Allaahumma ajirni fi museebati wa’khluf li khayran minhaa (Truly! To Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return. O Allaah, reward me for my calamity and compensate me with something better than it).’ If a person says this with faith and the hope of reward, Allaah will reward him for that and will replace what he has lost with something better.” He also said: “Allocating certain clothes for mourning is an act of bid’ah (innovation) in our opinion, and because it could indicate that a person is discontent with the decree of Allaah.” White: Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he was wearing a white garment and was asleep. I came back to him (later), and he had woken up…” (Reported by al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh, in a chapter he called Baab al-Thiyaab al-Beed (Chapter on white clothes)). Al-Bukhaari reported that Sa’d said: “I saw on the left of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and on his right two men wearing white clothes on the day of Uhud. I never saw them before or since.” These two men were Jibreel and Mikaa’eel, as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar mentioned in al-Fath (10/295). White is a colour recommended (mustahabb) for the living to wear and for the dead to be shrouded in, as was stated in the hadeeth narrated by Ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Wear your white clothes, for they are the best of your clothes, and shroud your dead in them.’” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz (p. 82)). White is also the preferred colour for men’s ihraam (special garments for Hajj), which consists of an izaar (lower garment) and a rida’ (upper garment). Green: Abu Ramthah said: “I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wearing two green garments.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said, this is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth, and by al-Nisaa’i, 5224). Red: It was reported that wearing pure red is forbidden for men, but not for women, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade mafdam” (reported by Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah, 3591). Mafdam is something that is filled with red safflower dye. According to the commentary of al-Sindi on Sunan al-Nisaa’i, mafdam is something that is filled with red. It was reported that if ‘Umar saw a man wearing a garment dyed red with safflower, he would pull him aside and say, “Leave this for the women.” (Reported by al-Tabari). ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said: “A man who was wearing two red garments passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and greeted him with salaam, but the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not respond.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi, and classed as hasan by al-Bazzaar, who said: we know it only through this isnaad, which includes Abu Yahya al-Qattaat, who is a disputed figure). There were several suggestions as to why men are forbidden to wear red, including the following: because it is the dress of the kuffaar because it is the adornment of women, so forbidding it is a way of discouraging the imitation of women because it is vanity and does not befit a decent man to wear it The prohibition applies only to garments that are dyed completely red. Garments that contain another colour such as white, black, etc. are not forbidden. This is how the ahaadeeth that speak about the red hullah should be interpreted, such as the hadeeth of al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5400). The Yemeni hullah usually has stripes of red and another colour, it is not pure red. Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “The clothing (of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)): Abu’l-Waleed told us Shu’bah told us from Abu Ishaaq who heard al-Bara’ (may Allaah be pleased with him) saying: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was of average height. I saw him wearing a red hullah, and I have never seen anything better than it.’ The hullah consists of an izaar and a rida’ (lower and upper garments)… It is a mistake to think that it was pure red and not mixed with any other colour. The red hullah is two Yemeni garments woven with red and black stripes like all the other Yemeni garments… But pure red is emphatically forbidden. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari it is stated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade red saddlecloths (or blankets) … With regard to red garments in general and red broadcloth, etc., the issue is still under discussion, but it is very disliked (makrooh).” (Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/139).

If she then complies, then praise be to Allah. If she does not comply, then do not let her enter, because of the fitnah (temptation) and evil involved in her actions.

      "Praise be to Allah.If what your wife has recently told you is what really happened, then she has committed a major sin and an act of clear betrayal by giving in to this attacker and not trying to escape or stop him or call for help and so on. Her claim that she was forced to do it is not acceptable, because she makes no mention of being threatened with a weapon or being tied up, etc. If this is indeed the case, and she clearly did not try to defend herself, then what should you do and how should you regard her? There is no doubt that you should warn her and remind her about Allaah and the Last Day and its horrors, and explain to her the seriousness of overstepping the limits set by Allaah and betraying one’s spouse. You should also remind her of the terrible punishment dictated by sharee’ah for the married person who commits adultery, which is stoning to death. After warning her in this fashion, if you see that she regrets what she did and is striving to be righteous, there is nothing wrong with staying with her, and your marriage will still be valid. It seems most likely that this woman is indeed sorry for what she did and has repented, because she is the one who has brought up the subject after it had been forgotten, and she has told you about it. Perhaps this is because of her guilty conscience and sincere desire to seek forgiveness from her husband. The sin that she committed when she was very young and living in the ignorant environment of America, and where she may have resisted at the beginning of the attack, then softened, is nothing like the sin of a woman who goes out of her way to commit it, and plans to do it deliberately. Our advice is that if this woman is now righteous and truly regrets what she did, then you should forgive her, especially as you may by now have children who will suffer if you divorce her. At the same time, you should continue to teach her, keep an eye on her and not stay away from her for too long. We ask Allaah to acceptance repentance from us all. Finally, I want to address a serious matter that you refer to in the second part of your question, which is the fact that you say you no longer want to go to the mosque or pray or make du’aa’, because of the crisis that you are facing. This is very strange, for whenever the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was faced with a serious matter he would turn to prayer and ask Allaah to help him, and he taught us to do likewise. We should not turn away from the houses of Allaah (mosques) or stop praying and making du’aa’. Where else can you turn in times of trouble and who else can you ask for protection in this crisis? Turn back to Allaah, my brother, ask Him to relieve your distress and seek His help with patience and prayer, for Allaah is with those who are patient.\n",

In this case you should advise him to fear Allaah and not to try to issue fatwas without knowledge. If he had advised you to make sure that your wife travelled with a mahram it would have been better. We ask Allaah to give you strength, blessing and happiness in your marriage.

      "Contents Related Hajj during pregnancy Hajj rituals that a pregnant woman can’t do When going to Hajj poses a risk to a pregnant woman, can she go? Praise be to Allah.Hajj during pregnancy There is no reason why a pregnant woman should not perform Hajj. A pregnant woman is tahir (pure), she has to pray and fast, and if she is divorced by talaq, her divorce is acceptable according to the Sunnah. It is narrated in the Sunnah that Asma bint ‘Umays (may Allah be pleased with her) went out for Hajj with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when she was pregnant and approaching full term, and she gave birth at the miqat. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “Asma bint ‘Umays – the wife of Abu Bakr – gave birth to Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in Shajarah and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told Abu Bakr to tell her to do ghusl and enter ihram. (Narrated by Muslim, 1209) Shajarah refers to Dhu’l-Hulayfah, i.e., the miqat from which the people of Madinah enter ihram. Al-Nawawi said, concerning what we learn from this hadith: “This indicates that the ihram of women who are bleeding following childbirth or who are menstruating is valid and that it is mustahabb for them to do ghusl before entering ihram. There is scholarly consensus that it is obligatory, but our view and that of Malik, Abu Hanifah and the majority of scholars is that it is mustahabb. Al-Hasan and the Zahiri madhhab said that it is obligatory. All the actions of Hajj on the part of women who are bleeding following childbirth or who are menstruating are valid, apart from Tawaf and the two rak’ahs following tawaf, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Do what the pilgrims do but do not do tawaf.” (Sharh Muslim, 8/133) Hajj rituals that a pregnant woman can’t do If a woman has not yet done the obligatory Hajj, then pregnancy is not an excuse for her not to do Hajj, because she can avoid the places where there is too much crowding and pushing and shoving. If she is unable to stone the Jamarat herself, she can delegate someone to do so on her behalf. If she cannot do tawaf and sa’i, then she can do so in a wheelchair, and so on. Many people manage to do Hajj in comfort without any hardship. When going to Hajj poses a risk to a pregnant woman, can she go? If a woman is pregnant and trustworthy doctors tell her that going for Hajj will pose a risk to her or her baby because she is sick or weak or for some other reason, then she should be prevented from doing Hajj that year. This is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), “There should be no harming nor reciprocating harm.” (Narrated by Ibn Majah, 2340; this is a hasan hadith. For details of its isnad, please see Jami’ al-‘Uloom wa’l-Hikam by Ibn Rajab, 1/302) Some doctors differentiate between early pregnancy, when there may be a risk to the foetus, and late pregnancy when such fears are groundless.

      "Praise be to Allah.The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No man is ever alone with a woman (khulwah) but the Shaytaan is the third one with them.” (Reported by Ahmad and by al-Tirmidhi in his Sunan, 2091; Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2546). Allaah says in the story of Yoosuf, peace be upon him (interpretation of the meaning): “And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him (to do an evil act), she closed the doors and said, ‘Come on, O you’…” [Yoosuf 12:23] It is not permitted for a man to be alone with a woman to whom he is not related, whether this is in a house, office, clinic, elevator, car or any other place, because this may be the cause of him doing something haraam. Shaytaan is keen to tempt people and make them fall into haraam deeds. The fuqaha’ are agreed that khulwah or being alone with a woman to whom one is not related is forbidden. They said: “No man should be alone with a woman who is not his mahram (a close relative to whom marriage is forbidden) or his wife, but is a stranger to him, because the Shaytaan will whisper to them and tempt them to do something that is not permitted. (Al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, 19/267) It is not permitted for a man to be alone with a non-mahram woman even if he is teaching her Qur’aan, or to lead her in prayer if only the two of them are present. The guideline regarding khulwah is that this prohibition applies in any situation where their figures are hidden from other people (Fath al-Baari, 9/333). A taxi driver is bound to pass through empty streets or highways, and the structure of the car conceals most of the body of a person riding in it. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a forbidden conversation will not take place, or that there will not be an agreement to do something forbidden. How many tragedies and painful stories and disasters have occurred because of a driver being alone with a female passenger! The wise sharee’ah of Islam has taken all precautions to avoid anything that may lead to wrongdoing. It is essential to completely avoid any situation where a man and woman who are not related may be alone together. A taxi driver should not accept a female passenger who is alone, except in cases of emergency such as accidents and the like. And Allaah is the Source of strength.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Al-Tirmidhi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his Sunan: Ibn Abi Umar told us, Sufyaan told us from Ismaaeel ibn Umayyah who said: I heard a Bedouin Arab man say, I heard Abu Hurayrah say, narrating this, Whoever recites Wal-teeni wal-zaytoon (By the fig, and the olive) [al-Teen 95:1 interpretation of the meaning] then recites Alaysa Allaahu bi ahkam il haakimeen (Is not Allaah the Best of judges?) [al-Teen 95:8 interpretation of the meaning], let him say, Balaa wa ana ala dhaalika min al-shaahideen (Yes indeed, and I am one of those who testify to that). Abu Eesa said: This hadeeth was narrated with this isnaad from this Bedouin from Abu Hurayrah, but his name is not given. Thus al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on him) explained the fault in this isnaad, which is the fact that this Bedouin is not known (jahaalah). On this basis, the isnaad is daeef (weak), and the hadeeth is not saheeh. Abu Dawood (may Allaah have mercy on him) also narrated this report (753) from the same Bedouin. Al-Allaamah al-Albaani also classed the hadeeth as daeef in his book Daeef al-Jaami, no. 5784. As the hadeeth is not proven, we cannot follow it. And Allaah knows best.\n",

We advise you to listen to broadcasts from the Al-Qur’aan Al-Kareem station, because there is much knowledge and sound teaching to be gained from it.

For your benefit and that of other readers, in sha Allaah, we have discussed the issue of vows, their various types and the basic rulings on vows in Question # 2587. Another point related to your question is that a vow is only binding if it is expressed verbally or by one's actions. If a person only has the intention in his heart, this does not make it obligatory for him to fulfil the vow. One must also beware of making vows that are bidah (innovations) or vows to visit places that it is haraam to visit.

Hence it is not permissible to deal with this kind of product where what is being sold is not known, either by sight or by description, because it is a kind of deceptive sale such as was forbidden in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade sales of deception.

      "Praise be to Allah.Everything is standing in its position by the permission of Allaah, whether it be the heavens and all that is in them or the earth and all that is on it – even the rock which you asked about. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “Verily, Allaah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that could grasp them after Him…” [Faatir 35:41] “And among His Signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His Command…” [al-Room 30:25] The Rock in Bayt al-Maqdis is not suspended in space with air around it on all sides; it is attached to the side of the mountain of which it is a part and by which it is supported; both it and the mountain stand in their positions because of the well-known physical laws governing the universe; in this regard it is like everything else that exists. We do not deny that Allaah is Able to hold part of His creation in space; all of creation is standing in space by the power of Allaah, as stated above. Allaah raised the mountain above the people of Moosa when they refused to follow the laws that Moosa brought them. It was held up by the power of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) when We took your Covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying): ‘Hold fast to that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein so that you may become al-muttaqoon (the pious).” [al-Baqarah 2:63] “And (remember) when We raised the mountain over them as if it had been a canopy, and they thought that it was going to fall on them. (We said): ‘Hold firmly to what We have given you, and remember that which is therein, so that you may fear Allaah and obey Him.” [al-A’raaf 7:171] But our point here is to explain what is in fact the case: the rock in Jerusalem is not suspended in space, completely separate from the mountain; it is attached to it and is supported by it.

      "Praise be to Allah.Both the sperm and the ovum are alive in a sense which, if they are free from defects, prepares each of them to join with the other, if Allaah wills and decrees it to happen. When that happens, if Allaah wills it, the embryo is formed and is also alive in a manner that suits it and prepares it to grow and develop, moving through the known stages. When the soul is breathed into it, it becomes alive in another sense, by the permission of Allaah, the Subtle One, the Aware. No matter how a man tries, even if he is a highly-skilled doctor, he can never comprehend all the secrets and stages of development of pregnancy. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “Allaah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due) proportion. All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Most Great, the Most High.” [al-Ra’d 13:8-9] “Verily, Allaah! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs…” [Luqmaan 31:34] (Fataawa Islamiyyah li’l-Lajnah al-Daa’imah, 488). Life is of varying kinds, and each being is alive in a manner that suits it by the power of Allaah. So plants are alive in a manner that suits them, sperm is alive in a manner that suits it, and man is alive in a manner that suits him, and so on. Allaah is the Creator of all this, and He has made water the basis of every living thing, as He says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece, then We parted them? And We have made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?” [al-Anbiya’ 21:30] And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: selling decorative birds like parrots, colourful birds and nightingales for their voices is permissible, because looking at them and listening to them is something that is permissible. There is no text in the sharee’ah which forbids selling them or collecting them; however there are texts which may be understood as meaning that it is permissible to keep them in cages, so long as they are fed and watered and given whatever care is needed. Among these texts is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari from Anas, who said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was the best of people in attitude. I had a brother called Abu ‘Umayr, who had just been weaned, I think. When (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) came, he would say, ‘O Abu ‘Umayr, what happened to the nughayr?’ – a nughar [young sparrow or small bird] with which he used to play.” This nughar is a type of bird. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in his commentary (Fath al-Baari), when enumerating the things that we learn from this hadeeth: “… it is permissible for children to play with birds; it is permissible for parents to allow their children to play with things with which it is permissible to play; it is permissible to spend money on permissible things to entertain children; it is permissible to keep a bird in a cage or to clip a birds’ wings – for one or the other must have been the case with Abu ‘Umayr’s bird, and whichever one it was, the other is also implied in the ruling. There is also the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), in which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A woman entered Hell because of a cat which she detained but she did not give it food or water, and she did not let it free so that it could eat of the vermin of the earth.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari in al-Saheeh, 4/100,152; Ahmad, 2/261). If this is permissible in the case of cats, then it is also permissible in the case of birds etc. Some scholars believed it to be makrooh to keep them in cages. Some believed that it was not allowed, and said: because people do not need to listen to their voices and look at them. This is an unnecessary luxury and soft living, and it is also foolishness because it means that one is enjoying the voice of a creature that is calling out in longing to be allowed to fly and grieving that it cannot fly freely in the open air – as was stated in the book Al-Furoo’ wa Tasheehuh by al-Mirdaawi, 4/9, and al-Insaaf, 4/275. Secondly: among the conditions of valid sales is that the thing to be sold is something which it is permissible to use and benefit from, even if there is no necessity as such. There is no benefit in snakes, which are indeed harmful, so it is not permissible to buy or sell them. The same applies to lizards – there is no benefit in them, so it is not permissible to sell or buy them. Thirdly: it is not permissible to sell predators such as wolves, lions, foxes or any other fanged carnivore, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade that, and because it is a waste of money, which was also forbidden by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).\n",

Another report adds a sixth, snakes. Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that they are harmful pests, and that they are unlike other animals which do not do harm, and so he told us to kill them whether we are in ihraam or not.

If he mixes righteous deeds and bad deeds, and dies as a Muslim, then his fate is up to Allaah: if He wills, He will forgive him, if He wills, He will punish him, and his eventual admission to Paradise will be by the Grace and Mercy of Allaah. As for the hadeeth which says that an illegitimate person will not enter Paradise, this is a fabrication (falsely attributed to the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)).

If you commit a sin, say “Astaghfir-Allaah (I ask Allaah for forgiveness).” If you are given a blessing, say, “Al-Hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allaah).” If some disaster befalls you, say, “Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return).” Seek rizq (provision) by giving charity “Give food to others and speak good.” “Seek a response to du’aa’s when the iqaamah for prayer is given and when rain is falling.” The people with the longest necks on the Day of Resurrection will be the muezzins. “Worship Allaah as if you see Him.” “The most helpless of people are those who cannot make du’aa’.” “The most miserly of people are those who are stingy with their salaams (i.e., do not greet others).” “Pay the hired worker his wages before his sweat dries.” “Tie up (your camel) [i.e., take the necessary precautions], and put your trust in Allaah.” “Make the most of your life before your death.” Make the most of “your health before your sickness.” Make the most of “your free time before you become busy.” Make the most of “your wealth before you become poor.” Make the most of “your youth before you become old.” “The best of dhikr is ‘La ilaaha ill-Allaah.’” “The best of sadaqah (charity) is that given by one who has little.” “The upper hand (the one that gives) is better than the lower hand (the one that takes).” The best of earnings is a good sale. “The best of the believers is one who is best in attitude.” “The best of the muhaajireen is the one who forsakes (hajara) that which Allaah has prohibited.” “The best type of jihaad is the jihaad of the one who strives against his own self (jihaad al-nafs) for the sake of Allaah.” “Read the Qur’aan throughout every month.” “Read the Qur’aan, for it will come and intercede for its readers on the Day of Resurrection.” “Pray for Allaah to keep you safe and sound.” “Most of the sins committed by the son of Adam are sins of the tongue.” “Repeat often ‘Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa billaah (there is no power or strength except with Allaah)’, for it is from the treasure of Paradise.” “Always remember the destroyer of joy (physical pleasure): death.” “Lower your gaze and guard your private parts.” “There is no goodness in the one who is not friendly or likeable.” “Stay with her (the mother), for Paradise is under her feet.” “Keep saying ‘Yaa Dhaa’l-jalaali wa’l-ikraam (O Possessor of Glory and Honour)’” i.e., keep repeating it persistently. “Islam cancels out what came before it (of sins).” “Every bid’ah (innovation) is a going astray and every going astray will end in Hell.” “Control your tongue, let your house be enough for you, and weep for your sins.” “(Take care of) your mother, then your mother, then your mother, then your father, then other relatives in order of closeness.” “Feed the poor and pat the head of the orphan (i.e., show compassion).” “The one who points the way to good deeds is like the one who does them.” This is a list of useful sayings and general rules, which we ask Allaah to make of benefit to people. When you have finished sending them out, if you would like more, just let us know so that we can compile some more. And Allaah is the Source of strength.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. Some scholars say that it is permissible to use the masbahah (prayer beads), but they say that it is preferable to do tasbeeh (count praises) on one’s fingers; others say that it is bid’ah (reprehensible innovation). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said in al-Fatawa (22/187): “Some of them might show off by putting their prayer-mats over their shoulders and carrying their masbahahs in their hands, making them symbols of religion and prayer. It is known from the mutawatir reports (reports in such large numbers that they couldn’t be forged) that neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) nor his Companions used these as symbols. They used to recite tasbeeh and count on their fingers, as the hadeeth says: “Count on your fingers, for they will be asked, and will be made to speak.” Some of them may count their tasbeeh with pebbles or date stones. Some people say that doing tasbeeh with the masbahah is makrooh (disliked), and some allow it, but no one says that tasbeeh with the masbahah is better than tasbeeh with the fingers.” Then he (may Allah have mercy on him) goes on to discuss the issue of showing off with the masbahah, saying that it is showing off with regard to something that is not prescribed by Islam, which is worse than showing off with regard to something that is prescribed. Al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymeen (al-Liqa al-Maftooh, 3/30) was asked whether using the masbahah for tasbeeh is bid’ah, and his reply was: “It is better not to do tasbeeh with the masbahah, but it is not bid’ah, because there is a basis for it, which is the fact that some of the Sahabah (Companions) did tasbeeh with pebbles. But the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught us that tasbeeh with the fingers is better, as he said, ‘Count with the fingertips, for they will be made to speak.’ Doing tasbeeh with the masbahah is not haram (impermissible) or bid’ah, but it is better not to do it, because the one who does tasbeeh with the masbahah has shunned something better. Using the masbahah may also be contaminated with some element of showing off, because we see some people carrying masbahahs that contain a thousand beads, as if they are telling people, ‘Look at me, I do a thousand tasbeehs!’ Secondly, those who use the masbahah for tasbeeh are usually absent-minded and not focused, so you see them doing tasbeeh with the beads, but their gaze is wandering all over the place, which indicates that they are not really concentrating. It is better to do tasbeeh with one’s fingers, preferably using the right hand rather than the left, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to count his tasbeeh on his right hand. If a person counts his tasbeeh using both hands, there is nothing wrong with that, but it is better to use the right hand only.” Al-Shaykh Muhammad Nasir al-Deen al-Albani said in Al-Silsilat al-Da’eefah (1/110), where he quotes the (weak) hadeeth “What a good reminder is the subhah [masbahah],” “In my view, the meaning of this hadeeth is invalid for a number of reasons: Firstly, the subhah [masbahah] is bid’ah and was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). It happened after that, so how could he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) have encouraged his Sahabah to do something that was unknown to them? The evidence for what I have said is the report narrated by Ibn Waddah in Al-Bid’ wa’l-Nahy ‘anha from al-Salt ibn Bahram, who said: ‘Ibn Mas’ood passed by a woman who had a [masbahah] with which she was making tasbeeh, and he broke it and threw it aside, then he passed by a man who was making tasbeeh with pebbles, and he kicked him then said, “You think you are better than the Sahabah, but you are following unjustified bid’ah! You think you have more knowledge than the Companions of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)!”’ Its isnad (chain of transmission) is saheeh (authentic) to al-Salt, who is one of the trustworthy (thiqah) followers of the Tabi’een (Successors). Secondly, it goes against the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr (may Allah be pleased with him) said, ‘I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) counting the tasbeeh on his right hand.’” He also said (1/117): “If there is only one bad thing about the masbahah, which is that it takes the place of the Sunnah of counting on the fingers, even though all are agreed that counting on the fingers is preferable, then that is bad enough. How rarely I see people counting their tasbeeh on their fingers! Moreover, people have invented so many sophisticated ways of following this bid’ah, so you see the followers of one of the [Sufi] tareeqahs (orders) wearing the masbahah around their necks! Or some of them counting with the beads whilst talking or listening to you! Or another one – the like of whom I have not seen for some time – riding his bicycle through a street crowded with people, with the masbahah in one of his hands! They are showing the people that they are not distracted from the remembrance of Allah for even an instant, but in many cases this bid’ah is a cause of their neglecting what is obligatory (wajib). It has happened many times – to others as well as myself – that when I greet one of these people with salam, they answer only by waving and not by saying the words of the greeting. The bad results of this bid’ah are innumerable, and no one can say it better than the poet: ‘All goodness is in following that which went before (the salaf) All badness is in the innovations of those who came later.’” And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. We constantly advise people, when reading texts that appear to present a problem, to examine all versions and isnaads of these ahaadeeth, and to refer to the words of scholars and commentators, because they have the knowledge and understanding that can dispel the confusion. In the following discussion we will quote several versions of the hadeeth as reported by al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him), then we will give a summary from the commentary on the hadeeth by al-Haafiz Ahmad ibn ‘Ali ibn Hajar al-‘Asqallaani (may Allaah have mercy on him) from his book Fath al-Baari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhaari, and from the commentary of Imam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) on the same hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim. ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar reported that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab saw a hullah siyara’ [a type of two-piece garment] at the door of the mosque and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, why don’t you buy this and wear it on Fridays and when the delegations come to you?” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “This is only worn by one who has no share in the Hereafter.” Then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was brought a number of garments [hullahs] of the same type. He gave one of them to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) and ‘Umar said, “O Messenger of Allaah, are you giving it to me to wear it when you said what you said about the hullah of ‘Utaarid (the vendor of the first hullah)?” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I am not giving it to you to wear it.” So ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) gave it to a brother of his in Makkah who was a mushrik.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 837). According to another report: “[The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said:] Sell it and benefit from its price.” Al-Bukhaari, 896. According to another report: “I did not send it to you for you to wear it, for it is worn only by one who has no share in the Hereafter. I sent it to you so that you could benefit from it – i.e., by selling it.” Al-Bukhaari, 1962. According to another report: “Umar said: ‘How can I wear it when you said what you said about it?’ He said, ‘I did not give it to you for you to wear it; sell it or give it to someone else.’ So ‘Umar sent it to a brother of his among the people of Makkah, before he [the brother] became Muslim.” Al-Bukhaari, 2426. According to another report: “He said: ‘Sell it and spend the money on your own needs.’” Al-Bukhaari, 2826. According to another report: “He said: ‘I sent it to you so that you could make some money from it.’” Al-Bukhaari, 5617. Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Concerning the phrase, ‘Why don’t you buy it and wear it?’ – it is as if ‘Umar wanted the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to buy it and wished that he would do so. ‘This is only worn’ – according to the report of Jareer ibn Haazim, he said, ‘silk is only worn’. ‘One who has no share’ – Maalik added in his report, ‘in the Hereafter.’ This could mean the one who has no share in the Hereafter, i.e., of silk clothes. ‘He gave it to him’ – it is apparent from the rest of the hadeeth that he did not give it to him to wear, or it could mean that he gave him something that could be used for clothing. [The verb used, kasaa, has the sense of covering or clothing]. According to the report of Maalik, ‘Then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was brought a number of similar hullahs, and he gave one to ‘Umar.’ In another report, ‘Later on some hullahs (of the same type) were brought to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he sent one to ‘Umar and one to Usaamah ibn Zayd, and gave one to ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib.’ ‘Sell it and spend the money on your own needs’ – means benefit from its price, or it could mean trade it or exchange it, or some more general meaning. (Note): the reason why this hadeeth was included in Baab al-Hareer li’l-nisa’ (Chapter on silk for women) is because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to ‘Umar, ‘sell it or use it for clothing.’ Silk is forbidden for men, and there is no difference between ‘Umar and other men in that regard, so the permission to give it to someone else to wear applies only if it is given to a woman. The fact that ‘Umar gave it to his brother should not be a source of confusion to those who believe that the minor issues of sharee’ah apply to kaafirs too, as ‘Umar gave it to his brother to sell it or to give it to a woman to wear. In some versions of the hadeeth… Ibn ‘Umar said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw ‘Utaarid wearing a silk garment and he disliked that for him, then he gave ‘Umar a similar garment…’ and ‘… [he said,] “I did not give it to you to wear it, I gave it to you to give to women to wear.”’ This is an indication that it is permissible for women to wear pure silk. Imaam Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh that Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) one day wore a coat of silk brocade that had been given to him, but soon afterwards he took it off and sent it to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab. It was said to him, “But you took it off so quickly, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said, “Jibreel forbade me to wear it.” Then ‘Umar came to him, weeping, and said, “O Messenger of Allaah, you disliked something and gave it to me. What is wrong with me?” He said, “I did not give it to you to wear it, I gave it to you to sell it.” So he sold it for two thousand dirhams.’ (Reported by Muslim, 3861).” Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on Saheeh Muslim: “In the hadeeth of ‘Umar about this hullah there is evidence that silk is forbidden for men and permitted for women, that it is permissible to give it, that its price is permitted, and that a Muslim is permitted to give a kaafir clothes and other things. ‘So ‘Umar gave it to a mushrik brother of his in Makkah’ – this is how it was reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. According to a report narrated by al-Bukhaari in some chapter, ‘‘Umar sent it to a brother of his among the people of Makkah, before he [the brother] became Muslim’ – this indicates that he (the brother) subsequently became Muslim… This also indicates that it is permissible to maintain family ties with kaafirs and to treat them well, and that it is permissible to give gifts to kaafirs. The permission to give silk clothes to men does not mean that they should wear them. Some may misinterpret this to mean that kaafir men are permitted to wear silk, but this is incorrect. The hadeeth describes giving a gift to a kaafir, but does not give them permission to wear silk. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent silk garments to ‘Umar, ‘Ali and Usaamah (may Allaah be pleased with them), but this does not mean that they were permitted to wear silk; he stated quite clearly that he was giving it to them so that they could benefit from it in some way other than by wearing it. The correct opinion, which is that of the majority of scholars, is that the minor issues of sharee’ah apply equally to kaafirs, so they are forbidden to wear silk just as Muslims are. And Allaah knows best. Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported another hadeeth on the same issue from al-Miswar ibn Makhramah, who said that his father Makhramah said to him: ‘O my son, I have heard that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has received some coats and he is sharing them out, so let us go to him.’ So we went and found the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in his house. [My father] said to me, ‘O my son, call the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for me.’ I felt too embarrassed, so I said, ‘Should I call the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) for you?’ He said, ‘O my son, he is not arrogant.’ So I called him, and he came out carrying a coat of silk brocade with gold buttons. He said, ‘O Makhramah, we kept this for you,’ and he gave it to him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Kitaab al-Libaas, Baab al-Muzarrar bi’l-Dhahab). Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the hadeeth: “ ‘He came out carrying a coat of silk brocade with gold buttons’ – it is possible that this happened before silk was prohibited, but after silk and gold were prohibited for men, this report can no longer be used as evidence by those who want to permit these things. It is also possible that this happened after these things were prohibited, in which case the garment was given so that the recipient could benefit from it either by selling it or by giving it to women to wear.” In brief, then, the answer to the matter raised in the question is that so long as a silk garment has some legitimate use, such as clothing for women, then it is permissible to sell it and take the money paid for it. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Contents Related What is Zina? Zina: A Grave sin in Islam Degrees of zina Punishment for zina What leads to zina? Will adulterers be forgiven? How can you seek repentance from zina? Praise be to Allah.What is Zina? Zina, in Arabic, means immorality, and is used with two meanings in Shari`ah: a general meaning and a specific meaning. The general meaning includes that which carries the punishment (hadd) and that which does not carry it. Islam does not give the name of Zina only to that which carries the punishment, which is just one of many types of Zina. Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: I have never heard any better definition of small faults [al-Najm 53:32] than that which Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Allah has decreed for every son of Adam his share of Zina, and there is no way to escape from it. The Zina of the eye is a glance, the Zina of the tongue is speaking, and the Zina of the mind is wishing and hoping; then the private part either acts upon this or it does not. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 11/26; Muslim, 4/2046). Al-Bukhari included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled Bab Zina al-jawarih doon al-farj (Chapter on the Zina of faculties other than the private part). Al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Zina is not always associated with the private part itself, but may involve other faculties such as the eyes and so on. Ibn Battal (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Looking and speaking are called Zina because they lead to real Zina. This is why he said that the private part either acts upon this or it does not Zina: A Grave sin in Islam Zina is one of the forbidden deeds, one of the most serious major sins (kabair) after shirk and murder. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): “And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such life as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse and whoever does this shall receive the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace; except those who repent and believe and do righteous deeds, for those Allah will change their sins into good deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [al-Furqan 25:68-70] “And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a fahishah [anything that transgresses its limits a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him).” [al-Isra 17:32] Imam al-Qurtubi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The scholars said that the phrase ‘And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse’ is more eloquent than merely saying Do not commit Zina, because the meaning is, Do not even come close to Zina. This means not doing any deed that may get close to Zina or lead to it, such as being alone with a member of the opposite sex, touching, looking, going to evil places, speaking in a haraam manner to a woman to whom one is not related, thinking about and planning immoral acts, and so on. Abd-Allah ibn Masood said: I asked the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Which sin is worst in the sight of Allah? He said, To make any rival to Allah, when He has created you. I asked, Then what? He said, To kill your child for fear that he will eat with you. I asked, Then what? He said, To commit Zina with the wife of your neighbour. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 8/492; Muslim, 1/90). All religions are agreed that Zina is haram; no religion allows it. The punishment for Zina is the most severe of punishments, because it violates peoples’ honour and lineages. Degrees of zina The sin of Zina may be of varying degrees, and the gravity of the offence depends on the nature and circumstances of the deed, although all Zina is haram, a major sin and an act of immorality. Zina with a mahram [i.e., incest] (Allah forbid) or with a married woman is far worse than Zina with a woman to whom one is not related or with an unmarried woman, because it involves violating the rights of the husband, contaminating his bed, attributing a child to him that is not his, and other kinds of offence and harm. If her husband is a neighbour, the crime of being a bad neighbour is added to the offence. If her husband is one's brother or relative, the crime of breaking family ties is added. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: He will not enter Paradise whose neighbour is not safe from his evil actions. (Reported by Muslim, 1/68). There is no evil action worse than Zina, and if the husband is absent for the sake of Allah, such as in worship, seeking knowledge or jihaad, then the sin is compounded. Buraydah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The wives of the mujahideen are as sacred and forbidden to those who stay behind as their own mothers. There is no man of those who stay behind who is entrusted by one of the mujahideen with the care of his family and then betrays him (by committing Zina), but he will be detained on the Day of Resurrection, and (the one whom he betrayed) will take as much of his good deeds as he wishes. So what do you think? (Reported by Muslim, 3515) Punishment for zina If the adulterer is married, the sin is greater, and the punishment is stoning, and if he is an old man, the sin is greater and the punishment is as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned in the hadeeth about the three whom Allah will neither look at nor praise on the Day of Resurrection, and who will have a painful punishment. (Saheeh Muslim, 156) If the deed is also committed during a sacred month or in a sacred place or at a time which is special in the sight of Allah, the sin is compounded. What constitutes zina? The jurists (may Allah have mercy on them) stated that the basic act of Zina which carries the punishment is illegal sexual intercourse, whereby the two circumcised parts [i.e. genitals] come together and there is penetration of the tip of the penis, because this is actual penetration (which carries the prescribed hadd or punishment). What leads to zina? A person must avoid evil deeds and everything that can lead to them. Allah has commanded us to avoid the traps of the Shaytaan, because if a man takes one step in that direction, his shaytan and his own ego (nafs) will keep urging him to do evil until he commits immoral deeds. One should think about how serious it is to touch a woman to whom one is not related, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained: If one of you were to be stabbed in the head with a piece of iron it would be better for him than if he were to touch a woman whom it is not permissible for him to touch. (Reported by al-Tabaraani; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 5045). This refers to the punishment for touching, so how about worse deeds, such as embracing and kissing, and even worse kinds of illicit activity? The Muslim judge is empowered to stipulate an appropriate punishment for every proven action other than actual intercourse; in the case of intercourse, the punishment set out by Islam is one hundred lashes and a year’s exile for one who is unmarried, and stoning for one who is married. This is the punishment in this world, and the punishment in the Hereafter is far more severe. Will adulterers be forgiven? One of the important principles which the salaf (may Allah have mercy on them) pointed out is that the sincere believer who truly hopes for Allaah and the Hereafter should not look at whether the sin is major or minor, or whether is carries a punishment (hadd) or not. Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: There is no major sin if one asks for forgiveness, and there is no minor sin if one persists in repeating it. Someone else said: If you want to disobey Allah, do not think about the smallness of the sin, think about the greatness of the One Whom you are disobeying. How can you seek repentance from zina? With regard to the matter of repentance from Zina , please refer to the book \"I Want to Repent, But...\" May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad. For more about zina-realted issues, see these answers: 6926 , 649 , 5445 , and 2487 And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Doing good is a habit and doing evil is a habit. Man is always either making progress or falling behind. When a person gets used to doing something, he becomes very fond of it and loves it, and dislikes anything else. Then he thinks that the thing he is not used to is not possible, but this way of thinking is not right and it goes against both the laws of Islam and the facts of reality. Therefore the one who uses his left hand to eat and drink should be taught the Islamic ruling and should be reminded of the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on this matter. When a man ate with his left hand in his presence, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Eat with your right hand. He said, I cannot. He said, May you never be able to! Nothing was stopping him but his stubborn arrogance, and he never raised his right hand to his mouth after that. (Reported by Muslim, 3776). According to a report narrated by al-Daarimi, his right hand never reached his mouth. This man suffered paralysis because of the duaa of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: In this hadeeth we have an indication that it is allowed to pray against a person who breaks a shari rule with no excuse. We also see the principle of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil in all situations, even with regard to eating. It encourages us to teach proper manners of eating to a person who is eating if he is doing something wrong. The hadeeth also teaches us that the Shaytaan eats with his left hand, because of the hadeeth: When any one of you eats, let him eat with his right hand, and when he drinks, let him drink with his right hand, because the Shaytaan eats with his left hand and drinks with his left hand. (Reported by Muslim, 3764). The Shaytaan eats with his left hand so the person who eats with his left hand resembles the Shaytaan, indeed the Shaytaan is sharing his food with him. Ahmad reported with a hasan isnaad from Aaishah and attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Whoever eats with his left hand, the Shaytaan eats with him. (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, commentary on hadeeth 1721). Moreover, the left hand should be reserved for removing dirt, as when cleaning oneself after going to the toilet (istinja) and blowing ones nose and other kinds of cleaning oneself and removing dirt. How can a person use that which is used for removing dirt and impurities for putting food in his mouth? Hafsah (may Allaah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to use his right hand for eating, drinking and getting dressed and his left hand for everything else. (Reported by Abu Dawood, no. 30) Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This is a fixed rule in shareeah. It has to do with honourable things such as putting on ones shirt, trousers and shoes, entering the mosque, using siwaak, applying kohl, combing and styling ones hair, shaving the head, giving salaam at the end of prayer, washing oneself in ghusl or wudoo, leaving the toilet, eating, drinking, shaking hands, acknowledging the Black Stone, and other things where we are encouraged to use the right hand or start with the right. As for the opposite [things that are not honourable], such as entering the toilet, leaving the mosque, blowing ones nose, washing oneself after using the toilet, taking off one's shirt, trousers and shoes, and so on, then we should start with the left or use the left hand. All of this has to do with honouring the right hand or right side. Some people may have a real problem that prevents them from using their right hand, such as being paralyzed and so on. In this case they are excused and there is no blame on them. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: If he has an excuse for not eating and drinking with his right hand, such as sickness or an injury, then this is not makrooh Most likely the problem of the boy you are asking about has to do with habit, so try to get him used to eating with his right hand and keep on advising him and reminding him to do so. You could seek the help of psychiatrists, because some of them may have some useful ideas. We ask Allaah to give you strength, May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

Your feelings of unease about taking this step may be due to the difficulty of leaving behind what you are used to and the religion that you have grown up in, or reluctance to go against your family and relatives, or fear of hostility and criticism from others, or concern about losing some worldly advantages. But all these issues will be easily overcome when you seek the help of Allaah and are determined to follow the truth. The wise person is prepared to make sacrifices and put up with difficulties for the sake of following the truth, because the truth is worth pursuing. Any difficulties encountered will become easy because the result is happiness in this world and the next, and Paradise the width of heaven and earth. Moreover, your marriage will help you to live in love and harmony with your husband (if he repents to Allaah for the forbidden relationship and becomes a religious person of good morals) and his Muslim family. There will be no dispute as to which religion the children will be raised in, and they will not feel that there is any conflict in the family, so they will be able to grow up free of the psychological complexes that result from the parents difference of religion. Other people have felt something similar to the feelings that you are experiencing now, as is reflected in the following story, which happened at the time of the Prophet of Islam (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Anas reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a man, Become Muslim. He said, I feel that I dont want to. He said, Become Muslim, even if you feel that you dont really want to. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 11618; Saheeh al-Jaami, 974). This is the correct approach which people should have towards the true religion. For more information on the topic of marriage, please see Questions #3025 and #2527. We wish you every good thing and success. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah.Firstly, we would like to thank you for your question. Secondly, before we discuss the matter of your right to the mahr or dowry, we should discuss the matter of marriage itself. A Muslim man is permitted to marry a chaste woman from the People of the Book (see Question #689 and #2527), and she is judged according to her situation at the time of marriage: has she given up her former promiscuous, immoral ways or not? If she is chaste and pure, it is permissible for him to enter into a marriage contract with her, and in this case, the dowry is her undeniable right. In order to resolve the problem once and for all, we advise you to enter Islam, because Islam cancels out all previous sins and wrong deeds, so save yourself from the Fire of Hell and earn happiness in this world and the next. Once you have become Muslim there will be no element of doubt whatsoever concerning the validity of your marriage, and the problem to which you refer in your question will no longer be an issue at all. We ask Allaah to guide you and us, and to give you help and success. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.No doubt the cause of this problem and others is ignorance of many of the rulings of Islam, and a lack of understanding of a man’s responsibilities towards those whom he is supporting, and the duties towards his family that Allaah has enjoined upon him. One of the greatest rights enjoined by wives in children is that the head of the family should spend on them; indeed, this is one of the greatest acts of worship and devotion to Allaah that a person can do. Spending on them covers their food, drink, clothing and shelter, and everything that a wife and children need to ensure their good health and physical well being. Allaah has told us that men are the ones who spend on women, and so they have the status of being qawwaamoon (maintainers and protectors) and of excelling over them, because they spend on them when they give them the mahr (dowry) and maintenance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means…”[al-Nisa’ 4:34] The fact that this spending is obligatory is indicated by the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars and of all wise people. The evidence of the Qur’aan includes the aayat (interpretation of the meanings): “Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allaah has given him. Allaah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allaah will grant after hardship, ease.”[al-Talaaq 65:7] “… but the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mother’s food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear…”[al-Baqarah 2:233] “… and if they are pregnant, spend on them until they deliver…” [al-Talaaq 65:6] With regard to the evidence in the Sunnah, many ahaadeeth were narrated which show that it is obligatory for the husband to spend on his wife and children, and those who are under his guardianship. Jaabir ibn ‘Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in his sermon during his Farewell Pilgrimage: “Fear Allaah with regard to women, for they are your prisoners. You have taken them as a trust from Allaah, and they are permissible for you through the word of Allaah, and they have the right to be given provision and clothing by you on a reasonable basis.” (Reported by Muslim, 8/183). ‘Umar ibn al-Ahwas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say during his Farewell Pilgrimage: “Verily, you have rights over your women, and your women have rights over you. As for your rights over your women, they are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, or allow anyone into your houses whom you dislike. Verily, their rights over you are that you should treat them well with regard to their clothing and food.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1163, and Ibn Maajah, 1851). Mu’aawiyah ibn Haydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, what are the rights of the wife of any one of us over us?’ He said, ‘That you feed her when you feed yourself and clothe her when you clothe yourself, that you do not say to her, “May Allaah make your face ugly!”, and that you do not hit her.’” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 2/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4/446). Imaam al-Baghawi said: “Al-Khattaabi said: this is a command to spend on women and clothe them, according to the capabilities of the husband. As the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made this a right of women, it is necessary whether the husband is present or absent. If the husband is not able to do it, it become a debt which he owes, as with all other duties, whether or not the qaadi (judge) issues a decree to that effect.” It was reported that Wahb said: “A freed slave of ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said to him, ‘I want to go and spend this month there in Jerusalem.’ He said, ‘Have you left enough for your family to live on during this month?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Then go back to your family and leave them what they need, for I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying: “It is enough sin for a man not to give food to the one whom he is supposed to feed.”’” (Reported by Ahmad, 2/160; Abu Dawood, 1692). The original report in is Muslim, where the wording is, “It is enough sin for a man to withhold food from the one whom he is supposed to feed.” Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah will ask everyone who has been given responsibility about whatever he was responsible for, until He asks a man about his family.” (Reported by Ibn Hibaan). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying, ‘By Allaah, if one of you were to get up in the morning and carry firewood on his back, and sell it and meet his own needs from the money and give some away in charity, this would be better for him than coming to a man and begging from him, and either being given something or not. The upper hand (the one which gives) is better than the lower hand (the one that takes), and start with those for whom you are responsible.” (Reported by Muslim, 3/96). According to a report narrated by Ahmad (2/524), it was said: “For whom am I responsible, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Your wife is one of those for whom you are responsible.” According to a hadeeth narrated by Jaabir ibn Samurah (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If Allaah gives something good to any one of you, let him start with himself and his family.” (Reported by Muslim, 1454). With regard to the consensus of the scholars: Imaam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/564): “The scholars are agreed that it is the duty of husbands to spend on their wives if they (the husbands) have reached the age of puberty, except in the case of a wife who is rebellious. This was mentioned by Ibn al-Mundhir and others.” The above references to the texts of Islam indicate that it is obligatory for a man to spend on his family and to take care of their interests. Many hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) demonstrate the virtue of this action and show that it is a righteous action in the sight of Allaah. Abu Mas’ood al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When the Muslim spends on his family with the hope of earning reward, this is an act of charity for him.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1/136). Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fath (9/498): “Spending on one's family is obligatory according to scholarly consensus. Islam called it sadaqah (charity) lest people think that they are doing it as a duty for which there is no reward, because they knew how much reward there is in giving charity, so that they will not give charity to others until they have given enough to their families. This was to encourage them to give priority to the charity that is obligatory before they give voluntary charity.” Sa’d ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: “Whatever you spend on your family, you will be rewarded for it, even the mouthful which you lift up and place in your wife’s mouth.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3/164, and Muslim, 1628). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “A dinar that you spend in the way of Allaah, a dinar that you spend to free a slave, a dinar that you give to the poor, and a dinar that you spend on your family – the greatest of these is the one that you spend on your family. “ (reported by Muslim, 2/692). Ka’b ibn ‘Ujarah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “A man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and his Companions were impressed by the man's strength and energy. They said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, if only this was for the sake of Allaah!’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If he goes out to work for the sake of his young children, he is striving for the sake of Allaah; if he goes out to work for the sake of his aged parents, he is striving for the sake of Allaah; if he goes out to work to keep himself from having to beg, he is striving for the sake of Allaah; but if he goes out to work for the purposes of showing off and boasting, then he is striving in the way of the Shaytaan.” (Reported by al-Tabaraani, Saheeh al-Jaami’, 2/8). The salaf, may Allaah have mercy on them, understood this duty properly. It was their guideline in their day-to-day life with their families. No one put it better than Imaam al-Rabaani ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allaah have mercy on him), who said: “There is nothing better than earning one's own living, not even jihaad for the sake of Allaah.” (al-Siyar, 8/399) It is not permissible for a Muslim to neglect his family even if he claims that he is travelling for the purpose of worship and righteous deeds, because neglecting one’s family and failing to spend on them is haraam. We have quoted above the advice given by ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr to the one who wanted to stay in Jerusalem: he had to make arrangements for his family’s provision first. So you have to advise your father of the things we have said in this reply, and explain the matter to him politely and kindly. If you can fill the gap left by your father’s negligence by spending some of your own money on your family as much as you can, you will get a great reward, in sha Allaah. We ask Allaah to put all our affairs right. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah has commanded us to treat our parents well, and He has linked this to the command to worship Him and the prohibition of associating anything in worship with Him. The rights of the mother in this regard have been emphasized more than those of the father. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Worship none but Allaah (Alone) and be dutiful and good to parents [al-Baqarah 2:83]. Ibn Abbaas said: This means treating them with respect and kindness, and lowering the wing of humility to them, not answering them harshly or glaring at them, not raising one's voice to them, but being as humble towards them as a slave towards his master. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be dutiful to your parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of disrespect, not shout at them, but address them in terms of honour. And lower unto them the wing of submission and humility through mercy, and say: My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was small. [al-Isra 17:23-24]. Al-Baghawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This means not saying anything that may contain the slightest hint of irritation. [The word uff in the aayah, translated here as a word of disrepect] comes from the word aff, which is similar to the word taff; both words refer to the dirt that collects under fingernails, and [in Arabic] when one is annoyed and fed up with something, one says uff! to it. Abu Baddaah al-Tajeebi said: I said to Saeed ibn al-Musayyab: I understood everything in the Quraan about respecting ones parents, apart from the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) But address them in terms of honour [al-Isra 17:23]. What are these terms of honour [al-qawl al-kareem]? Ibn al-Musayyab said: It is the way in which a slave who has done wrong approaches a harsh and strict master. The obligation of treating ones parents with kindness and respect is not confined only to Muslim parents; they should be honoured in this way even if they are kaafirs. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years give thanks to Me and to your parents, - unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do. [Luqmaan 31:14-15]. If Allaah has told us to treat even these parents with respect and kindness, in spite of the heinous sin which they are telling their child to commit, which is the crime of associating something in worship with Allaah, then what do you think is the case with Muslim parents, especially if they are righteous? By Allaah, their rights are among the most important and most certain rights, and fulfilling these rights in a proper manner is one of the most difficult and most important duties. The one who is guided to do this is truly guided, and the one who is not helped to do this is truly deprived. Innumerable ahaadeeth also confirm this. According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him): A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allaah, who among the people is most deserving of my good companionship? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then whom? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then whom? He said, Your mother. He asked, Then whom? He said, Then your father. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4/13, and Muslim, 2548). Makhool said: Respecting ones parents is an expiation for major sins. You have to be patient with your mother and put up with the harsh treatment on her part, which is upsetting you. By treating her with respect and dealing with her kindly, you will earn her good pleasure and love. Try to avoid things that will provoke her and make her angry, even if they are in your interests, without causing harm to yourself. Your mother, for her part, has to treat you well and stop harming you with her blows and insults. With regard to what you mention about her praying against you, if these duaas are said for no good reason, they will not be accepted. It is not permissible for her to pray against you for no good reason, because of the general applicability of the Prophets words: [The prayers] of any of you will be answered, so long as he does not pray for sin or the breaking of family ties. This hadeeth indicates that if a duaa includes sin, it will definitely not be answered. There is no doubt that praying against ones child for no good reason is a sin. We ask Allaah to help you to treat her with respect and earn her pleasure, and to help us all to do that which He loves and will please Him. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.One of the most important rights that a wife has is that her husband should spend on her, and his spending on her is one of the greatest good deeds that he can do that will bring him closer to Allaah. This spending covers food, drink, clothing and housing, and all the other things that a wife needs for her sustenance and good health. With regard to what you mention of your wifes complaints that you are not spending enough on her, Allaah tells us that men are the ones who should spend on women, and they have been given the position of qawwaamah (protector and maintainer) and excellence because of the money they spend on them in the mahr and on their maintenance. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means [al-Nisa 4:34]. The Quraan, Sunnah and consensus of the scholars (ijmaa) all indicate that this spending is obligatory. The Quraan tells us (interpretation of the meanings): the father of the child shall bear the cost of the mothers food and clothing on a reasonable basis. No person shall have a burden laid on him greater than he can bear [al-Baqarah 2:233] And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they deliver [al-Talaaq 65:6] With regard to the evidence of the Sunnah, many ahaadeeth have been narrated which indicate that it is obligatory for a husband to spend on his wife and children and those under his guardianship, as was proven in the hadeeth of Jaabir ibn Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in his Farewell Sermon: Fear Allaah with regard to women, for they are your prisoners. You have taken them as a trust from Allaah, and they have become permissible to you by the word of Allaah, and they have the right to be fed and clothed reasonably by you. (Reported by Muslim, 8/183). Umar ibn al-Ahwas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that he heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say during the Farewell Pilgrimage: Take good care of women, for they are your prisoners and you have no rights over them beyond that, except if they commit open illegal lewdness; if they do that, then you should shun them in their beds and strike them, but not in a way that causes pain. And if they return to obedience, seek not against them means (of annoyance). You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they should not allow anyone to sit on your beds whom you dislike, or allow anyone to enter your houses who you dislike, and their rights over you are that you should clothe and feed them properly. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1163; Ibn Maajah, 1851. Al-Tirmidhi said this is a hasan saheeh hadeeth). Muaawiyah ibn Haydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I said, O Messenger of Allaah, what is the right of the wife of any one of us over us? He said: That you should feed her as you feed yourself and clothe her as you clothe yourself, that you should not say to her May Allaah make your face ugly! and that you should not beat her. (Reported by Abu Dawood, 2/244; Ibn Maajah, 1850; Ahmad, 4/446). Imaam al-Baghawi said: Al-Khattaabi said: This means that it is obligatory to spend on her and clothe her, according to the means of the husband. Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made it a right of the wife, it is obligatory on the husband whether he is present or absent. If he is not able to do this at any particular time, it becomes a debt that he owes, as in the case of other duties, whether or not the qaadi (judge) imposes it on him for the time when he is absent. Wahb said: A freed slave of Abd-Allaah ibn Amr said to him: I want to spend this month here in Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). He said, Have you left your family anything for their provisions during this month? He said, No. He said, Then go back to your family and leave them something for their provisions, for I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying, It is enough sin for a man to neglect those he is responsible to feed. (Reported by Ahmad, 2/160; Abu Dawood, 1692) The original hadeeth is reported by Muslim (245), with the wording: It is enough sin for a man to keep food away from those he is responsible to feed. Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah will ask every responsible person (literally, shepherd) about those for whom he was responsible, whether he took care of them or not, and He will even ask a man about the members of his household. (Reported by Ibn Hibbaan and classed as hasan in Saheeh al-Jaami, 1774). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: By Allaah, if one of you were to go out in the morning and gather firewood on his back, and sell it and make himself independent, and give some of it in charity, this is better for him than his coming to a man and asking for anything, whether he gives or refuses. The upper hand is better than the lower hand, and start with those who are under your care. (Reported by Muslim, 3/96). According to a report narrated by Ahmad (2/524): It was said, Who are those who are under our care, O Messenger of Allaah? He said, Your wife is one of those who are under your care. With regard to the consensus of the scholars (ijmaa): Imaam Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (7/564): The scholars are agreed that it is obligatory on men to spend on their wives, except in the case of a wife who is rebellious. This was mentioned by Ibn al-Mundhir and others. The texts referred to above indicate that it is obligatory for a man to spend on his household and to take care of them and their best interests. Numerous ahaadeeth reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) describe the virtue of this and state that it is a righteous deed in the sight of Allaah, for example the hadeeth of Abu Masood al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If a Muslim spends on his wife, and hopes for reward from Allaah, it will be counted as sadaqah (charity) on his part. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1/136). Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fath (9/498): Spending on ones wife is obligatory according to consensus (ijmaa), and Islam described it as charity lest people think that it is only a duty for which they will not be rewarded, for they already know the rewards for charity. Islam taught them that it will be counted as charity so that they will not give to others besides their wives until they (the wives) have enough, to encourage them to give obligatory charity before they give voluntary charity. Sad ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him: No matter what you spend on your family, you will be rewarded, even for the morsel of food you put in your wifes mouth. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3/164, and Muslim, 1628). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A dinar spent for the sake of Allaah, a dinar spent to free a slave, a dinar given in charity to a poor person, and a dinar spent on ones wife the greatest in reward of all these is the dinar spent on one's wife. (Reported by Muslim, 2/692) Kab ibn Ijrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: A man passed by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and his Companions were impressed with how strong and energetic he appeared. They said, O Messenger of Allaah, if only this was for the sake of Allaah! The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If he is going out to earn a living for his young children, this is for the sake of Allaah; if he is going out to earn a living for his aged parents, this is for the sake of Allaah; if he is going out to earn a living so he can keep himself from begging from others, this is for the sake of Allaah; but if he is going out to boast and show off, then this is for the sake of Shaytaan. (Reported by al-Tabaraani, Saheeh al-Jaami, 2/8) The salaf (may Allaah have mercy on them) understood this duty properly, and said words to that effect. How marvellous are the words of the great imaam Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak (may Allaah have mercy on him): There is nothing equivalent in reward to earning money to spend on your family, not even jihaad for the sake of Allaah. (Al-Siyar, 8/399). At the same time, your wife should understand that the husbands obligation to spend should be within his means and according to his financial situation, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allaah has given him. Allaah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allaah will grant after hardship, ease. [al-Talaaq 65:7] She has no right to mistreat her husband by asking him for too much and expecting him to exhaust himself in spending on her; that is bad treatment indeed. Perhaps if you grant her some of her reasonable requests and remind her, gently and tactfully, of the requests that you have fulfilled, you may be able to lessen her anger somewhat and persuade her to stop asking for more. You could also discuss with her, quietly and without resorting to arguing, how important her requests really are and how necessary it is to keep a certain amount for things that are more important, like paying the rent and so on. This may also persuade her to stop asking. Know that what you lack in financial resources can be compensated for with kind words and promises for when things get better. When Allaah mentioned taking care of ones relatives and upholding family ties, He also mentioned what a person can do who does not have money to give to his relatives. He says (interpretation of the meaning): And if you turn away from them (relatives, the poor etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but you have no money at the time they ask for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope, then speak unto them a kind, soft word (i.e., Allaah will give me and I shall give you). [al-Isra 18:28] Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his interpretation of this aayah: And if you turn away from them (relatives, the poor etc. whom We have ordered you to give their rights, but you have no money at the time they ask for it) and you are awaiting a mercy from your Lord for which you hope means: if your relatives ask you for something that We have commanded you to give them, and you do not have anything, and you turn away from them because you have nothing to spend on them, then speak unto them a kind, soft word which means, promise them, gently and kindly, that when the provision of Allaah comes, we will give it to you, in sha Allaah. Know that a good attitude will make her forget the hardship you are going through. You have to be patient and treat her kindly, whilst repeating your advice. If life becomes too difficult and the situation between you deteriorates to such an extent that you reach a total impasse, if your efforts do not succeed and life becomes unbearable, then Allaah has permitted divorce in such cases, and this may indeed be better for both parties, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): But if they separate (by divorce), Allaah will provide abundance for everyone of them from His Bounty. And Allaah is Ever All-Sufficient for His creatures need, All-Wise. [al-Nisa 4:130]\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This is a matter concerning which rulings may differ according to different circumstances in different times and places. There is no absolute ruling that covers all situations, both real and hypothetical. In some cases it is wrong to vote, such as when the matter will have no effect on the Muslims, or when the Muslims have no effect on the outcome of the vote. In this case voting or not voting is all the same. The same applies in cases where all the candidates are equally evil or where they all have the same attitude towards Muslims… It may be the case that the interests of Islam require Muslims to vote so as to ward off the greater evil and to reduce harmful effects, such as where two candidates may be non-Muslims but one of them is less hostile towards Muslims than the other, and Muslims’ votes will have an impact on the outcome of the election. In such cases there is nothing wrong with Muslims casting their votes in favour of the less evil candidate. In any case, this is the matter of ijtihaad based on the principle of weighing up the pros and cons, what is in the interests of Islam and what is detrimental. With regard to this matter, we have to refer to the people of knowledge who understand this principle. We should put the question to them, explaining in detail the circumstances and laws in the country where the Muslim community is living, the state of the candidates, the importance of the vote, the likely benefits, and so on. No one should imagine that anyone who says that it is OK to vote is thereby expressing approval or support for kufr. It is done in the interests of the Muslims, not out of love for kufr and its people. The Muslims rejoiced when the Romans defeated the Persians, as did the Muslims in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) when the Negus defeated those who had challenged his authority. This is well known from history. Whoever wants to be on the safe side and abstain from voting is allowed to do so. This response applies only to elections for influential positions. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Some saheeh reports from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) describe duaas that can be recited one hundred times during the day and night, such as that reported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Whoever says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa ala kulli shayin Qadeer (There is no god but Allaah Alone, with no partner or associate; His is the Dominion and His is the Praise, and He is Able to do all things), one hundred times in a day, it will be equivalent (in reward) to freeing ten slaves, and a hundred hasanaat (good deeds) will be recorded for him, and one hundred sayiaat (bad deeds) will be erased from his record; it will be a protection for him from the Shaytaan all that day until evening comes, and nobody can do any better than that except one who does more than that. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3050). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever says Subhaan Allaah wa bi hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allaah) one hundred times in a day, his sins will be wiped out even if they are like the foam of the sea. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5936). With regard to trustworthy and reliable books of duaas and dhikr, this is a topic which has been covered in many books, ancient and modern, whether the books deal with this topic on its own or it is included with other material.

      "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: those who are responsible for requesting samples for quality-control testing must ask for the amount that is usually sufficient for testing, and not ask for or accept more than what is needed. Secondly: in cases where only some of the amount given is sufficient, whatever is left over must be handed back to its owner. His address should be written down on the sample, and an appointment should be made to give back whatever is left over from the tests. A name of a contact person and an address should also be obtained, so that the goods may be returned. Thirdly: in the event that the owner of the goods or his representative does not keep the appointment, and there is the fear that the samples may go off, then they may be sold and the money raised should be given to Bayt al-maal al-Muslimeen (the treasury of the Islamic state). If they cannot be sold, they should be given away to the people who are usually taken care of by the bayt al-maal.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them, agreed that covering the awrah is a condition of the validity of ones prayer. The evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying [al-Araaf 7:31] The conditions for clothes to cover the awrah properly are as follows: They should not show the shape or contours of the body; if they do so, this is no good because it does not cover properly. They should be clean (taahir). If the clothes are unclean or impure (naajis), then it is not correct to pray in them, because it is haraam to have any impurity (najaasah) on ones body or clothes when praying. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And your garments purify! [al-Muddaththir 74:4]. It was reported that a baby boy who was not yet eating solid food was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he sat the infant in his lap. The child urinated in his lap, and he called for water and poured it over the urine. The fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) hastened to wash the childs urine from his clothes indicates that it is obligatory to clean ones clothes of any impurity that may get on them. They should be permissible, not haraam, whether they are haraam in and of themselves, such as silk garments, or because of the way in which they are made, such as garments that come below the ankles, or because of the way in which they were acquired, such as garments seized by force or stolen. With regard to the matter of the awrah becoming uncovered during prayer, al-Shaafa'i, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: It is good enough for both men and women to pray with their awrah covered. The mans awrah is what I have already described (i.e., from the navel to theknee), and all of a woman is awrah, apart from her face and hands. The top of her feet is also awrah. If during prayer any part of the area between a mans navel and knees becomes uncovered, or any part of a womans hair, whether it is a lot or a little, or any part of her body apart from her face and hands and wrist and no more than that becomes uncovered, whether they realize it or not, then both (man and woman) must repeat the prayer unless it was uncovered by the wind, or it slipped and was immediately replaced without delay (no longer than it takes to pick up the garment and place it back immediately.) (Al-Shaafa'i, Kitaab al-Umm, Baab Kayfiyyat Libs al-Thiyaab fil-Salaah). Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni: Section: if a little bit of the awrah becomes uncovered, this does not invalidate the prayer. This is the opinion of Ahmad and Abu Haneefah. Al-Shaafa'i said: It invalidates the prayer because it is a ruling that has to do with the awrah, and it is the same whether it is a little or a lot, as is the case with looking (at the awrah). We have what was reported by Abu Dawood, with his isnaad from Ayyoob, from Amr ibn Salamah al-Jarmi, who said: My father went with a group from his people to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he taught them how to pray. He said, The one who reads Quraan best among you should lead you in prayer. I was the best at reading Quraan, so they appointed me. I used to lead them in prayer wearing a small yellow burdah (cloak or garment), and when I prostrated, my awrah became uncovered. One of the women said, Cover the awrah of your reciter for us! so they bought me an Omani shirt, and I never rejoiced over anything apart from Islam as much as I rejoiced over that. Reported by Abu Dawood. Al-Nasaa'i also reported from Aasim al-Ahwal, from Amr ibn Salamah, who said: I used to lead them in prayer wearing a burdah made of two attached parts in which there was a gap. When I prostrated in it, my backside showed. This was common and was not denounced, and we have not heard that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any of his Companions denounced it, because if prayer is still valid despite a severe problem where there is an excuse, then we should differentiate between whether the problem is severe or not where there is no excuse; it is like the case of walking during the prayer. Avoiding little matters may be too difficult, so a little is excused, as is the case with blood. Once this is clear, the definition of a lot is that which is offensive to look at, and in this case there is no differentiation between the private parts and other parts of the awrah. A little is that which is not offensive, and the point of reference is that which is customary, except that the two private parts are more offensive than anything else, so that is considered to be an obstacle to prayer This is a matter in which Islam did not define what is offensive, so the point of reference is what is customary, as also applies in the case of excessive movement during the prayer If these holes show what is customarily regarded to be too much of the awrah, and it shows it for a while, or it is not possible to cover them because the garment is too small, for example, then the prayer is not valid, because covering the awrah is one of the conditions of prayer, and if one of the conditions is not met without a valid excuse such as inability to meet it, then the prayer is not valid. You have to repeat the prayers which you did wearing this garment. If you do not know how many they were, you should take what you are certain of. For example, if you think that they may have been four or three or five, but definitely not more than five, then what you can be certain of in this case is five, and so on. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If the situation is as you describe, then what can we say about the immense disaster of a father who does not pray or fast, who drinks intoxicants and commits immoral acts, who neglects his family and calls them to do evil deeds? Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah; hasbunaa Allaah wa niam al-wakeel; innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raajioon (There is no strength and no power except with Allaah; sufficient unto us is Allaah and He is the best Disposer of affairs; verily we belong to Allaah and unto Him we will return). [These are duaas recited by Muslims when faced with calamity Translator] Does he not know that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allaah, but do that which they are commanded.[al-Tahreem 66:6] Does he not know that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no person to whom Allaah has given responsibility and dies neglecting that responsibility, but Allaah will deny him Paradise. (Reported by Muslim, 203) Every one of you is a shepherd and every one of you is responsible for his flock (those under his care) a man is the shepherd over the members of his household and he is responsible for them Allaah will ask every shepherd about that for which he was responsible. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1627). There is no person to whom Allaah has given responsibility over others and he failed to take care of them by advising them sincerely, but he will never smell the fragrance of Paradise. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6617). We ask Allaah to bring this man back to the truth. Know that even though your father has caused you so much suffering, it is not permissible for you to sever your ties with him, in spite of all that you have mentioned. You must keep in touch with him and treat him kindly. You and your siblings should treat him kindly and express your fears for him and your love for him, because of his rights as a father, and because severing ties with him and ignoring him in a hostile manner will only make matters worse. Neither you nor your siblings should obey him in sin. You mention in your message that your father used to treat you well when you gave him money, so if giving him money will put an end to his bad treatment and make things go back to normal, so that you will treat one another well and he will see love and sacrifice on your part, then why not do that? This is provided that he does not use this money to buy haraam things. Try to restrain your anger and forget his past shortcomings in his behaviour towards you. Try to honour him and show love towards him. Visit him and look after him. Maybe this will stir up true fatherly feelings in him, and maybe stop him from doing haraam things. Dont even think of severing ties with him. Get in touch with your brother and ask him to get back in touch with his father. Know that your being patient with him is a kind of jihaad, which will be rewarded. The idea of not visiting him until he repents is not right, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do. [Luqmaan 31:15] Visit him, so long as it does not cause you unbearable harm or make you do wrongful things. Know that one of the ways to make a sinner repent is having someone who will call him to repent and remind him of Allaah. A child has to treat his parents honourably even if they are mushrikeen. Al-Qurtubi said: The aayah indicates that one should honour kaafir parents as much as possible by spending on them if they are poor, by speaking kindly to them, and by calling them to Islam. With regard to your sister, she must be careful when she stays with her immoral father. Locking herself in is a good safety measure and may well be essential at times. If she does not feel safe in the home of this immoral father, she should go and live somewhere else where she can be safe, such as in your house, if it is suitable. Maybe Allaah will give her a righteous husband who will take care of her and protect her. We ask Allaah to guide your father and to bring him out of darkness into light. May He forgive you for your sin and help your sister and all of us to adhere steadfastly to the truth. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There are a number of ahaadeeth which indicate that the Qur’aan will be taken away at the end of time. Among these ahaadeeth are the following: From ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood, who said: “Something will come and take the Qur’aan one night and not one aayah will be left, either in the Mus-haf or in the heart of any person, but it will be taken away.” (Narrated by al-Daarimi with a saheeh isnaad, no. 3209) Al-Daarimi narrated with a different saheeh isnaad (no. 3207) that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: “Recite the Qur’aan much before it is taken away.” They said, “These Mus-hafs will be taken away! What about that which is (memorized) in men’s hearts?” He said: “Something will come and take it one night, and in the morning they will wake up without it. They will forget the phrase ‘laa ilaaha ill-Allaah’ and they will start to recite the sayings and poetry of the Jaahiliyyah. That is when the Word will be fulfilled against them.” The phrase ‘That is when the Word will be fulfilled against them’ is a reference to the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And when the Word (of torment) is fulfilled against them, We shall bring out from the earth a beast for them, to speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayaat (Verses of the Qur’aan and Prophet Muhammad)” [al-Naml 27:82]. Ibn Katheer said in his tafseer of this aayah: This beast will emerge at the end of time when mankind becomes so corrupt that they neglect the commandments of Allaah and change the true religion. Allaah will bring forth for them a beast from the earth – it was said from Makkah, or from elsewhere – and it will speak to the people concerning that. Ibn ‘Abbaas, al-Hasan and al-Qutaadah said – and it was also narrated from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib – (may Allaah be pleased with them all): it will speak to them, i.e., it will address them. ‘Ataa’ al-Khurasaani said – and it was narrated from ‘Ali and this was the view favourd by Ibn Jareer: it will speak to them and it will say to them, ‘mankind believed not with certainty in Our Ayaat’. There are some reservations about this interpretation, and Allaah knows best. According to one report, Ibn ‘Abbaas said: the words tukallimuhum (to speak to them) means, it will wound them; according to another report he said: it will do both (i.e., speak to them and wound them). [The word Tukallim may mean either speak or wound. – Translator]. This is a good point with no contradictions, and Allaah knows best. (Tafseer al-Qur’aan al-‘Azeem, 3/375-378) Many ahaadeeth and reports have been narrated about the beast, such as the following: It was reported that Hudhayfah ibn Usayd al-Ghiffaari said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw us from a room whilst we were talking about the Hour. He said: “The Hour will not come until you see ten signs: the rising of the sun from the west; the smoke; the beast; the emergence of Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj; the appearance of ‘Eesaa ibn Maryam (peace be upon him); the Dajjaal (“antichrist”); three landslides – one in the west, one in the east and one in the Arabian Peninsula; and fire which will emerge from the direction of ‘Aden and will drive – or gather – the people, stopping with them whenever they rest overnight or during the siesta hour.” (Narrated by Imaam Ahmed, no. 46 – his version is his; also by Muslim, no 2901; Abu Dawood, no. 4311; al-Tirmidhi, no. 2183 - he said it is hasan saheeh; al-Nasaa’i, no. 1138; Ibn Maajah, no. 4055). It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There are three things which, when they appear, it will not benefit anyone to believe if he did not believe before: the Dajjaal, the beast and the rising of the sun from the west – or from the place where it sets.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, no. 3072; he said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth). It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Hasten to do good deeds before six things come to pass: the rising of the sun from the place where it sets; the smoke; the Dajjaal; the beast; or personal calamities or general tribulations.” (narrated by Muslim, no. 2947; Ibn Maajah, no. 4056, and others). There are many ahaadeeth which speak of the beast which will emerge at the end of time, but it would take too long to quote them all here. And Allaah is the Source of strength. Further evidence that the Qur’aan will be taken away at the end of time is to be found in the report narrated by al-Tabaraani in al-Mu’jam al-Kabeer, no. 8698, according to which Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “This Qur’aan will most certainly be taken away from amongst you.” He was asked: “O Abu ‘Abd al-Rahmaan, how will it be taken away when it is so deeply rooted in our hearts and is written in our mus-hafs?” He said: “Something will come to it at night, then there will be nothing left of it in people’s hearts or in the mus-haf, and the next morning the people will be like animals.” Then he recited the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And if We willed, We could surely, take away that which We have revealed to you (i.e. this Qur’aan). Then you would find no protector for you against Us in that respect” [al-Israa’ 17:86]. Ibn Hajar said in Fath al-Baari (13/16): its isnaad is saheeh but it is mawqoof. Al-Haythami said in Majma’ al-Zawaa’id, 7/329): its men are the men of saheeh, apart from Shaddaad ibn Ma’qil, who is thiqah. And it was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. This hadeeth is to be regarded as marfoo’, because it deals with something which is not subject to opinion orijtihaad. Imaam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa (3/198): “At the end of time, something will come to it at night in the mus-hafs and in people’s hearts,then there will not be left one word of it in people’s hearts or one letter of it in the Mus-haf.” Allaah revealed the Qur’aan as a guidance to mankind and He guaranteed to protect it. It is the eternal miracle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and it will remain, and people of earlier and later generations will learn from it and be guided by it, but at the end of time, just before the Hour comes, Allaah will take the souls of the believers, and there will be no one left on earth except the most evil of people. There will be no prayer, no fasting, no Hajj and no charity (zakaah). Then there will be no point in the Ka’bah being there or in the Qur’aan remaining among mankind, so Allaah will decree that the Ka’bah be destroyed at the hands of a kaafir from Ethiopia.Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh, no. 1519 that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The Ka’bah will be destroyed by Dhu’l-Suwayqatayn from Ethiopia.” And Allaah will take the Qur’aan away from the earth, and not one aayah of it will be left in the mus-hafs or in people’s hearts. Allaah will not permit His Book to remain on earth if it is not benefitting anyone and no one is acting in accordance with it. So this thing will come to pass. This frightening event makes the sincere Muslim hasten to pay attention to the Book of Allaah, to learn it, memorize it, recite it and ponder its meanings, before the Book is taken away. This is one of the tribulations that will happen at the end of time, concerning which our Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Hasten to do good deeds before tribulations come like patches of dark night, when a man will wake up as a believer and by evening he will be a kaafir, or in the evening he will be a believer and by morning he will be a kaafir, selling his religion for some worldly gains.” (narrated by Muslim, no. 169). We ask Allaah to make us adhere firmly to His religion and to protect us from tribulations, both seen and unseen.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. The scholars, past and present, differed concerning this issue. Some of them said that it is permissible for a woman to travel for Hajj without a mahram if the road is safe and she is with a trustworthy group. Some of them said that it is not permissible for her to travel except with a mahram who can protect her, even if she is with a trustworthy group. This is the view of Abu Haneefah and Ahmad. They quoted the following as evidence: 1 – It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No woman should travel except with a mahram, and no man should enter upon a woman unless there is a mahram with her.” A man said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I want to go out with such and such an army, and my wife wants to go for Hajj.” He said: “Go for Hajj with her.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1763) and Muslim (1341). 2 – It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to travel for the distance of one day and one night except with her mahram.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (1038) and Muslim (133). According to al-Bukhaari (1139) and Muslim (827), from the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed: “The distance of two days.” Ibn Hajar said: In the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed it is limited to “the distance of two days” and in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah it is limited to “the distance of one day and one night.” There are also other reports. In the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar it is limited to “three days” and there are other reports too. Al-Nawawi said: The apparent meaning of this definition is not what is meant, rather everything that is regarded as travel is forbidden to a woman unless she has a mahram with her. The definition of the limits was in reference to specific incidents. Ibn al-Muneer said: The differences in the definitions arose because there was different questioners in different situations. End quote. Fath al-Baari (4/75). Secondly: Those who say that a mahram is not required quoted the following as evidence: 1 – It was narrated that ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Whilst I was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), a man came to him and complained of poverty. Then another came and complained about banditry. He said: “O ‘Adiyy have you seen al-al-Heerah?” I said: “I have not seen it, but I have been told about it.” He said: “If you live a long life, you will see a woman travelling from al-Heerah until she circumambulates the Ka’bah, fearing no one but Allaah.” … ‘Adiyy said: And I saw a woman travelling from al-Heerah until she circumambulated the Ka’bah, fearing no one but Allaah. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3400). This argument may be countered by noting that this was simply the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) foretelling this incident. Speaking of an incident does not mean that it is permissible. Rather it may be permissible or not, depending on the shar’i evidence. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also foretold that drinking alcohol, zina and a great deal of killing would become widespread before the Hour begins, and these are things that are forbidden and are major sins. What is meant by the hadeeth is that security would become widespread, so that women would feel emboldened and one of them would travel without a mahram. It does not mean that it is permissible for a woman to travel without a mahram. Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Not everything that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) foretold as signs of the Hour is haraam or forbidden. If the shepherds compete in erecting tall buildings, and wealth becomes widespread, and there is one man to look after fifty women, these things are undoubtedly not haraam. Rather these are signs, and a sign has nothing to do with whether it is halaal or haraam. Rather a sign may be good or bad, permissible or haraam or obligatory or anything else. And Allaah knows best. End quote. It should be noted that the difference of scholarly opinion regarding the necessity of having a mahram in order to perform Hajj applies to the obligatory Hajj only. As for naafil (supererogatory) Hajj, the scholars are all agreed that it is not permissible for a woman to travel except with a mahram or husband, as it says in al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah (17/36). The scholars of the Standing Committee said: A woman who does not have a mahram is not obliged to perform Hajj, because having a mahram is part of being able for it, and being able for it is one of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence)” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97] It is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj or anything else unless she has her husband or mahram with her. This is the view of al-Hasan, al-Nakha’i, Ahmad, Ishaaq, Ibn al-Mundhir and Ashaab al-Ra’y, and this is the correct view, because of the verse quoted above as well as the general meaning of the ahaadeeth which forbid a woman to travel without her husband or mahram. Maalik, al-Shaafa’i and al-Awzaa’i disagreed with that and they stipulated conditions for which they do not have any proof. Ibn al-Mundhir said: They ignored the apparent meaning of the hadeeth, and each of them stipulated conditions for which they did not have any proof. End quote. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (11/90, 91). They also said: The correct view is that it is not permissible for her to travel for Hajj except with her husband or her mahram. It is not permissible for her to travel with trustworthy women without a mahram, or with her paternal aunt, maternal aunt or mother. Rather it is essential that she be with her husband or a mahram. If she cannot find someone to accompany her, then she is not obliged to do Hajj so long as that is the case. End quote from Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah (11/92). And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The mutawaatir reports of the Sunnah show that making pictures or images is absolutely haraam and those who make pictures are cursed. Every maker of pictures will be in Hell, and every picture or image that he made will be given a soul and he will be punished by it in Hell. The makers of pictures will be the most severely punished of people. The picture-maker will be told to breathe life into the images he made; they will be punished and will be told, “Give life to that which you have created!” The prohibition is multiplied if these pictures cause temptation, such as pictures of naked women, or pictures of men with women. If that is haraam, then how about the magazines that promote this and call people to temptation, immorality, promiscuity and the means of doing wrong? Anyone who publishes such magazines, or sells them, gives them as a gift or buys them, partakes in the sin. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed wine and the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the one who makes it, the one for whom it is made, the one who drinks it, the one who serves it, the one who carries it, the one to whom it is carried, and the one who profits from it. The same applies to these magazines, whose bad effect on people’s morals, chastity and religion is sometimes worse than that of alcohol, especially when they contain deviant ideas and news of female performers and women who adorn themselves in the manner of jaahiliyyah. Publishing these magazines, writing articles for them, importing them and publicizing them means that one is taking part in this corruption, spreading immorality and calling for promiscuity, social disintegration and deviation from correct morals and modesty. Our advice to anyone who wants to attain salvation is to keep away from these magazines and have nothing to do with them in the slightest, in the hope of saving oneself and keeping one’s religion and honour safe. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to publish magazines that contain pictures of women or that propagate zinaa (unlawful sexual activity), immorality, homosexuality, drinking alcohol or other forms of falsehood. It is not permissible to work as an editor, writer or distributor for such magazines, because this involves co-operating in sin, spreading mischief throughout the land, calling for the corruption of society and propagating promiscuity. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… help one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allaah. Verily Allaah is Severe in punishment.” [al-Maa’idah 5:2]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever calls to right guidance will have a reward equal to that of the one who follows it, without it detracting in the least from his reward; and whoever calls to misguidance will bear sin equal to that of the one who follows it, without it detracting in the least from his sin.” (Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh, 4831). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “There are two types of the people of Hell whom I have not seen: people with whips like the tails of cattle, with which they beat the people, and women who are clothed yet naked, walking with an enticing gait and with their heads looking like the humps of camels leaning to one side. They will not enter Paradise or even smell its fragrance, although its fragrance can be detected from such-and-such a distance.” (Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh, 3971). There are many aayaat and ahaadeeth on this topic. We ask Allaah to help the Muslims to do what is good for them.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This is a kind of service, but it is satanic service which the Shaytaan is instilling in the person who does this and makes it appear that someone is present when this is not the case. There are three reasons for having reservations about this practice: (1) It is lying; (2) it involves deceiving those who are in charge; (3) it makes the absent person entitled to wages on the basis of attendance, which he then takes and consumes unlawfully. One of these reservations alone is sufficient to make this practice, which the questioner apparently sees as a human service or favour, be described as haraam. Not all human favours are praiseworthy; only those that coincide with sharee’ah are praiseworthy – those that go against sharee’ah are to be condemned. Calling favours that go against sharee’ah “human services” is in fact a misnomer, because anything that goes against sharee’ah is a bestial action. This is why Allaah described the kuffaar and mushrikeen as being like cattle. He says (interpretation of the meaning): “… while those who disbelieve enjoy themselves and eat as cattle eat, and the Fire will be their abode.” [Muhammad 47:12] and “…They are only like cattle; - nay, they are even farther astray from the Path…” [al-Furqaan 25:44]. So everything that is contrary to sharee’ah is a bestial action, not human.\n",

      "Contents Related Minimum amount of mahr in Islam Mahr of the Mothers of the Believers Praise be to Allah.Minimum amount of mahr in Islam The minimum amount of mahr has been explained in the report in al-Sahih (no. 1425) narrated from Sahl ibn Sa’d al-Sa’idi, who said: “A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, I have come to give myself (in marriage) to you.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked at her and looked her up and down, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) lowered his head and paused. When the woman saw that he had not made a decision about her, she sat down. A man from among the Sahabah said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, if you are not interested in her, then marry her to me.’ He said, ‘Do you have anything?’ He said, ‘No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah.’ He said, ‘Go to your people and see if you can find anything.’ So the man went, then he came back and said, ‘No, by Allah, I could not find anything.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, ‘Look and see (if you can find anything), even if it is only an iron ring which you can give.’ So he went, then came back, and said, ‘No, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah, not even an iron ring. But (I have) this izar (garment) of mine, she can have half of it.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘What can she do with your izar? If you are wearing it she will have nothing of it.’ The man sat down, then after a long time had passed, he got up (to leave). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw him leaving and called him. When he came, he said, ‘What do you know of the Quran ?’ He said, ‘Soorah Such-and-Such and Soorah Such-and-Such.’ He said, ‘Do you know them by heart?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘Then go, you are married to her by what you know of the Quran.’” This hadith shows that it is permissible for the mahr to be a little or a lot of whatever is considered to be wealth, if both partners agree, because an iron ring is extremely little. This is the madhhab of al-Shafi’i and is also the view of the majority of scholars among the earlier and later generations. This was also the view of Rabi’ah, Abu’l-Zinad, Ibn Abi Dhib, Yahya ibn Sa’id, al-Layth ibn Sa’d, al-Thawri, al-Awza’i, Muslim ibn Khalid, Ibn Abi Layla, Dawud, the fuqaha of the scholars of hadith and Ibn Wahb among the companions of Malik. It was also the view of all the scholars of the Hijaz, Basrah, Kufa and Syria, and others, that whatever the couple agree upon is permissible (as a dowry), whether it is a lot or a little, such as a whip, a pair of shoes or an iron ring, etc. Mahr of the Mothers of the Believers With regard to the question about the mahr of the Mothers of the Believers: Muslim narrated in his Sahih (no. 1426) that Abu Salamah ibn ‘Abd al-Rahman said: “I asked ‘Aishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), what the mahr given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was. She said: ‘The mahr that he gave to his wives was twelve uqiyah and a nashsh.’ He said, Do you know what a nashsh is? He said, she said it is half of an uqiyah. That was five hundred dirhams. This was the mahr given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to his wives.” Ibn Khaldun said: “The consensus of the scholars from the beginning of Islam and the time of the Sahabah and the Taabi’in has been that the shar’i dirham is that of which ten coins weigh seven mithqals of gold. The uqiyah is forty dirhams of this type, and on this basis it is seven-tenths of a dinar… All of these amounts are agreed upon by scholarly consensus (ijma’).” (Al-Muqaddimah, p. 263) Based on this, the weight of a dirham in grams is 2.975 grams. So the mahr of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was 500 x 2.975 = 1487.5 grams of silver. The price of one gram of pure silver that has not been worked is approximately 1 riyal, so the mahr in riyals is approximately 1487.5 riyals. In dollars it is approximately $396.70 (this varies depending on the present price of silver). For more, please see these answers: 10525 . 185602 , 102507 , 10089 and 20154 .

      "Praise be to Allah.First of all, we would like to congratulate our sister for embracing Islam, which is the joy for which wealth and souls would be sacrificed, for all the blessing of Islam makes all grief and distress fade into insignificance. The sister says that she loves a Muslim man. We say: it is not appropriate for a Muslim woman to fall into the trap of nonsensical emotions and forbidden relationships into which others fall. The love which people hear about and read about is one of the dazzling tricks of the Shaytaan, and it usually happens with regard to things that Allaah has forbidden. If a man finds that he likes a girl, the only option he has is to ask her guardian (walee) for permission to marry her. The mans mothers comment that new Muslims cannot be good Muslims is false. Were the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) anything but new Muslims, given that prior to their Islam they had been believers in Shirk? Does any Muslim have any doubts about their commitment to religion and their character? Moreover, we see that many new Muslims are many times better than many (born) Muslims! Just because a Muslim is new does not mean that he will never be good, and just because a Muslim is born in Islam does not mean that he is good. What counts is Taqwa (piety, awareness of Allaah) and righteous deeds, as well as the length of time one has been in Islam and has been worshipping Allaah. There is no reason why knowledge of the man's marriage should not be withheld from his parents, especially since this is in the interests of the sister and there are so few people who can help her to overcome her difficulties. It is the woman who needs a walee according to shareeah, not the man. However, we would prefer that he wins his familys approval by convincing them, because this is in their best interests, benefits which may be lost if they find out that their son concealed his marriage from them. The fact that the husband says he wants to call the children to Islam is good. We ask Allaah to help him to achieve this. The fact that the Hindu father is evil is sufficient reason for him not to make an open display of his calling the children to Islam, if that could lead to this kaafir taking the children away by going to the kaafir courts. You have to act with wisdom in this case. The woman who is asking this question should not arrange her own marriage even if she has been previously married, because shareeah does not permit this. If she does not have a walee as required by shareeah, then her walee may be the qaadi (judge) or whoever is in charge of the Muslim affairs in her country, such as the head of the Islamic centre or his deputy. They especially the sister have to seek the help of Allaah in dealing with these problems which are giving her sleepless nights. Everyone should know that whoever puts his trust in Allaah, Allaah will show him a way out. She has to make duaa sincerely, and he has to try as hard as he can to advise his family and change their views about new Muslims by showing them real examples of people who are the opposite of what they think. With regard to the tragedy caused by the former husband, we advise her again not to make an open display of her calling the children to Islam, lest that should cause the father to do something that will have bad consequences. If they feel suspicious about his intentions, there is no harm in calling the police to do whatever is necessary with regard to him. If getting married means that the sister will lose her right to custody of her children, we advise her not to get married now, for fear that these two souls may end up in Hell in the Hereafter unless she fears that she herself may commit some immoral action, in which case she should marry the Muslim man whom she has told us about, with witnesses and a walee as we have stated above. Publicizing the marriage is sunnah, although it does not have to be announced officially and in writing. But this sister has to live in a protective Muslim environment and those people will have to know about her marriage lest she bring upon herself gossip about her honour. If it will be better for her to leave the place where her ex-husband lives and move to another place where she can be free, have custody of her children and be able to marry a believing Muslim man who will protect her and her children, then she should do that. She has to make duaa and turn to Allaah to relieve her distress and grief. We pray that Allaah will give her the strength to do that which He loves and which pleases Him. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Islam continues to be successful in the developed world, and elsewhere, because its call is in accordance with the fitrah or natural inclinations of mankind, and it advocates the best of human values, such as tolerance, love, mercy, truthfulness and sincerity. Islam educates people and lifts them up to righteous conduct, good manners and virtue. Its call is distinguished from others by its realism, balance and moderation. Islam pays due attention to both the soul and the body. It neither suppresses physical desires nor allows extravagance in this regard; it makes a distinction between the natural inclination to enjoy the pleasures of this world and forbidden desires that come under the heading of depravity and perversion. People embrace Islam because they find security, comfort and peace in it, they see a cure for their problems in it, and through it they are able to get rid of their feelings of confusion, anxiety and loss. Islam is the religion of the fitrah, the natural inclination or pattern on which Allaah has created mankind. For this reason, people of sound minds and upright inclinations embrace Islam, as Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘There is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah (i.e., Islam), then his parents make him into a Jew, a Christian or a Magian (Zoroastrian), just as animals produce whole animals (i.e., the animals are born perfect with no part of their bodies missing). Do you find any born with their ears cut off?’” Then Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “ ‘… Allaah’s handiwork according to the pattern on which He has made mankind: no change (let there be) in the work (wrought) by Allaah: that is the Standard Religion…’ [al-Room 30:30 – interpretation of the meaning – Yusuf Ali’s translation].” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1359). What is meant is that Allaah has created mankind with the potential to learn the truth, accept Tawheed (pure monotheism) and submit to Allaah. Their natural inclination is to learn Islam and love it, but a bad education, a disbelieving environment, their own whims and desires and the devils among jinn and mankind turn them away from the truth. Mankind is basically inclined towards Tawheed (pure monotheism), as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reported that his Lord (Allaah) said: “I created all my slaves as ‘hunafa’ (pure monetheists), but the devils turned them away from their religion.” (Reported by Muslim). For this reason the one who becomes a Muslim after having been a disbeliever is described as having “reverted” to Islam, as this is more correct than saying that he “converted.” When Islam enters a country where there is no nationalism or great legacy of jaahiliyah (ignorance), it spreads quickly because of its strength and the small number of obstacles. You may also see that Islam is suitable for all people, educated and uneducated, male and female, old and young; everyone finds in it what he wants and needs. Those who become Muslim in developed countries realize what their country’s civilization and laws, which have been fabricated from men’s whims and desires, have done to them, and they realize the extent of the misery in which people in developed countries are living. They see how prevalent psychological illnesses, nervous breakdowns, insanity and suicides are, despite the technological advances and great number of discoveries and inventions and modern systems of management. This is because all of that is concerned only with the physical and the outward, but it neglects the inward and fails to nourish and nurture the heart and soul. Allaah says of these people (interpretation of the meaning): “They know only the outside appearance of the life of the world, and they are heedless of the Hereafter.” [al-Room 30:7] Islam will continue to succeed, with the permission of Allaah, so long as those who work for its sake are sincere and its followers adhere to it and believe in it, and apply its laws. The fact that there are those who are not committed or who fall short will not prevent Islam from succeeding, with the permission of Allaah, and nothing can distort its beauty. Its light will not falter because some people abandon it or fail to adhere to it. What Islam has given humanity in the way of progress and civilization, and lifting them up from the darkness of oppression and enmity, is pride enough.\n",

And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And all of beg Allaah to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful. [al-Noor 24:31] This little boy is a small child who has no sense of the shame of sex, so it is permissible to uncover one's adornment in front of him. Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his Tafseer: The words (interpretation of the meaning), or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex refer to children who because of their young age do not understand anything about women or the temptation they may present, such as their soft voices or the way they walk. Because the child is so young, he does not understand anything about that, so there is nothing wrong with letting him enter upon women. But if a boy is approaching puberty and beginning to understand these things and to distinguish between who is beautiful and who is not, then he should not be allowed to enter upon women.

      "Praise be to Allah.Fasting is not only a remedy, it is also a purification of the soul and a means of earning reward and the pleasure of Allaah. It is also a striving against one’s desires. With a little patience and the hope of earning reward, one can get used to fasting. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)” [al-Baqarah 2:183] In the Tafseer of this aayah it was said that according to one opinion, the phrase “that you may become al-muttaqoon” means: that you may stay away from sin, because fasting is more of a deterrent and is more effective in keeping one from falling into sin. This is one of the meanings of the hadeeth, “Let him fast for that will be a protection for him.” Many people think that this is because fasting weakens the body and thus weakens desire. Even if that is the case, it is in addition to the fact that fasting motivates a person to keep away from anything that he fears may affect him adversely, either because of the blessing of the fast itself or because if the one who is fasting has to refrain from food and drink that are permissible, it is even more appropriate that he should keep away from things which are forbidden. Fataawa al-Subki, part 1: al-Siyaam: Hifz al-Siyaam ‘an Fawt al-Tamaam When young people who are unable to marry were commanded to fast, this is a sign of the wisdom and insight of the Lawgiver. It is clear that fasting has an effect in this regard and that it helps to control desire and reduce provocation. With regard to your question about taking medication that can reduce desire, there is no reason why you cannot take some herbal extracts etc. to control your desires, so long as they are not harmful in any way. But this will not be of much help if you do not do some acts of worship to fill your time and other activities to use up your physical energy, such as Da’wah activities and helping those in need. Also reduce your intake of rich foods, do some sports activities, keep yourself busy with useful things, and make yourself a schedule that will use up your excess physical energy. Do not forget that it is also very important to keep away from sources of provocation. Be optimistic and do not think that you will remain in this situation for many years.

      "Praise be to Allah.It seems that your mother in is need of care and compassion, and at the same time she seems to be feeling some nostalgia for the past, by wishing to go back to her former corrupt religion. The former stems from her losing her position through the divorce which has taken place, so you and your brothers and sisters must make up for what she has lost to reduce the pain and bitterness of the humiliation she has suffered through this divorce. Most of the responsibility will fall on your shoulders because you are the closest of her children to her, as you say. You must enjoin your brothers and sisters to fulfil their duties of caring for her and looking after her, by speaking kindly to her, consoling her gently, serving her, taking care of her affairs, spending on her, visiting her, keeping in touch and upholding the ties of kinship, until things settle down for her and she feels better. With regard to the second issue, her nostalgia for her former, corrupt religion, you must deal with this problem by advising her and making the effort to explain the seriousness of apostasy and returning to kufr. Tell her about the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): “There are three things, if a person has them, he has found the sweetness of faith: if Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anyone or anything else; if he loves another and does not love him for any reason other than for the sake of Allaah; and if he would hate to return to kufr after Allaah has saved him from it as much as he would hate to be thrown into the fire.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. This version was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, no. 460). Alarm her with the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, those who have turned their backs as disbelievers after the guidance has been manifested to them, Shaytaan has beautified for them (their false hopes), and (Allaah) prolonged their term (age).” [Muhammad 47:25]. Explain to her the fate of the apostate as described in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “…And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will be the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever.” [al-Baqarah 2:217]. If you try your hardest, you will not be to blame if something that you dislike happens after that. But whatever the case, you must not carry out any last wishes or will to burn the body after death (cremation), because this is something that is viewed as abhorrent in Islamic sharee’ah (see Question #675).

None has the right to be worshipped but You. You created me and I am Your slave, and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise (to You) as much as I can. I seek refuge with You from all the evil I have done. I acknowledge before You all the blessings You have bestowed upon me, and I confess to You all my sins. So I entreat You to forgive my sins, for nobody can forgive sins except You).” Whoever says this during the day, having faith in it and dies before the evening comes, will be among the people of Paradise, and whoever says it during the night, having faith in it, and dies before the morning comes, will be among the people of Paradise.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5831). Abu Moosa reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite the following du’aa’: “Allaahumma’ghfir li khatee’ati wa jahli wa israafi fi amri wa maa anta a’lam bihi minni. Allaahumma’ghfir li jiddi wa hazli wa khata’i wa ‘amdi wa kullu dhaalika ‘indi. Allaahumma’ghfir li maa qaddamtu wa maa ajjartu wa ma asrartu wa maa a’lamtu wa maa anta a’lam bihi minni. Anta’l-muqaddim wa anta’l-mu’akhkhir wa anta ‘ala kulli shay’in qadeer ( Allaah, forgive me for my sin. My ignorance and my transgression (in keeping my duty to You), and whatever You know about me better than I do. O Allaah, forgive me for sins committed in earnest and in jest, by mistake and deliberately, and I have done all of that. O Allaah, forgive me for what I have done in the past and what I will do in the future, what I have done in secret and what I have done openly, and whatever You know about me better than I do. You are the One Who raises and lowers people’s status, and You are Able to do all things).” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5919, and Muslim, 4896. This version reported by Muslim). Ibn ‘Umar reported that the people counted for the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he recited one hundred times in one gathering: “Raabi’ghfir li wa tubb ‘alayya innaka anta’l-tawwaab ul-ghafoor (My Lord, forgive me and accept my repentance, for You are the Acceptor of Repentance, the All-Forgiving).” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3356. He said, This is a ghareeb saheeh hasan hadeeth). May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. It is permissible for a person who is praying alone to intend to lead the prayer, and act as imaam for those who join him in the prayer. The evidence for that is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (667) and Muslim (763) from Ibn ‘Abbaas who said: “I stayed one night with my maternal aunt Maymoonah bint al-Haarith, and I said to her, ‘When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gets up, wake me up so that I can pray qiyaam al-layl.’ The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) got up, and I got up and stood beside him on his left. He took my hand and made me stand on his right, and whenever I closed my eyes he tweaked my ear, then he prayed eleven rak’ahs, then he slept until I could hear the sound of his breathing. When Fajr came he prayed two short rak’ahs. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 667; Muslim, 763). The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) started praying alone, then when Ibn ‘Abbaas joined him in prayer, he led him in the prayer. Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked this question: If I enter the mosque after the congregation (jamaa’ah) has finished praying, and I say the iqaamah for the prayer and say “Allaahu akbar” to start the prayer, then a man comes in after me and joins me in my prayer, and I did not intend that, is his prayer valid or not? He answered: The correct view is that it is prescribed for you to form the intention of leading the prayer when one or more persons join you in prayer, because praying in congregation is something that is required and there is a great deal of virtue in that. Some of the scholars are of the view that this is valid in naafil prayers, but the correct view is that it is valid in both naafil (supererogatory) and fard (obligatory) prayers, because the basic principle is that the rulings on both are the same, except in cases where there is specific evidence. It was proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray on his own at night in the house of Maymoonah, the maternal aunt of Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them all). Ibn ‘Abbaas got up, did wudoo’ and stood to the left of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made him move to his right. (Agreed upon) and led him in prayer. Muslim narrated in his Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was praying alone, and Jaabir and Jabbaar came to him and stood to his right and his left. He made them stand behind him and led them in prayer. These two hadeeth indicate what we have mentioned. They also indicate that if there is only one other person, he should stand to the right of the imam, and if there are two or more they should stand behind him.

      "Praise be to Allah.The fact there is scholarly consensus, and many texts stating the order of aayahs in one soorah, that is very well known. The consensus was reported by many scholars, including Al-Zarkashi in al-Burhaan and Abu Ja’far, who said: “The order of the aayahs in their soorahs came about because this is how it was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and there is no dispute among the Muslims with regard to this matter.” The texts regarding this matter include the following: The report narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaa’i, Ibn Hibbaan and al-Haakim from Ibn ‘Abbaas, who said: “I said to ‘Uthmaan, ‘What made you put al-Anfaal which is one of the Mathaani, next to Baraa’ah [al-Tawbah], which is one of the Mi’een? Why did you not put the line Bismillaah ir-Rahmaan ir-Raheem in between them when you put it at the beginning of the rest of al-Sab’ al-Tiwaal [the long seven soorahs]?” ‘Uthmaan said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to receive revelation of soorahs with many aayahs. When they were revealed, he would call his scribes and tell them, ‘Put these aayahs in the soorah where such-and-such is mentioned.’ Al-Anfaal was one of the first soorahs to be revealed in Madeenah, and Baraa’ah (al-Tawbah) was one of the last parts of the Qur’aan to be revealed. Its stories were similar to the stories mentioned in al-Anfaal, so it was thought that it was part of it. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was taken [i.e., died] without explaining whether it was indeed part of it, so they were put next to one another, and the line Bismillaahi ir’Rahmaan ir’Raheem was not written between them, and it [al-Tawbah] was put among the Sab’ al-Tiwaal [seven long soorahs].” (Al-Haakim said: its isnaad is saheeh, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. Al-Mustadrak, 2/330) Ahmad narrated in al-Musnad (4/218) with a hasan isnaad from ‘Uthmaan ibn Abi’l-‘Aas that he said: “I was sitting with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he fixed his gaze on something, then lowered his gaze until he was almost looking at the ground, then he gazed at something. He said, ‘Jibreel (peace be upon him) came to me and told me to put this aayah in this place in this soorah: “Verily, Allâh enjoins Al-‘Adl (i.e. justice and worshipping none but Allâh Alone Islâmic Monotheism) and Al-Ihsân [i.e. to be patient in performing your duties to Allâh, totally for Allâh’s sake and in accordance with the Sunnah (legal ways) of the Prophet in a perfect manner], and giving (help) to kith and kin (i.e. all that Allâh has ordered you to give them, e.g., wealth, visiting, looking after them, or any other kind of help), and forbids Al-Fahshâ’ (i.e. all evil deeds, e.g. illegal sexual acts, disobedience of parents, polytheism, to tell lies, to give false witness, to kill a life without right), and Al-Munkar (i.e. all that is prohibited by Islâmic law: polytheism of every kind, disbelief and every kind of evil deeds), and Al-Baghy (i.e. all kinds of oppression). He admonishes you, that you may take heed.” [al-Nahl 16:90 – interpretation of the meaning].’” Al-Bukhaari narrated in al-Saheeh (no. 4536) that Ibn Abi Maleekah said: “Ibn al-Zubayr said: ‘I said to ‘Uthmaan, “This aayah that is in al-Baqarah (interpretation of the meaning), ‘And those of you who die and leave wives behind them … And those of you who die and leave behind wives should bequeath for their wives a year’s maintenance and residence without turning them out’ [al-Baqarah 2:234-240] has been abrogated by the other, so why are you writing it down it down?” He said, “Leave it as it is, my nephew, I will not change anything from its place.”’” Muslim narrated (no. 1617) that ‘Umar said: “I did not ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about anything more than I asked him about al-Kalaalah [those who die leaving neither ascendants nor descendents as heirs], until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said, “Is not aayat al-sayf [?] at the end of Soorat al-Nisa’ enough for you?” There are also the ahaadeeth about the aayahs at the end of Soorat al-Baqarah. Muslim narrated (no. 809) from Abu al-Darda’ that whoever memorizes the first ten aayahs of Soorat al-Kahf will be protected from the Dajjaal; according to another version, whoever recites the last ten verses will be protected. The Prophet’s recitation of various soorahs in the presence of his companions indicates that the order of their aayahs is something that was instituted and commanded by him, and that the Sahaabah did not put the aayahs in a different order from that in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite them. The reports to that effect reach the level of Mutawaatir. Al-Qaadi Abu Bakr said in al-Intisaar: “The order of the aayahs is something that is obligatory and binding. Jibreel used to say (to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)), ‘Put such and such an aayah in such and such a place.’” He also said: “What we think is that all of the Qur’aan which Allaah revealed and commanded that it should be written down, and which was not abrogated after being revealed, is that which is contained between the covers of the Mus-haf of ‘Uthmaan, and that there is nothing lacking or added to it. Its order is the same as that commanded by Allaah, may He be exalted, and instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Nobody has moved any aayah backwards or forwards. The Ummah learned from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the order of the aayahs of each soorah properly, just as they learned from him the correct pronunciation and recitation.” Al-Baghawi said in Sharh al-Sunnah: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to instruct his companions and teach them what was revealed to him of the Qur’aan in the order in which it appears in our Mus-hafs now, the order which Jibreel taught him. When each aayah was revealed, Jibreel would tell him, this aayah is to be written after such and such an aayah in Soorah such and such. Thus it is clear that the efforts of the Sahaabah were limited solely to gathering the Qur’aan in one place, not to arranging its order. The Qur’aan is written on al-Lawh al-Mahfooz in this order, then Allaah sent it down in its entirety to the first heaven, whence it was revealed in stages as it was needed, and the order in which it was revealed is not the order in which it is recited.” With regard to the order of Soorahs, was this also instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or was this the ijtihaad of the Sahaabah? With regard to this question, there were differences among the scholars. The majority of scholars, including Maalik and al-Qaadi Abu Bakr, according to one of his two opinions, favoured the second opinion. Ibn Faaris said: “There were two aspects to the compilation of the Qur’aan. One was putting the soorahs in a certain order, such as putting al-Sab’ al-Tiwaal (the seven long soorahs) first, and following them with the Mi’een, which is what the Sahaabah did. The second aspect is the compilation of the aayahs within the soorahs. This was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who recited them as he was told to by Jibreel, on the command of his Lord. On this basis the salaf differed as to the order in which the soorahs should appear. Some of them put them in order of revelation, which was the mus-haf of ‘Ali, which started with Iqra’ (al-‘Alaq), then al-Muddaththir, then Noon (al-Qalam), then al-Muzzammil, and so on. The Mus-haf of Ibn Mas’ood started with al-Baqarah, then al-Nisa’, then Aal ‘Imraan, with other major differences. The Mus-haf of Ubayy was similar.” Al-Karmaani said in al-Burhaan: the order of the soorahs as it is now is the same as that in al-Lawh al-Mahfooz which is with Allaah. This is the order in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to review the soorahs of the Qur’aan he had received so far with Jibreel each year. In the year in which he died, he reviewed it with him twice, and the last aayahs to be revealed were (interpretation of the meaning): ‘And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allaah…’ [al-Baqarah 2:281]. Jibreel commanded the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to put this between the aayahs dealing with riba and those dealing with loans.” Al-Zarkashi said in al-Burhaan: “The difference between the two views is one of wording. Those who support the second view say that it was taught to them so that they could learn the reasons of Revelation and the sequence of the words. Hence Maalik said that they compiled the Qur’aan according to what they had heard from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as well as saying that the order of the soorahs was the product of their ijtihaad. He said that the dispute boils down to one question which is: was this a verbal instruction of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or were they merely referring to what he used to do, which would give them room for ijtihaad.” Al-Bayhaqi said in al-Madkhil: “At the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), the soorahs and aayahs of the Qur’aan were in this order, except for al-Anfaal and Baraa’ah (al-Tawbah), as we see from the hadeeth of ‘Uthmaan referred to above.” Ibn ‘Atiyah said: “The order of many of the soorahs was known during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), such as the seven long soorahs, those that begin with Ha’-Meem, and al-Mufassal. With regard to the others, it may be the case that it was left for the Ummah to determine their order after he died.” Abu Ja’far said: “The reports support most of what Ibn ‘Atiyah said, and a little is left which is open to debate, such as the hadeeth, ‘Recite the two shining ones, al-Baqarah and Aal ‘Imraan.’” (Reported by Muslim, no. 804). Al-Bukhaari narrated (no. 4739) that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Bani Israa’eel (al-Israa’), al-Kahf, Maryam, Ta-Ha and al-Anbiya’, these are among the earliest and most beautiful soorahs and they are my treasures,” (meaning, these are among the earliest I recited). Abu Ja’far al-Nahhaas al-Mukhtaar said that the soorahs were compiled in this order from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) because of the hadeeth of Waathilah, “In place of the Tawraat I was given the seven long soorahs.” He said: “This hadeeth indicates that the order of the Qur’aan was taken from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Ibn Hajar said, “the fact that the soorahs , or most of them, are in a given order does not contradict the idea that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What proves that this was instituted by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the report narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood from Aws ibn Hudhayfah, who said: ‘We asked the companions of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the morning, “How did you write down the Qur’aan in chapters?” They said, “We wrote it down in chapters of six soorahs, five soorahs, seven soorahs, nine soorahs, eleven soorahs and thirteen soorahs, and the chapter of al-Mufassal, from Qaaf until the end. This indicates that the order of the soorahs – as it appears in the Mus-haf now – existed at the time of the Messenger of Allaah, or it is possible that what was known in order at that time was Hizb al-Mufassal specifically, which is not the case with the rest.” See al-Itqaan fi ‘Uloom al-Qur’aan by al-Suyooti, 1/62-65).

      "Praise be to Allah.If a man has completed the marriage contract (aqd nikaah) with a woman according to Islamic law, everything is permissible for him, he may look at her, be alone with her, enjoy physical contact with her, and so on, but his wife is not obliged to obey him and he is not obliged to spend on her until she submits herself to him, which according to the customs of most people nowadays happens after the waleemah or wedding party. Some mothers and fathers do not like their daughter to be alone with her husband between the aqd (nikaah) and waleemah because they are afraid of some problem arising that may cause the break up of the marriage, and their daughter may then no longer be a virgin, or she may become pregnant, and if the waleemah is delayed her pregnancy will be obvious to people, or other situations which may cause embarrassment to the parents. Parents may have concerns of which their children may not be aware, and which a daughter may not see as important because she is so excited and happy about her new husband. Although it is permissible for the couple to enjoy physical contact after the nikaah is completed even before the waleemah they should respect their parents wishes and pay attention to their concerns. The husband should also understand their concerns and should remain content with family visits until things settle down, i.e., after the waleemah.

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, tells us that Jesus (upon whom be peace) was raised up to heaven just one time, in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “But Allaah raised him up (with his body and soul) unto Himself…” [al-Nisa’ 4:158] and Allaah does not tell us that Jesus was sent back to this earth. So those who claim that Jesus was sent back to this earth have to bring us evidence and proof. If they cannot do that – and they will never be able to do it – then their argument has no basis. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) when Allaah said: ‘O Eesa (Jesus)! I will take you and raise you to Myself and clear you [of the forged statement that ‘Eesa (Jesus) is Allaah’s son] of those who disbelieve, and I will make those who follow you (monotheists, who worship none but Allaah) superior to those who disbelieve [in the oneness of Allaah, or disbelieve in some of His Messengers, or in His Holy Books] till the Day of Resurrection. Then you will return to Me and I will judge between you in the matters in which you used to dispute.”[Aal ‘Imraan 3:55] Ibn Jareer, may Allaah have mercy on him, explained that the word “mutawaffeeka” [which usually refers to death and is translated here as “raise” – Translator] refers to his being taken up, but most of the scholars said that the meaning here is sleep, as Allaah says elsewhere in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “It is He, Who takes your souls [yatawaffaakum] by night (when you are asleep)…”[al-An’aam 6:60] “It is Allaah Who takes away [yatawaffaa] the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep…”[al-Zumar 39:42] When he got up from sleeping, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would say, “Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi ahyaanaa ba’da maa amaatanaa wa ilayh il-nushoor (Praise be to Allaah Who has brought us back to life after causing us to die, and unto Him is the resurrection).” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6312; Muslim, 2711) Allaah’s statement that He raised Jesus up to heaven is also a refutation of the Jews’ claim to have killed him. Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): “Because of their breaking the covenant, and of their rejecting the aayat (signs) of Allaah, and of their killing the Prophets unjustly, and of their saying, ‘Our hearts are wrapped (with coverings, i.e., we do not understand what the Messengers say)’ – nay, Allaah has set a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief, so they believe not but a little. And because of their (Jews’) disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary) a grave false charge (that she had committed illegal sexual intercourse); And because of their saying (in boast), ‘We killed Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allaah’ – but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of ‘Eesa (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e., ‘Eesa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary)]. But Allaah raised him [‘Eesa (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allaah is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise. And there is none of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him [‘Eesa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of Allaah and a human being], before his death. And on the Day of Resurrection, he [‘Eesa (Jesus)] will be a witness against them.”[al-Nisa’ 4:155-159] Jesus (peace be upon him) has not died yet; Allaah raised him up unto Himself because the Jews wanted to kill him, and he will descend again at the end of time and rule the earth according to Islam. He will live for as long as Allaah wants him to, then he will die and the Muslims will pray [the janaazah or funeral prayer] for him. Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The pronoun in the phrase before his death refers to Jesus (peace be upon him), i.e., there is none of the People of the Book but must believe in Jesus – that is when he comes back down to the earth before the Day of Resurrection, as we will explain below. At that time all of the People of the Book will believe in him because he will abolish the jizyah (tax paid by non-Muslims in an Islamic state) and will accept nothing but Islam… The aayah (interpretation of the meaning) “and [I will] clear you of those who disbelieve” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:55] means “by raising you up to heaven” and “I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection” is what did indeed happen. When Allaah took the Messiah (peace be upon him) up into heaven, his followers split into different groups. Some of them believed in what Allaah had sent him with, that he was a slave and messenger of Allaah, the son of His female slave. Some of them exaggerated about him and made him the son of God, and others said that he was God, or that he was the third of three (trinity). Allaah described what they said in the Qur’aan, and refuted all of them. They continued like that for nearly three hundred years, then one of the Greek kings called Constantine came along and entered the Christian religion. It was said that this was a plot to corrupt the religion, that he was a philosopher, or that he was ignorant. Whatever the case, he changed and distorted the religion of the Messiah, adding things and taking things away. It was at the time of Constantine that pork was permitted and they began to pray towards the East; they made images in their churches, shrines and monasteries, and added ten days to their fasting because of a sin that he had committed, as they claim. The religion of the Messiah became the religion of Constantine. He built more than twelve thousand churches, shrines and monasteries for them, and the city that bore his name [Constantinople – now Istanbul]. A sect of Christians followed him and they prevailed over the Jews with the help of Allaah, because they were closer to the truth, even though all of them were disbelievers. When Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), some of those who believed in him believed truly in Allaah, His angels, His Books and His Messengers, so they were followers of every Prophet who had ever lived on earth.

      "Praise be to Allah.The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) spoke the truth when he said, I am not leaving behind any fitnah (trial, temptation) more harmful to men than women. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4706). He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: This world is sweet and dazzling, and Allaah has you put in charge of it to see how you will do and what you will do, so beware of this world and beware of women, for the first fitnah (temptation, trial) that befell the Children of Israel was concerning women. (Reported by Muslim, 4925). You have to deal with two things, one now and one in the future. As far as your past misbehaviour is concerned, you must repent sincerely to Allaah right now, and do good deeds to expiate for your bad deeds, as was reported in the hadeeth of Ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that a man kissed a woman [who was unlawful for him]; he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him about it, [saying, I met a woman in the garden, and I embraced her, touched her and kissed her]. [Here I am, judge concerning me as you wish.] [He started asking how he could expiate for this, and (the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) did not say anything]. Then Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): And perform al-salaah at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds [Hood 11:114]. The man asked, O Messenger of Allaah, is this just for me? He said, It is for all of my ummah (reported by al-Bukhaari, 495; additional material in brackets is from the reports of al-Tirmidhi, Ahmad, Muslim and Ibn Maajah, in that order), so do a lot of acts of worship and good deeds, so that Allaah may accept your repentance. As far as the future is concerned, you are not permitted at all to go to places where there is corruption and free mixing, where you are likely to meet women. You say that you cannot control yourself, so why do you go to places where you spend time chatting informally with women, and then say that you cannot resist? What you say is completely unacceptable. If you avoid the places and things that lead to evil, and do not expose yourself to it, you will protect yourself from falling into sin. Fear Allaah, for Allaah is watching you to see how you will do and what you will do. Beware of going to places that will lead you into haraam things. Remember that the more you indulge in haraam activities, the more difficult it is to retreat, so nip it in the bud. Stick to righteous company, and keep away from evil things and evil people. Do everything that will help you to remain chaste, such as hastening to marry and lowering your gaze. I ask Allaah to protect you from the temptation of women.

      "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to give charity to non-Muslims and this action will be rewarded, if they are in need of it, but they should not be given the obligatory charity, i.e. zakaat, unless they are those whose hearts are to be softened (i.e., they are close to embracing Islam). It is a condition for giving charity to non-Muslims that they should not be involvied in fighting the Muslims or driving them from their homes, because charity in such cases would be seen as helping them to wage war against the Muslims. (Fataawa Mutanawwi’ah by Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, 521). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity. It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allaah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the zaalimoon (wrong-doers – those who disobey Allaah.)” [al-Mumtahimah 60:8-9]. Muslims should seek first and foremost to give their charity to their Muslim brothers who are in need, and there are plenty of them. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The reward for the deeds of a child who has not reached puberty – meaning his good deeds – go to the child himself, not to his parents or anyone else, but his parents will be rewarded for teaching and guiding and helping him to do good, because of the report in Saheeh Muslim from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said, “A woman held up a boy and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, will his Hajj be counted?’ He said, ‘Yes, and you will have a reward.’” (Reported by Muslim, 2378) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that the Hajj would be counted for the boy, and that his mother would be rewarded for taking him on Hajj. Similarly, people other than the parents may also be rewarded for good deeds, such as teaching those under their care such as orphans, relatives, servants and other people, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever guides others to do good will have a reward similar to that of the one who does it …” (reported by Muslim in his Saheeh, 3509), and because this is a form of co-operating in righteousness and piety, which Allaah urges us to do.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.In Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah li’l-Buhooth al-‘Ilmiyyah wa’l-Iftaa, it says the following: “Making images of animate beings is haraam and earnings from doing this are haraam.” When Allaah forbids a thing, He also forbids its price. Making images of animate beings is forbidden, as it was reported in the saheeh evidence. Therefore earnings from doing this are unclean and it is not permissible to consume them. An exception is made in the case of images that are necessary, such as photos for ID documents and photos used to track down criminals and so on. It is permissible to make these images and receive payment for doing so. The one who is asking this question could work only with pictures of things that are not animate, or he can try to look for another job. Whoever gives up a thing for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him with something better.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The imaam should say the Takbeerat al-Ihraam (first Takbeer) and the Takbeeraat for the movements of the prayer aloud, so that the people behind him can hear him and follow him. If the mosque is big and the imaam’s voice cannot reach all the people who are praying, or his voice is weak because of sickness etc. or because that is his nature, some of the people praying behind him can convey the Takbeeraat [by repeating them aloud], because of the saheeh hadeeth which says that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led the people in prayer when he was sick, and Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) made the people hear the Takbeer. (Agreed upon). With regard to the person who is praying behind the imaam, the Sunnah is for him to say the Takbeer quietly so that only he himself can hear it. This also applies to his recitation of Qur’aan, Takbeeraat, saying Tasbeeh in Rukoo’ etc., the Tashahhud, the Salaam and the du’aa’, whether these words are waajib (obligatory) or naafil (supererogatory). It is not Mustahabb to make it louder than that except where there is a need to help others who cannot hear the imaam, in which case he should make it louder.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.A Muslim woman who misses any fasts in Ramadan because of being pregnant or breastfeeding must make them up after she no longer has that excuse, just like the sick person of whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days…” [al-Baqarah 2:184] A woman may space out these days (i.e., she does not have to fast them all at once, consecutively), as this is easier for her. (See also \"Seventy Questions About Fasting \"). It is better to make up missed days before the next Ramadan comes, but if the excuse is still present, she may delay making them up until she is able to do so. She should not resort to feeding poor people (instead of fasting) unless she is totally unable to fast. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The appearance of these three signs, the Mahdi, the Dajjaal and the descent of ‘Isa (peace be upon him), will undoubtedly happen, as is indicated in the saheeh reports. These three signs will appear within a short space of time, as ‘Isa (peace be upon him) will pray behind the Mahdi, and will kill the Dajjaal, as was reported in the saheeh ahaadeeth. As for when this will happen, Allaah knows best about that. As to whether it will happen soon, the texts seem to indicate this, but the question of whether it will be in our lifetime or after is part of the Unseen, which no one knows except Allaah. The Muslim should seek refuge with Allaah from fitan (tribulations) in general, and from the fitnah (tribulation) of the Dajjaal in particular; he should pray to Allaah, openly and in secret, to help him remain steadfast in this world and the next.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The scholars agree unanimously that it is permissible to eat the meat of the People of the Book, Jews and Christians, if the name of Allaah is mentioned at the time of slaughter, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Eat not of that (meat) on which Allaah’s Name has not been pronounced (at the time of slaughtering of the animal)…” [al-An’aam 6:121]. If the person mentioned a name other than that of Allaah, such as the name of ‘Uzayr or of the Messiah, then it is not permissible to eat of it, because of the general meaning of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “He has forbidden you… that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah.” [al-Baqarah 2:173]. It is also a condition that the meat should be slaughtered in the manner prescribed by sharee’ah. If it is known that the slaughter was not done in the proper Islamic manner, e.g., by strangulation or electric shock and so on, then it is haraam. As for the claim that some make, that it is enough merely to mention the name of Allaah when eating, this was reported regarding some Muslims who were new in Islam. The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about this, saying, “O Messenger of Allaah, some people who are new in Islam brought us some meat, and we do not know whether they mentioned the name of Allaah over it or not.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Say the name of Allaah over it and eat it.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). The command should be understood as meaning that one should be on the safe side, provided that one does not know beforehand that the meat is not slaughtered properly. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If a third person comes and joins two who are praying, then the one who is praying behind the imaam should move back, because of the report narrated by Muslim, in al-Saheeh (no. 3010), from Jaabir who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stood up to pray, and I came and stood on his left. He took my hand and turned me around until I was standing on his right. Then Jabbaar ibn Sakhr came and stood on the left of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He took both our hands and pushed us back until we were standing behind him. The scholars mentioned that if there is space in front of the imaam and no space behind the two people who are praying behind him, the imaam should move forward, but if there is space behind them and no space in front of the imaam, then they should move back. If there is space both in front of the imaam and behind the two people, the two people should move back and the imaam should not move forward, because he is to be followed and should not move, and because the imaam should pray with a barrier in front of him such as a wall or pillar, etc. Imaam al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo’, 4/292: “If there is an imaam and two people praying behind him, the imaam should come forward and they should stand behind him, whether they are two men or two boys or a man and a boy… Then if there is space in front of the imaam and not behind the two people praying behind him, he should move forward or they should move back. As to which is preferable, there are two opinions. The correct view is that stated by Shaykh Abu Haamid and the majority, which is that they should move back because the imaam is to be followed and should not move. … this is if the second person joins the prayer during the qiyaam (standing). But if he comes during the tashahhud or sujood, nobody should move forward or move back until they stand up again. There is no dispute that this moving forward or back should not occur until after the second person has said the takbeer for starting the prayer, as they mentioned. And Allaah knows best.”\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.May Allaah reward you for the efforts you are making to fulfil the duty of teaching your Muslim brothers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah and the angels, and even the ant in its nest and the whale in the sea will pray for the one who teaches people good things. (Reported by al-Tabaraani from Abu Umaamah; see Saheeh al-Jaami, 1838). Your reading to the people from the books of the scholars is very good for you and for them, so keep doing that. What we advise is that a person should not speak about things of which he has no knowledge, either by commenting on the book or by answering questions. If he does not know something, he should say, Allaah knows best. He should also avoid speaking about topics he is unsure of, and should stick to things he is certain about. You are filling an important gap in the Muslim community, and for every good deed to which you call and guide others sincerely for the sake of Allaah you will receive a reward for dawah and teaching others, as well as a reward equivalent to that of those who act upon what they have learned from you, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever calls others to right guidance will have a reward like the rewards of those who follow it, without it detracting in the least from their rewards.

      "Praise be to Allah.What you mention does not stop you from becoming a Muslim at all. Islam is the religion for all of mankind, no matter what their colour, land, tribe or language. The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the Messenger to all of mankind, of all origins and countries. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say (O Muhammad): ‘O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allaah – to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. None has the right to be worshipped but He; it is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him so that you may be guided.” [al-A’raaf 7:158]. There is no superiority of anyone over anyone else in Islam, except in terms of taqwa (piety, consciousness of Allaah). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has al-taqwa (i.e., is one of the muttaqoon – the pious). Verily, Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware.” [al-Hujuraat 49:13] In His wisdom, Allaah has made mankind into different peoples and tribes so that they may know one another, not so that they may despise one another. He tells us that the differences in colour and languages are a sign of His greatness and power in creation. He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the difference of your languages and colours. Verily, in that are indeed signs for men of sound knowledge.” [al-Room 30:22] The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) affirmed the prohibition of racial discrimination and of despising coloured people, when he said in his famous speech: “O people, your Lord is One and your father [i.e., Adam] is one. There is no superiority of the Arab over the non-Arab, or of the non-Arab over the Arab, or of the red over the black, or of the black over the red – except with regard to taqwa.” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 22391) When a man insulted his brother (in Islam) for having a black mother, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, “You are a man who still has jaahiliyyah (ignorance) in him.” Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “There was an argument between me and one of my brothers whose mother was non-Arab. I insulted him about his mother, and he complained about me to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). I met the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he said, “O Abu Dharr, you are a man who still has jaahiliyyah (ignorance) in him.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim; this version narrated by Muslim, 3139). Hasten to Islam, and you will prosper. You will find in Islam that which will delight you in this world and the next. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is Sunnah to raise one’s hands in four places during the prayer: When pronouncing Takbeer al-Ihraam (the first Takbeer), when bowing in Rukoo’, when rising from Rukoo’ and when standing up after the first Tashahhud. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) started his prayer, he would say “Allaahu akbar” and raise his hands, when he bowed in rukoo’ he would raise his hands, when he said “Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah [Allaah hears those who praise Him]” he would raise his hands, and when he stood up after two Rak’ahs he would raise his hands. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2/222; Abu Dawood, 1/197). The meaning of “when he stood up after two Rak’ahs he would raise his hands” is, when he stood up after the first Tashahhud. The hands may be raised to the level of the shoulders or the ears. See Al-‘Ayni fi’l-‘Umdah, 5/7; Sharh Muslim by al-Nawawi, 4/95; Sifat Salaat al-Nabi by al-Albaani, 87.\n",

      "Contents Related What is hajama in Islam? Benefits of hijama in Islam What is the best time for hijama? References Praise be to Allah.What is hajama in Islam? Hijaamah comes from the root al-hajm, which means “sucking”, and is used of the action of draining the breast when an infant is suckled. Al-hajjaam is the name given to the cupper, and hijaamah is the name given to this profession. Al-mihjam is the name given to the tool in which blood is collected, or to the knife used by the cupper. Benefits of hijama in Islam Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Healing is to be found in three things: drinking honey, the knife of the cupper , and cauterization of fire.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/136) According to a hadeeth narrated by Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If there is any good in your medical treatments , it is in the knife of the cupper, drinking honey, or cauterization with fire, as appropriate to the cause of the illness, but I would not like to be cauterized.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/139) According to a hadeeth narrated by Anas ibn Maalik, may Allaah be pleased with him, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I did not pass by any group on the night when I was taken on the Night Journey (Isra’), but they said to me, ‘O Muhammad, tell your ummah to do cupping.’” (Reported by Ibn Maajah; it has corroborating evidence which strengthens it) Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was treated with cupping, and he paid the cupper his fee.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/124; Muslim 1202). Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah was treated with cupping by Abu Tayyibah. He commanded that he should be given two measures of food, and he spoke with his tax-collectors, who reduced his taxes. He said, “The best treatment you can use is cupping.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 10/126; Muslim, 1577) What is the best time for hijama? With regard to the times when cupping is recommended: Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best times to be treated with cupping are the seventeenth, nineteenth or twenty-first [of the month].” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2054; the isnaad is da’eef) Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever wants to be treated by cupping, let him do it on the seventeenth, nineteenth or twenty-first, lest the blood flow too copiously and kill him.” (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 3489; there is some weakness in the report) Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever is treated with cupping on the seventeenth, nineteenth or twenty first, will be healed from all diseases.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 3861, and al-Bayhaqi, 9/340. The isnad is hasan) Although the ahaadeeth quoted above are from different sources and may be weak to some extent, they give strength to one another. Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “These ahaadeeth coincide with what the doctors agree on, that cupping should be done in the second half of the month, and that the third quarter of the month is better than the beginning or the end. But if cupping is done out of necessity it is beneficial at any time, even at the beginning or end of the month. Al-Khallaal said: ‘Ismah ibn ‘Isaam told me: Hanbal told me: Abu ‘Abd-Allaah Ahmad ibn Hanbal would be treated with cupping whenever his blood increased, no matter what time it was… They disliked having cupping done on a full stomach, because that could lead to obstruction and grievous diseases, especially if the food was heavy and bad… Choosing the times mentioned above for cupping is an extra precaution, to be on the safe side and to protect one’s health, but when it comes to treating disease, whenever it is necessary it should be used.” Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “According to the doctors, the most efficacious cupping is that which is done at the second or third hour, after having intercourse or taking a bath, etc., and neither on a full nor empty stomach. With regard to specific days for administering cupping, it was reported in a hadeeth narrated from Ibn ‘Umar by Ibn Maajah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Administer cupping, may Allaah bless you, on Thursdays, and administer cupping on Mondays and Tuesdays, but avoid cupping on Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.’ It was reported with two da’eef isnads, and there is a third version, also da’eef, reported by al-Daaraqutni in al-Afraad. He also reported it with a jayyid isnaad from Ibn ‘Umar but it is mawqoof (the isnad stops at the Sahaabi). Al-Khallaal reported that Ahmad disliked cupping on the days mentioned, even though the hadeeth was not proven. It was said that a man was treated with cupping on a Wednesday and he developed leprosy because he ignored the hadeeth. Abu Dawood reported from Abu Bakrah that he disliked cupping on Tuesdays, and said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Tuesday is the day of blood, and on that day there is an hour when blood does not stop.’ The doctors are agreed that cupping in the second half of the month, especially in the third quarter, is more beneficial than cupping at the beginning or end of the month. Al-Muwaffaq al-Baghdaadi said: The body fluids (humours) flow heavily at the beginning of the month and calm down at the end, so the best time to let the blood flow is in the middle of the month.” It is clear from the above that the ahaadeeth which specify a particular time, when taken as a whole, indicate that there is a basis for this, especially since the words of the doctors are in agreement with it. If the seventeenth or nineteenth or twenty-first of a hijri month happens to be a Thursday, this is the best possible time for cupping, but this is not to say that it is not good to do it at other times. As a form of medical treatment, cupping should not be restricted to any particular time; it should be done as needed by the patient. It is essential to make sure that you do it properly; cupping should be done by one who is experienced and he or she should use instruments that are properly cleaned and sterilized. The cupper must also ensure that no blood reaches the stomach of the patient. We ask Allaah to help us and you to follow the Sunnah. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

      "Praise be to Allah.He should stand in line with the imaam, not in front of him or behind him, but perfectly in line with him, on his right. This is how Abd-Allaah ibn Abbâs stood when he prayed with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). In his Saheeh, al-Bukhaari entitled a chapter Baab yaqoomu an yameenihi al-Imaam bi hidhaaihi sawaa: idha kaanaa ithnayn (Chapter: he should stand on the right of the imaam in line with him if they are two). In this chapter he mentioned the hadeeth of Abdullah ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I stayed overnight in the house of my maternal aunt Maymoonah, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed Isha, then he came and prayed four rakahs, then he slept, then he got up and I came and stood on his left, but he put me on his right and prayed five rakahs, then two rakahs, then he fell asleep and I heard his snoring. Then he went out for the prayer. Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) also said: I came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) at the end of the night and prayed behind him. He pulled me until I was in line with him, and when the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned back to his prayer, I went back to my original position behind him. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed, and when he had finished his prayer he said to me, What is going on? I made you stand in line with me and you moved back. I said, O Messenger of Allaah, is it right for anyone to pray alongside you when you are the Messenger of Allaah whom Allaah has blessed? He liked what I said and prayed that Allaah would increase me in knowledge and understanding. The hadeeth was narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 1/330 and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani. Its isnaad is in al-Silsilat al-Saheehah, 6060. Then al-Albaani said: From this hadeeth we may understand that the Sunnah is when one man is praying alone following the imaam, he should stand alongside him on his right, not in front of him or behind him. This is the madhhab of the Hanbalis, as stated in Manaar al-Sabeel, 1/128. Abd al-Razzaaq narrated that Ibn Jurayj said: I said to Ata: If a man prays with another man, where should he stand in relation to him? He said, To his right. I said, Should he be precisely in line with him so that neither is in front of the other? He said, Yes. I said, Do you prefer that they should stand close together so that there is no gap between them? He said, Yes. In al-Muwatta it is narrated that Abd-Allaah ibn Utbah ibn Masood said: I entered upon Umar ibn al-Khattaab at midday and found him saying Tasbeeh (in the prayer). I stood behind him and he made me come closer until I was standing in line with him on his right. Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (2/191): Some of them narrated that there was scholarly consensus that one person praying alone with the imaam should stand to the right of the imaam.

      "Praise be to Allah.Yes, children will be rewarded for doing good deeds, because of the hadeeth reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (no. 1335) from Ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: “A woman lifted up a child and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, will his Hajj (pilgrimage) be counted?’ He said, ‘Yes, and you will be rewarded.’” The author of Mawaahib al-Jaleel fi Sharh Mukhtasar Shaykh al-Khaleel said, regarding the matter of children being instructed to pray when they reach the age of seven: “Al-Qaraafi said in al-Yawaaqeet fi’l-Mawaaqeet: children will earn reward for good deeds that they do because of the hadeeth (prophetic narration) of the Khath’ami woman [who lifted up her child and asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about his Hajj].” Ibn Rushd said: “The bad deeds of young children are not recorded but their good deeds will be recorded, according to the sound opinion.” Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamheed, commenting on the first hadeeth quoted therein, which is the hadeeth of the Khath’ami woman: “… Abu’l-‘Aaliyah al-Riyaahi said: ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab said: the young child’s good deeds will be recorded but his bad deeds will not be recorded.” The author of Mawaahib al-Jaleel said, concerning children entering ihraam (sacred state) for Hajj and ‘Umrah: “The scholars do not differ concerning the fact that children will be rewarded for whatever acts of obedience (to Allaah) they do, and will be let off for any bad deeds that they do, and any bad deeds they do deliberately will be counted as mistakes. It says in Mukhtasar al-Waadihah: ‘Hajj is not an obligation for boys and girls until boys reach puberty and girls begin menstruating, but there is nothing wrong with taking them for Hajj. It is recommended (mustahabb), and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did so.’” Then he reported that Talhah ibn Musarrif said: “It was one of the customs of the Muslims to take their children for Hajj and expose them to the mercy of Allaah.” Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamheed that it is encouraged to take children for Hajj, and that the majority of scholars say this. He also said: “It is nothing strange that a child should earn reward and status in the Hereafter for his salaah (prayers), zakaah (paying poor-due), Hajj and other good deeds if he does them as they should be done, (because this is) grace and mercy from Allaah, just as Allaah shows mercy to the dead by rewarding them for acts of charity done on their behalf by the living. Do you not see that they (the scholars) are agreed that a child should be commanded to pray when he reaches the age of understanding and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led Anas and the orphan in prayer? Most of the salaf (pious predecessors) said that zakaah has to be paid on the property of orphans, and it is impossible that they would not be rewarded for that. Their guardians and the one who does this on their behalf will also certainly be rewarded, as will the one who takes them for Hajj, as a blessing and mercy from Allaah. It was reported that ‘Umar said: ‘Children’s good deeds will be recorded and their bad deeds will not be recorded.’ I do not know of anyone whose opinion is worth following who said anything to the contrary.” According to al-Ikmaal, many of the scholars said: “Children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience (to Allaah), and their good deeds will be recorded, but not their bad deeds.” It says in Awaa’il al-Muqaddimaat: “The correct opinion in my view is that they are both encouraged to do that and will both be rewarded for it (i.e., the child and his or her guardian). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the woman [who asked about the child’s Hajj]: ‘… and you will be rewarded.’ And Allaah knows best.” Ibn Jamaa’ah said: “According to the four (imams/leading scholars), children will be rewarded for their acts of obedience and their good deeds will be recorded, whether they are mature or not. This was reported from ‘Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him. Some scholars report that there was consensus (ijmaa’) in this matter. It is also indicated by what we have already said under the heading of Virtues (fadaa’il), that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The jihaad (physival battle) of the very old and the very young is Hajj and ‘Umrah,’ as well as the hadeeth about the woman who lifted up a child.” And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If a person joins the imaam whilst he is praying Ishaa, but he has missed Maghrib for some legitimate reason, such as travelling, etc., then he should pray Maghrib even if the imaam is praying Ishaa, because the prayers have to be kept in the proper order. This is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did during the campaign of al-Khandaq. Jaabir ibn Abd-Allaah said: Umar came on the day of al-Khandaq cursing the kuffaar of Quraysh and saying, O Messenger of Allaah, I did not pray Asr until the sun was almost setting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, By Allaah, I have not prayed it yet either. So he went down to But-haan [the name of a valley], did wudoo and prayed Asr after the sun had set, then he prayed Maghrib. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 893) Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said in al-Fath: This hadeeth teaches us how to make up missed prayers in order, and most scholars agree that this [keeping prayers in order] is obligatory. Al-Bukhaari included this hadeeth in a chapter entitled Baab Qada al-Salawaat al-Oolaa fal-Oolaa (Chapter on making up prayers in order). In the case mentioned in the question, it is permissible for you to pray Maghrib behind an imaam who is praying Ishaa, but when he gets up for the fourth rakah, you should remain sitting and recite the Tashahhud, and it is better to wait until he sits and says the Tasleem, so that you say the Tasleem with him. Then you should go ahead and pray Ishaa. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Positions of leadership and high public office means taking on the mission of establishing Islam by reviving religious knowledge and establishing its foundations, engaging in jihad for the sake of Allah – which includes preparing armies and distributing war booty – establishing the judicial system, carrying out judicial punishments (hudud), fighting oppression, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, acting as a deputy of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There is no dispute among the scholars that one of the conditions of the imam or leader is that he should be male. Ibn Hazam reported in his book Maratib al-Ijma’ that there was scholarly consensus on this point. In the section he says: “Out of all groups of the people of the Qiblah [i.e., all Muslim sects], there is not one that allows the leadership of women.” Al-Qurtubi reported something similar, and al-‘Allamah al-Shanqiti said, “There is no difference of opinion among the scholars on this point.” The evidence for this is the general meaning of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has made one of them to excel the other…” [al-Nisa 4:34]. It is also clearly indicated by the hadith of Abu Bakrah who said that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard that the Persians had appointed the daughter of Chosroes as their queen, he said, “No people who appoint a woman as their leader will ever prosper.” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 13/53). This is because positions of leadership and government require a person to join men’s gatherings, which is not allowed for women according to shari’ah because of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance…” [al-Ahzab 33:33]. These positions also require perfect wisdom, reason and alertness, and the testimony of a man has been made equal to that of two women, the reason for which Allah has explained in the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): “… so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her…” [al-Baqarah 2:282]. Imam al-Muwaffaq Ibn Qudamah said: “For this reason the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his successors (khulafa) and those who came after them never appointed a woman to be a judge or a governor of a province, as far as we know. If it were permissible, it should have happened.” Imam al-Ghazali said: “The position of leader (imam) could never be given to a woman even if she possessed all the qualities of perfection and self-reliance. How could a woman take the position of leader when she did not have the right to be a judge or a witness under most of the historical governments?” Imam al-Baghawi said: “The scholars agreed that women are not fit to be leaders or judges, because the leader needs to go out to organize jihad and take care of the Muslims’ affairs, and the judge needs to go out to judge between people, but women are ‘awrah and it is not right for them to go out. Because of their weakness, women are not able to do many things. Women are imperfect, and the positions of leaders and judge are among the most perfect of positions for which only the most perfect of men are qualified.” Undoubtedly this is proven by reality. People know from experience that only men are fit for leadership, because women by nature are more emotional and more easily swayed by their feelings and compassion. These qualities have been created in women to enable them to carry out their most important duty, which is that of motherhood and nurturing children. Men, on the other hand, are not usually swayed by their emotions as women are. Their way is usually one of logic and deliberation, which form the essence of responsibility and leadership. With regard to the question of whether a woman may be appointed as a judge, the majority of Maliki, Shafi’i and Hanbali scholars say that a woman cannot be appointed as a judge, because of the general meaning of the hadith of Abu Bakrah quoted above. Al-Hafiz ibn Hajar said: “Ibn al-Tin said: Those who say that a woman cannot be appointed as a judge use the hadith of Abu Bakrah as evidence, and this is the view of the majority.” With regard to other administrative positions, there is no shar’i reason why women should not be appointed to run institutions where they will work with other women and not men, because in this case there are no shar’i reservations about their work. There is no validity in what most modern writers say about how women have to go out and take part in parliaments and public councils, and that these are part of the rights granted to women by Islam. These writers have not examined the issue from the correct Islamic viewpoint. The truth is clear, but unfortunately they look at it with minds filled with the heretic trends of East and West. Therefore you see them weakened and defeated, dazzled by the false civilizations of those nations, then they come and misinterpret the texts and change the words from their right places until they agree with their whims. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound.\n",

      "Related Praise be to Allah. Firstly: Allaah has prescribed rulings in Islam that are based on wisdom. The rulings are aimed at setting individuals and societies straight. The one who goes against these rulings exposes himself to punishment in the Hereafter and he may be punished in this world before that. We are not going to discuss the greatness of Allaah’s wisdom in His laws, rather we have to introduce our answer in this way because of the sister’s question, asking for the ruling on her studies or her work. She is living among the kuffaar, in their country, and they are causing trouble for her because of her religious commitment. How much pressure is this Muslim woman and many others like her living with? When will fathers and mothers pay attention and wake up from their heedlessness, and leave those lands which have caused many to lose their religion and identity? You will find that there are many wise people who regret paying too much attention to accumulating money at the expense of their religion and honour. Secondly: Staying in kaafir countries is haraam for the one who is unable to practice his religion openly or who is afraid that he may be led astray from his religion. See the answers to questions no. 27211, 14235 and 3225. Thirdly: Your studying in that country is undoubtedly in a mixed environment, and there is no doubt that you are seeing sins and immorality in those places, which pains the heart of the chaste Muslim. If studying in a Muslim country is in a mixed environment it is not permissible, so how can it be permissible in a kaafir country? The scholars of the Standing Committee for Issuing Fatwas said: For a woman to study shar’i knowledge and other fields which a woman needs to know or which will help her to know matters of her religion is something that is prescribed, so long as it will not result in anything that is not allowed in sharee’ah. But if it will result in something that is forbidden in sharee’ah, such as mixing with non-mahram men or not observing hijab, then it is not permissible, because these are haraam things, and because that will lead to corruption.

They also said: Mixing between men and women in schools and elsewhere is a great evil and leads to great corruption in religious and worldly terms. It is not permissible for a woman to study or work in a place where men and women mix, and it is not permissible for her guardian to allow her to do so. End quote.

The scholars of the Standing Committee said: It is not permissible for a woman to work with men who are not her mahrams, because of the evils that result from her presence with them. She has to seek provision through ways that do not involve anything haraam. If a person fears Allaah, He will make things easy for him. The Committee has issued a fatwa concerning that, the text of which is as follows: As for the mixing of women with men in factories and offices, in non-Muslim countries, it is not permissible. But they have something that is worse than that, which is disbelief in Allaah, so it is no surprise that such evils occur among them. As for women mixing with men in Muslim countries, at the time when they are Muslim, that is also haraam. The authorities in the places where this mixing occurs must take steps to put the women in one place and the men in another, because of the moral corruption that results from mixing, as is obvious to anyone who has the slightest insight.

      "Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Jaami al-Saheeh: Chapter: there is no divorce before marriage. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no iddah have you to count in respect of them. So give them a present, and set them free, i.e., divorce in a handsome manner. [al-Ahzaab 33:49]. Ibn Abbaas said: Allaah made divorce after marriage. Among the evidence that there is no divorce before marriage (nikaah) are the following reports: The hadeeth of Abd-Allaah ibn Amr (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no vow for the son of Adam with regard to that which he does not possess; there is no setting free of (a slave) whom he does not possess; there is no divorce of (a wife) whom he does not possess. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said: a saheeh hasan hadeeth). The hadeeth of Abd-Allaah ibn Amr (may Allaah be pleased with him), who reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No divorce except of (the wife) whom you possess; no setting free except of (the slave) whom you possess, and no selling except of (the goods) that you possess. (Reported by Abu Dawood; it is a hasan hadeeth). The hadeeth of Ibn Makhramah from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said, No divorce before marriage, and no setting free before taking possession. (Reported by Ibn Maajah; it is a hasan hadeeth). Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Abu Ubayd reported that Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) was asked about a man who said, If I marry so-and-so, then she is divorced (straightaway). Ali said: There is no divorce except after taking possession. It was also reported that Ali said: There is no divorce except after marriage even if he mentioned (the woman) by name. This is the opinion of Aaishah, and also of al-Shaafai, Ahmad and Ishaaq and their companions, and of Dawood and his companions, and of the majority of hadeeth scholars. Among the evidence to support this opinion is the fact that when a man says, If I marry so-and-so then she is divorced, at the time when this suspended divorce is uttered, the woman is still ajnabiyyah (literally, a stranger, not his wife or mahram) to him, and the thing that comes later [i.e., marriage] takes precedence over whatever went before [i.e., the vow of divorce]. Nikaah (marriage) cannot be divorce. Similarly, if he said to a woman to whom he is not married yet, If you enter the house you will be divorced, then she entered the house after she became his wife, then she is not divorced. There is no dispute (among the scholars). (Zaad al-Maaad, 5/217) And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related What is tawassul? Types of tawassul Correct Islamic tawassul Ruling on tawassul Tawassul that is bidah and forbidden Praise be to Allah.What is tawassul? Tawassul in Arabic means seeking to draw close. Allah says in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): [they] desire means of access to their Lord [al-Isra 17:57], i.e., means of drawing close to Him. Types of tawassul There are two types of Tawassul ; correct Islamic tawassul and forbidden tawassul. Correct Islamic tawassul This means seeking to draw close to Allah through acts of worship which He loves and which please Him; these may be obligatory or encouraged, and may take the form of words, actions or beliefs. Some types are as follows: 1. Seeking to draw close to Allah by means of His names and attributes. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His names. They will be requited for what they used to do.” [al-A'raf 7:180] So when a person makes du’a to Allah, he begins by calling on Allah with the name that is most apt, such as al-Rahman (the Most Merciful) when seeking mercy and al-Ghafur (the All-Forgiving) when asking for forgiveness, and so on. 1. Seeking to draw close to Allah by means of faith and Tawhid. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down, and we follow the Messenger, so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth).” [Al ‘Imran 3:53] 1. Seeking to draw close to Allah through righteous deeds, whereby a person asks Allah by virtue of the best deeds that he has done, such as salah, fasting, reading Quran, avoiding haram things, and so on. An example of this is the sahih hadith narrated in the Sahihayn about the three people who entered a cave, and a rock fell and blocked their way out. They asked Allah by virtue of their best deeds (to save them). A person may also ask Allah by virtue of his total dependency upon Him, as Allah mentions in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): “[Ayyub said:] Verily, distress has seized me, and You are the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.” [al-Anbiya 21:83]; or by admitting his own wrongdoing and his need for Allah, as Yunus is described as saying (interpretation of the meaning): “None has the right to be worshipped except You (O Allah). Glorified (and exalted) are You. Truly I have been of the wrong-doers.” [al-Anbiya 21:87] Ruling on tawassul The rulings on Islamically correct tawassul vary according to its type. Some types are wajib, such as seeking to draw close to Allah through His names and attributes and through Tawhid (believing in His absolute Oneness), and some are mustahabb, such as seeking to draw close to Him by virtue of all kinds of righteous deeds. Tawassul that is bidah and forbidden This is the attempt to draw close to Allah by means of things that He does not like and that do not please Him, whether they be words, deeds or beliefs. One example of this is trying to draw close to Allah by calling on the dead or people who are absent, asking them for help, and so on. This is a form of major shirk, which goes against Tawhid and means that a person is no longer considered to be a Muslim. Calling upon Allah, whether it is for a purpose such as asking Him to grant some benefit or to ward off some harm, or as an act of worship to express humility and submission before Him, can only be addressed directly to Allah. If du’as or prayers are addressed to anything or anyone else, this is shirk. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And your Lord said: Invoke Me (and ask Me for anything), I will respond to your invocation. Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e., do not invoke Me and do not believe in My Oneness], they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!” [Ghafir 40:60] In this verse, Allah explains the punishment of those who arrogantly refuse to call on Allah, whether they call on someone other than Allah or they do not call on Him at all, out of pride and self-admiration, even if they do not call on anyone else. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret.” [al-A'raf 7:55]. Allah commands His slaves to call on Him and not anyone else. Allah says of the people of Hell (interpretation of the meaning): “[They say:] By Allah, we were truly in a manifest error when we held you (false gods) as equals (in worship) with the Lord of the Worlds.” [al-Shu’ara 26:96-97] Anything that results in equating something other than Allah with Allah in worship or acts of obedience is shirk, the crime of associating partners with Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And who is more astray than one who calls (invokes) besides Allah, such as will not answer him until the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them? And when mankind is gathered (one the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become enemies for them and will deny their worshipping.” [al-Ahqaf 46:5-6] Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allah, any other god, of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely, al-kafirun (the disbelievers in Allah and in the Oneness of Allah) will not be successful. [al-Muminun 23:117]. Allah states that anyone who calls on anything other than him is taking that thing as a god, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a qitmir (the thin membrane over a date-stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad), like Him Who is the All-Knower (of everything).” [Fatir 35:13-14]. In this verse, Allah explains that He is the only One Who deserves to be called upon, because He, and no one else, is the Sovereign Who is directing everything. Those things that are worshipped cannot hear du’as, let alone respond to the one who invokes them, and even if they were able to hear, they cannot respond, because they do not have the power to either benefit or harm. The Arab pagans whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was sent to call were disbelievers because of this shirk. They would call upon Allah sincerely at times of difficulty, but they became disbelievers at times of ease and plenty, when they would call on others besides Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): “And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allah, making their Faith pure for Him only, but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.” [al-Ankabut 29:65] “And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him (Allah Alone). But when He brings you safely to land, you turn away (from Him).” [al-Isra 17:67] “…till when you are in the ships and they sail with them with a favourable wind, and they are glad therein, then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think that they are encircled therein, they invoke Allah, making their Faith pure for Him Alone.” [Yunus 10:33] The shirk of some people nowadays goes even further than the shirk of people in the past, because they direct some acts of worship to something other than Allah, calling upon them and asking them for help even at times of distress; la hawla wa la quwwata illa Billah (there is no strength and no help except in Allah). We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. To sum up our response to what your friend mentioned: asking the dead for anything is shirk, and asking the living for anything that no one except Allah is able to do, is also shirk.

      "Praise be to Allah.What you have achieved in your quest for the truth is great indeed. All that remains to be done is the most important step you will ever take in your life, which is to pronounce the Shahaadatayn and enter Islam. We truly appreciate the great efforts you have made by reading the entire Quraan in translation, and other books and articles about Islam, and also by already giving up some haraam things such as drinking wine and eating pork. The most important thing that you have achieved is your conviction about Islam, the Prophet of Islam and the Book of Islam. From your question we can sum up the obstacles that you face in two points: some social embarrassment some matters that you do not yet fully understand With regard to the second point, it is not a condition for becoming Muslim that a person should know the entire religion, because it is a vast ocean. You can become Muslim and then learn the religion and develop full conviction about all the rulings of Islam. At the beginning, it is sufficient to believe in the six pillars of faith in general terms (belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and predestination, both good and bad) and to understand and accept in general terms the five pillars of Islam (testifying that there is no god but Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, prayer, paying zakaah, fasting in Ramadaan, and performing Hajj to the sacred House of Allaah, for the one who is able and has the means). Realize that knowledge and conviction develop gradually, and that faith increases by doing acts of worship and obedience to Allaah, which in turn leads to a deeper understanding and acceptance of the rulings of Islam. With regard to the first point, we are sure that if you enter Islam and are sincere towards Allaah and do righteous deeds, then Allaah will give you the strength, steadfastness, courage and certainty to face all difficulties and overcome them. The experience of other women who have become Muslim before you gives you a good example of what you could be able to do in the future as regards following the rules of Islam, such as hijaab and other issues, despite being surrounded by an overwhelming atmosphere of kufr. We also say that if any woman were to ask us whether she should become Muslim despite not wearing full hijab or stay a kaafir, we would definitely tell her to become Muslim, because the seriousness and danger of remaining a kaafir is far worse than being a Muslim but committing a sin. We understand totally the difficulties and social embarrassment that you speak of, and we know that going against ones family and the society in which one lives are very difficult matters, but Allaah makes every difficult thing easy. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): And Allaah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers. [Aal Imraan 3:68] And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). [al-Talaaq 65:2] Allaah will grant after hardship, ease. [al-Talaaq 65:7] As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause), We will surely guide them to Our Paths (i.e., Allaahs Religion Islamic Monotheism) [al-Ankaboot 29:69] We also want to tell you that it is possible for a person, if he becomes Muslim and fears unbearable persecution or hardship, to conceal his Islam and keep it a secret, hiding his acts of worship from the people around him although it is difficult to do so. But for the sake of following the truth and saving oneself from the punishment of Hellfire, everything becomes easy and the believer can overcome all difficulties. Finally, we can only thank you for the efforts you have made and for sending this question. We hope that the next step, which you should take immediately, is abundantly clear to you from our answer. We will be very happy to help you with anything you may need in the future, and we ask Allaah to guide you to the path of truth, to help you and to make things easy for you. Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim to allow his wife from among the People of the Book to celebrate her festivals in his home, for the man is in charge of that woman and she does not have the right to openly celebrate her festivals in his home, because of the resulting effects of corruption, forbidden things and display of the symbols of kufr in his home. He should keep his children from taking part in those innovated festivals, because the children belong to the father and he should keep them away from these forbidden celebrations. At the same time he should direct them towards what will benefit them, even if that affects his relationship with his wife. The aims of sharee’ah and protecting one’s religion – which is one of the most important aims of sharee’ah – take priority over everything else. Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal was asked about a man who had a Christian wife – could he let her go out to join in the Christian festivals or to go to the church? He said, no. In al-Mughni (1/21), Ibn Qudaamah says: “(Treatment of women): If his wife is a dhimmiyyah [a Jew or Christian living under Islamic rule], he can prevent her from going to the church, because that is not an act of obedience to Allaah.” If these scholars said that the husband should stop a Christian wife from going to church, then what do you think is the case with regard to her celebrating these innovated festivals in the house of her Muslim husband?

Many of the movies and novels that are known as “Science Fiction” include a lot of kufr, such as putting life and death in the hands of some created being, giving creatures the ability to create from nothing, saying that scientists in laboratories can create from nothing, making inanimate things come alive, creating life from a fossil that has been dead for many millenia, or travelling to the future then coming back to the present. All of this is impossible, and no one knows the unseen except for Allaah. Some of these novels and movies also include clear contradictions of historical facts that are mentioned in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, such as man’s creation and his life on earth. When the Muslim indulges in reading these books or watching these movies, it shakes his belief or at the very least wastes his time and keeps him busy with something that is of no benefit to him. Some people claim that this is just entertainment and a way of passing time, but entertainment is not permitted if it is haraam, and the Muslim’s time is too precious to be wasted on such trivial things. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “One of the signs of a person being properly committed to Islam is that he leaves alone that which does not concern him.” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2239, and others. Also in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 5911). And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If these celebrations are the festivals of the kuffaar and mushrikeen, it is not permissible to take part in those innovated festivals, because doing so implies helping them to commit sin and transgression. Taking part in their festivals also involves imitating the kuffaar, which is forbidden in Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ahmad). ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to say: “Avoid the enemies of Allaah during their festivals.” (Reported by al-Bayhaqi). If what is referred to is accepting an invitation to a meal, for example, and there is nothing involved that is forbidden in Islam, such as mixing of men and women, or foods forbidden by Allaah such as wine and pork, or dancing and music and so on, and this participation does not imply that one loves these kuffaar, then there is nothing wrong with accepting their invitation. He should try to convey the message of Islam to them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted the invitation of some of the Jews. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is human nature to be forgetful, as the Arab poet said: He is only called man (insaan) because of his forgetfulness (nasiyaan), and it is only called the heart (al-qalb) because it changes so rapidly (yataqallib). In the past they said that the first one to forget (awwal naasin) was the first man (awwal al-naas), meaning Adam, peace be upon him. Forgetfulness is something that varies from person to person according to each individuals nature; some may be more forgetful than others. Some of the things that may help to combat forgetfulness are the following: Keeping away from sin, because the bad effects of sin result in a bad memory and the inability to retain knowledge. The darkness of sin cannot co-exist with the light of knowledge. The following words were attributed to al-Shaafa'i, may Allaah have mercy on him: I complained to [my shaykh] Wakee about my bad memory, and he taught me that I should keep away from sin. He said that knowledge of Allaah is light, and the light of Allaah is not given to the sinner. Al-Khateeb reported in al-Jaami (2/387) that Yahya ibn Yahya said: A man asked Maalik ibn Anas, O Abu Abd-Allaah! Is there anything that will improve my memory? He said, If anything will improve it, it is giving up sin. When a person commits a sin, it overwhelms him and this leads to anxiety and sorrow which keeps him busy thinking about what he has done. This dulls his senses and distracts him from many beneficial things, including seeking knowledge. Frequently remembering Allaah, may He be glorified, by reciting dhikr, tasbeeh (saying Subhan Allaah), tahmeed (Al-hamdu Lillaah), tahleel (Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah) and takbeer (Allaahu akbar), etc. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And remember your Lord when you forget [al-Kahf 18:24] Not eating too much, because eating too much makes one sleep too much and become lazy, and it dulls the senses, besides exposing one to the risk of physical diseases. Most of the diseases which we see result from food and drink. Some of the scholars have mentioned certain foods which increase the memory, such as drinking honey and eating raisins and chewing certain kinds of gum resin. Imaam al-Zuhri said: You should eat honey because it is good for the memory. He also said: Whoever wants to memorize hadeeth should eat raisins. (From al-Jaami by al-Khateeb, 2/394). Ibraaheem ibn [sth. omitted] said, You should chew resin gum, because it gives energy to the heart and gets rid of forgetfulness. (From al-Jaami by al-Khateeb, 2/397). As they mentioned, too much acidic food is one of the causes of laziness and weak memory. Another thing that can help the memory and reduce forgetfulness is cupping (hijaamah) of the head, as is well known from experience. (For more information see Al-Tibb al-Nabawi by Ibn al-Qayyim).

      "Contents Related Halal haircuts in Islam Praise be to Allah.Hairstyle of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) The hairstyle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is mentioned in a number of hadiths, such as the following: His hair was neither curly nor straight. Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said, describing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), he was of average height, neither very tall nor very short . He had a ruddy complexion, neither very white nor very dark, and his hair was neither curly nor straight. The revelation came to him when he was forty years old. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3354; Muslim, 2338) His hair came down to his earlobes. Al-Bara ibn ‘Azib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was of average height and broad shouldered. He had hair that came down to his earlobes. I saw him wearing a red garment and I never saw anyone more handsome than him. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3358; Muslim, 2337) His hair sometimes came down to his shoulders. Qatadah said: I asked Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) about the hair of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said, “The hair of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was neither curly nor straight, and came down to a point between his ears and his shoulders.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5565; Muslim, 2337) According to another report, his hair used to touch his shoulders. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5563; Muslim, 2338) Sometimes his hair was shorter than that. All of this may be understood as referring to different situations, and each of the Companions narrated what he had seen. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to dye his hair sometimes. ‘Uthman ibn ‘Abd-Allah ibn Muhib said: I entered upon Umm Salamah and she brought out to us one of the hairs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which was dyed. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5558) Ahmad (25328) added: “… dyed with henna and katam.” Katam is a plant that is used to dye hair. When mixed with henna, it gives the hair a colour between black and red. (See ‘Awn al-Ma’bud, commentary on hadith no. 4205) He used to part his hair. ‘Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to let his hair hang down over his forehead and the pagans used to part their hair, and the People of the Book used to let their hair hang down over their foreheads. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) liked to be like the People of the Book in matters where there was no specific command. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) parted his hair. ((Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3365; Muslim, 2336). Some of the scholars discussed the meaning of this hadith, and their comments were summed up by Imam al-Nawawi as follows: The correct view is that both letting the hair hang down over the forehead and parting it are permissible, but that parting is better. (Sharh Muslim, 15/90) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did his Farewell Pilgrimage when his hair was stuck together. (This means) making some parts of the hair stick to others using gum or something similar, so that the hair is held together and avoids getting dirty and does not need to be washed. This is easier for the person who is in ihram, especially in the past when the person in ihram was faced with a lot of dirt and little water. Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) raising his voice in the Talbiyah, with his hair stuck together. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5570; Muslim, 1184) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) sometimes used to braid his hair, especially when travelling, to keep it from getting dusty. Umm Hani said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came from Makkah with four braids.” (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1781; Abu Dawud, 4191; Ibn Majah, 3631. Classed as sahih by al-Hafiz Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari, 10/360” Halal haircuts in Islam With regard to the kinds of hairstyles that are forbidden, they are characterized by the following: Al-Qaza’ (lit. tufts), which is where part of the head is shaved and part is left. Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade al-qaza’. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 5466; Muslim, 3959) One of the narrators of this hadith defines al-qaza’ as shaving part of a child’s head and leaving some of his hair. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to shaving part of the head and leaving part , this is of varying degrees. The worst is shaving the middle of the head and leaving the sides, as the Christian monks do. After that comes shaving the sides and leaving the middle, as many of the foolish and worthless people do. After that comes shaving the front of the head and leaving the back. These three types all come under the heading of qaza’ which was forbidden by the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but some of them are worse than others.” (Ahkam Ahl al-Dhimmah, 3/1294) Imitating the unbelievers or immoral people. There are many such hairstyles, some of which come under the heading of qaza’ – such as the “Marines” haircut, which is forbidden for two reasons, the fact that it is a kind of qaza’ and the fact that it is an imitation of the unbelievers . Some of them do not involve qaza’ but they are styles that belong to the unbelievers, such as making some of the hair stand up and letting the rest hang down, and so on. This also includes every hairstyle that belongs to the unbelievers or immoral people, because it is not permissible for a Muslim to resemble them in that, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Whoever imitates a people is one of them.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 4031. Classed as hasan by al-Hafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bari, 10/271. its isnad was classed as jayyid by Shaykh al-Islam in Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, p. 82) Shaykh al-Islam said: “The least that we can say about this hadith is that it implies that it is haram to imitate them, although the apparent meaning is that the one who imitates them is a kafir, as in the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliya), then surely, he is one of them.” [al-Maidah 5:51]” (Iqtida al-Sirat al-Mustaqim, p. 83) Imitating foolish people. These are hairstyles worn by some of the foolish people, which may be included in the categories mentioned above. And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.With regard to the idea that Allaah forgives all sins: this is correct, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53]. Minor sins (saghaa’ir) are expiated for by doing acts of worship and by avoiding major sins (kabaa’ir), because of the following evidence (daleel): Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise)” [al-Nisaa’ 4:31] It was reported from Ibn Mas’ood that a man kissed a woman, then he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and told him about it. Then Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): “And perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as- Salaah), at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salaah (prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds (i.e. small sins).” [Hood 11:114]. The man said, O Messenger of Allaah, is this just for me? He said, “It is for all of my Ummah.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 503; Muslim, 2763) It was reported from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The five prayers and Jumu’ah are an expiation from one week to the next, so long as you do not commit major sins.” (Narrated by Muslim, 233). There are many things that expiate for minor sins, such as fasting, qiyaam, wudoo’, etc. But major sins require specific acts of expiation, such as sincere repentance, the carrying out of the Islamic punishment (hadd) on the one who committed them, etc., as can be seen in the following texts: It was reported from ‘Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, when there was a group of his Sahaabah around him: “Give allegiance to me that you will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, not steal, not commit fornication, not kill your children… and not disobey me in what is right. Whoever among you fulfils this, his reward will be with Allaah. Whoever commits any of these sins will be punished in this world and that will be an expiation for him. Whoever commits any of these sins but Allaah conceals it, then it will be for Allaah to decide: if He wills, He will forgive him, and if He wills, He will punish him.” So we gave allegiance to him on that basis. The phrase “he will be punished in this world” means, the Islamically-prescribed punishment (hadd) will be carried out on him. It was reported from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleasd with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Among the Children of Israel there was a man who killed ninety-nine people. Then he went out and came to a monk and asked him, ‘Can I repent?’ He said, ‘No,’ so he killed him. Then he started asking, and a man said to him, ‘Go to such and such a town.’ But death caught up with him, so he inclined his chest towards (that town, as he was dying). The angels of mercy and the angels of punishment disputed concerning him. Allaah inspired (the good town) to come closer to him, and (the evil town) to move away from him, then He said, Measure the distance between them. They found that he was closer to (the good town) by a hand-span, so he was forgiven.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 3283; Muslim, 2766). But if a sinner dies in a state of sin, if his sins include shirk, then Allaah will not forgive him in the Hereafter. If his sins are less than that, then the person is subject to the will of Allaah – if He wills, He will punish him and if He wills, He will forgive him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills” [al-Nisaa’ 4:48, 116]. It was reported that Ibn ‘Umar said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “The believer will be brought close to his Lord until He conceals him and makes him confess his sin. Allaah will say, ‘Do you remember such and such a sin?’ The man will say, ‘Yes, I admit it.’ The Lord will say, ‘I concealed it for you in the world and I forgive you for it today.’ Then He will close up his record of good deeds. As for the others or the Kuffaar, it will be called out before the witnesses, ‘These are the ones who disbelieved in their Lord. The curse of Allaah is upon the wrongdoers.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4408; Muslim, 2768). Your despairing of the mercy of Allaah is not permissible, because of the following evidence (daleel): Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say: “O ‘Ibaadi (My slaves) who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and sins)! Despair not of the Mercy of Allaah, verily, Allaah forgives all sins. Truly, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful” [al-Zumar 39:53]. And He says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and My Mercy embraces all things…” [al-A’raaf 7:156] It was reported from Abu Moosa that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah spreads out His hand at night to accept the repentance of those who committed sins during the day, and He spreads out His hand during the day to accept the repentance of those who committed sins during the night. (He will continue to do this) until the sun rises from the West.” (Narrated by Muslim, 2759). Speaking about your sin and flaunting it openly in front of your friends is haraam, and is a major sin. It is one of the ways of spreading immorality among the Muslims, encouraging evil and tempting others to do similar things. It also means that one does not take sin seriously and regards it as insignificant, and that the sinner is damaging his own reputation and exposing his honour to the slander of others. Islam seeks to put people off from doing such things in the strongest possible terms, as in the following hadeeth: Abu Hurayrah said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: “All of my ummah will be forgiven except those who sin openly. It is a part of sinning openly when a man does something at night, then the following morning when Allaah has concealed his sin, he says, ‘O So and so, I did such and such last night,’ when all night his Lord has concealed him and the next morning he uncovers what Allaah had concealed.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5721; Muslim, 2990). On this basis: We advise you to repent sincerely, and if you are tested with any kind of sin, do not speak openly of it or brag about it. You should be aware of the greatness of the One against Whom you are sinning, seek forgiveness for your sin, weep for the error of your ways and adhere strictly to the path of Allaah. Beware of despairing of the mercy of Allaah. If you adhere properly to the religion of Allaah, you will have glad tidings of goodness in this world and in the Hereafter. We ask Allaah to help us and you to do that which He loves and is pleased with. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.In order to understand this issue we must note that there are two types of reward, the reward for knowledge and the reward for accompanying the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Some later members of the ummah may do deeds that are greater in reward than similar actions on the part of some of the Sahaabah because they will have no one to support and help them, and because they will be subject to a great deal of temptation, but they will not have the reward of having accompanied the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and met him. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said: The hadeeth “The righteous among them will have the reward of fifty of you” does not mean that people other than the Sahaabah are superior to the Sahaabah, because simply having more reward does not prove that one is superior. Moreover, the difference in reward is with regard to the same type of deed. But the superiority attained by one who saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cannot be matched by anyone. This is how we may interpret the ahaadeeth quoted above. Fath al-Baari, 7/7 Shaykh al-Islam (Ibn Taymiyah – may Allaah have mercy on him) said: They – meaning the later members of the ummah – may have good deeds equivalent to those of fifty men among the Sahaabah, of the deeds that they did at that time. That is because the Sahaabah had help and support in that, whereas those who come later may not have help and support. But the fact that the reward will be multiplied for them in cases where it is not multiplied for the Sahaabah does not mean that they are better than the Sahaabah or that their virtue is any greater than that of the Sahaabah. What the Sahaabah achieved in terms of faith, jihad and fighting the people of this earth by supporting the Messenger, believing what he said and obeying his teachings before his call spread, his word prevailed, the number of his supporters increased and the proof of his Prophethood became widely known, indeed when the believers were so few in number and the disbelievers and hypocrites were so many, and the believers spent their wealth for the sake of Allaah, seeking His pleasure in that situation, is something that no one can achieve the like of any more. As it says in al-Saheehayn, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do not curse the Sahaabah, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, if any one of you spent the equivalent of Mount Uhud in gold, he would not attain the level of any one of them, or even come half way.” Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 13/65, 66 Moreover, there is no virtuous deed that those who come later can do, but those who came before did something similar in a more perfect fashion. With regard to the words “They will have the reward of fifty of you because you have supporters who help you to do good and they will not have any supporters who will help them to do good,” this is correct in a case where a deed done by a single person among those who come later are like the deed done by a group of people among those who came before, so he will have the reward of fifty. But you should not imagine that one of those who come later will do deeds like those of some of the major Sahaabah such as Abu Bakr and ‘Umar, for there will never again be a Prophet like Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with whom people may do deeds like those that were done with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). With regard to the words, “My ummah is like the rain, I do not know whether the first of it is better or the last of it,” although this hadeeth is not very sound, what it means is that among those who come later there will be those who are similar to those who came before, and they will be so close that the one who tries to compare them will not know which is better, even though one of them is in fact better. This is glad tidings for those who come later, that among them will be those who are close to those who came before them, as it says in another hadeeth: “The best of my ummah are the first and the last, and between them there will be some crookedness. Would that I could see my brethren.” They said, “Are we not your brethren?” He said, “You are my companions.” This shows that precedence was given to the Sahaabah, because they alone are his companions, which is a higher status than merely being brothers.” Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 11/370, 371 It is worth pointing out that there is no basis for the phrase used in the question, “the best of generations is my generation”, although it is often used in the books of Ahl al-Sunnah. Moreover, there is a mistake with regard to its meaning. If this is what he said, then he would have said after it, “then the one that follows it.” But the wording of the hadeeth is “then those who follow them.” The wording of the saheeh hadeeth is: “The best of mankind/people is my generation” and “The best of my ummah is my generation.” And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The basic principle is that interest-based transactions are haraam and it is not permissible to engage in them. This includes the conditions mentioned in the contracts for credit cards. In some countries they rely a great deal on these credit cards, and you can hardly find anyone who does not use them. We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen: Credit cards include conditions based on riba (interest/usury) if you delay payments, they charge an extra penalty. But in the place where I live in America, I cannot rent a car or a shop or use many other services unless I have a credit card. If I do not use a credit card, I will suffer unbearable hardship. If I commit myself to make the payments within a certain time limit, so that I do not have to pay the interest charges, will this allow me to have a credit card and thus relieve some of the hardship I am facing? The shaykh, may Allaah preserve him, answered as follows: If the hardship he is facing is certain, and the likelihood that he will delay payments is remote, then I hope there is nothing wrong with him having the credit card. Question: Do the conditions relating to interest make a transaction invalid or not? Answer: If a contract contains an invalid condition, this does not invalidate the entire contract, for a number of reasons: (1) necessity, (2) because it does not really affect anything. The man thinks that he is going to make the payments before interest is due. Because this is more likely than the condition of having to pay interest, and because it is necessary which is the main point I hope that there is nothing wrong with it. We have a definite matter necessity and a matter which is not necessarily going to happen which is delay in payment and the matter that is definite takes precedence over something which may not even happen.

      "Praise be to Allah.With regard to the idea that a person’s prayer is invalidated if a woman, donkey or black dog passes in front of him, this is correct. It was reported from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Saamit that Abu Dharr said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘If any one of you stands up to pray, then he has a sutrah [an item placed in front of a praying person as a “screen”] if he has something the height of the back of a saddle in front of him. If he does not have something the height of the back of a saddle in front of him, then his prayer is invalidated if a donkey or a woman or a black dog passes in front of him.’” I [‘Abd-Allaah] asked, “O Abu Dharr, what is the difference between a black dog and a red or yellow dog?” He said, “O son of my brother, I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) the same question, and he said, ‘The black dog is a shaytaan (devil).’” (Narrated by Muslim, 510). The height of the back of a saddle is one cubit or 2/3 of a cubit. But this ruling applies only when one of these three pass in front of the imaam or a person who is praying on his own, not when they pass between the rows of a congregation praying behind the imaam during prayer in jamaa’ah, as the sister who asked the question thinks. The evidence for that is the report in which ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Abbaas said: “I came along riding on a female donkey one day when I had just reached the age of puberty. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was leading the people in prayer in Mina, without any kind of wall in front of him. I passed in front of part of the row, then I got down and sent the donkey to graze, and joined the row, and no one rebuked me for that.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 472; Muslim, 504) Imaam al-Bukhaari gave this hadeeth the heading of “Sutrat al-Imaam sutrat man khalfahu (the sutrah of the imaam is the sutrah of those behind him).” This hadeeth clearly proves our point, which is that the person who is praying behind the imaam does not have to have a sutrah, and it does not matter what passes in front of him, especially since Ibn ‘Abbaas passed in front of them with his donkey, which is one of the things which invalidates prayer if it passes in front of the imaam or a person who is praying on his own. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr said: This hadeeth – i.e., the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari (487) and Muslim (505) from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri which says “If any one of you is praying, he should not let anyone pass in front of him. Let him push him away as much as he can, and if he insists then let him fight him, for he is nothing but a shaytaan (devil)” – indicates that it is makrooh to pass in front of a person who is praying if he is praying on his own and without a sutrah. The same ruling applies to the imaam if he is praying without a sutrah. But with regard to the person who is praying behind the imaam, it does not matter what passes in front of him, just as it does not matter what passes in front of the imaam or person praying alone if it passes behind the sutrah. The sutrah of the imaam is also the sutrah of those who are praying behind him. We say this concerning the imaam and the person who prays alone, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “If any one of you is praying…” According to the scholars, this means praying on his own, because of the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas. Hence we say that the person who is praying behind the imaam does not have to push away the person who passes in front of him, because Ibn ‘Abbaas said:“I came along riding on a female donkey one day when I had just reached the age of puberty. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was leading the people in prayer in Mina, without any kind of wall in front of him. I passed in front of part of the row, then I got down and sent the donkey to graze, and joined the row, and no one rebuked me for that.” (al-Tamheed, 4/187) On this basis, the sister who asked this question, and other people, do not have to push away anyone who passes in front of them if they are praying behind the imaam, and there is no sin on the person who passes in front of the row if this is donefor a reason. Pushing a person away and preventing them from passing in front is to be done by the imaam or the person who is praying alone, if a person wants to pass between him and his sutrah. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.What you have said in your question about it being haraam (unlawful)for a Muslim woman to marry a non-Muslim man is correct, and there is no doubt concerning that. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And give not (your daughters) in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon (polytheists)till they believe [al-Baqarah 2:221] Al-Qurtubi said: And give not (your daughters) in marriage means, do not give Muslim women in marriage to Mushrik (pagan)men. The ummah (Muslim nation)is agreed that a Mushrik should not marry a Muslim woman because this is like putting Islam in an inferior position. (Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 3/72). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them [al-Mumtahanah 60:10] Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Chapter: when a mushrik or Christian woman who is married to a dhimmi (non-Muslim living under Muslim rule) or a harbi (non-Muslim belonging to a people who are hostile towards Islam) becomes Muslim. Abd al-Waarith said, narrating from Khaalid from Ikrimah from Ibn Abbaas: if a Christian woman becomes Muslim shortly before her husband, she is forbidden for him Mujaahid said: if he becomes Muslim during the iddah [waiting period following divorce], then he may (re)marry her. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): They are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them [al-Mumtahanah 60:10]. Al-Hasan and Qutaadah said concerning two Magians who became Muslim that their marriage was still valid. If one of them had become Muslim and the other had refused, the woman would have been divorced and he would no longer have any rights over her. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari. See al-Fath, 9/421). Examples of such women include: Zaynab, the daughter of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). She was married to Abul-Aas ibn al-Rabee during the Jaahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) but when she became Muslim, their marriage was annulled, and she went and stayed with her father (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When her husband became Muslim, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent her back to him. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1143; Abu Dawood, 2240; Ibn Maajah, 2009; classed as saheeh by Imaam Ahmad, 1789. Al-Tirmidhi said, there is nothing wrong with its isnaad). The correct view is that the husband can go back to her with no need to renew the marriage contract. If the woman is still in her iddah (waiting period), he has more right (than anyone else) to marry her. If her iddah has ended, she is free to choose whether to go back to him or not. Al-Tirmidhi said: On the basis of this hadeeth, the scholars said that if a woman becomes Muslim before her husband, then her husband becomes Muslim whilst she is still in her iddah, then the husband has more right to her whilst she is still in her iddah. This is the view of Maalik ibn Anas, al-Oozaai, al-Shaafai, Ahmad and Ishaaq. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Hadeeth 1142). Ibn Abd al-Barr said: There is no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact that if a non-Muslim woman becomes Muslim then her iddah ends, her husband has no rights concerning her if he has not become Muslim during her iddah. (Al-Tamheed, 12/23). Ibn al-Qayyim said: But what the ruling of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicates is that the marriage comes to a halt. If he becomes Muslim before the end of her iddah, then she is (still) his wife, but if her iddah ends, then she may marry whomever she wants. If she likes, she can wait for him, and if he becomes Muslim she is his wife and there is no need to renew the marriage contract. (Zaad al-Maaad, 5/137, 138) Al-Qurtubi said: Talhah ibn Ubayd-Allaah was married to Arwaa bint Rabeeah ibn al-Haarith ibn Abd al-Muttalib. They were separated by Islam, then in Islam Khaalid ibn Saeed ibn al-Aas married her. She was one of the [Muslim] wives of the non-Muslims who fled to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kept her in Madinah and married her to Khaalid. (Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 18/65, 66) It was reported that Anas said: Abu Talhah married Umm Sulaym and the mahr (dowry)between them was Islam. Umm Sulaym became Muslim before Abu Talhah. He proposed marriage to her and she said, I have become Muslim. If you become Muslim I will marry you. So he became Muslim and that was the mahr between them. (Narrated by al-Nasaai, 3340) The daughter of al-Waleed ibn al-Magheerah, the wife of Safwaan ibn Umayyah, became Muslim before him, and the marriage was annulled. Then he became Muslim later on, and she went back to him. It was narrated by Maalik in al-Muwatta, 1132. Ibn Abd al-Barr said: I do not know of any unbroken saheeh isnaad for this hadeeth, but it is famous and well known to the scholars of seerah, Ibn Shihaab, the leader of the scholars of seerah, and al-Shubi. The fame of this hadeeth is stronger than its isnaad in sha Allaah. (al-Tamheed, 12/19) Umm Hakeem bint al-Haarith ibn Hishaam, the wife of Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl. Her marriage was annulled, then he became Muslim during her iddah, so she went back to her husband. (Narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah in al-Musannaf, 4/107) And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This question was answered for us by Shaykh ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Munayyi’, who said: “One of the basic principles of sharee’ah is the hadeeth of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who said: ‘There should be neither harming nor reciprocating harm.’ Part of this principle is that the Muslim is not permitted to harm himself, which includes not using contaminated water for doing wudoo’. So it is forbidden to do wudoo’ using contaminated water, but if a person does do wudoo’ using such water his wudoo’ is still valid, because it is not naajis (ritually impure), but his action is haraam because he is harming himself.

      "Praise be to Allah.Obedience to a created being becomes shirk in situations such as obeying that person in matters where what is forbidden is deemed to be allowed, and vice versa, or when that person issues rules and regulations, or laws, that go against the laws of Allaah, and the follower believes that these laws are more complete and better than the laws of Allaah, or as good as His laws, or that the laws of Allaah are better but it is permissible to follow these man-made laws. The evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their Lords besides Allaah (by obeying then in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allaah)…” [al-Tawbah 9:31]. ‘Adiyy ibn Haatim said: “O Messenger of Allaah, we do not worship them.” [He was a Christian who became a Muslim - Translator]. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Do they not allow you that which Allaah has forbidden and forbid what Allaah has allowed?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “This is a kind of worship.” The Christians’ obedience of their priests in sin and in accepting what they say about what is lawful or unlawful is a form of worshipping something other than Allaah, which is a kind of shirk akbar (major shirk), that contradicts Tawheed (true monotheism). With regard to your question, if the person who obeys his parents in sin believes that it is in fact a sin, but he does what he does because of his own desires or because he is afraid of his parents’ punishment, but it is not the matter of being forced to do so, then he is a sinner who has gone against the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), There is no obedience to a created being if it involves disobedience of the Creator” (reported by Ahmad, 1041; a saheeh hadeeth) – but he is not considered to be guilty of shirk akbar. But if the son believes that what his parents say overrules what Allaah says about halaal and haraam, then he is guilty of shirk akbar. The Muslim has to strive against himself to bring his desires in line with what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught, and so that he gives precedence to obeying Allaah and His Messenger over obeying anyone else, and so that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than anyone else. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father, and all the people.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 63).

      "Contents Related Is a pregnant woman obliged to fast? Cases of fasting during pregnancy Praise be to Allah.Is a pregnant woman obliged to fast? A pregnant Muslim woman is obliged to fast , just like anyone else, unless she fears for herself or for her baby, in which case it is permissible for her not to fast. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said, concerning the verse (interpretation of the meaning): “And as for those who can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man), they have (a choice either to fast or) to feed a miskeen (poor person) (for every day).” [al-Baqarah 2:184] “This was a concession granted to old men and old women who are able to fast but it is difficult, so they are allowed not to fast, and must feed one poor person for each day ; and for those who are sick or pregnant, if they fear for their children, they are allowed not to fast and must feed (one poor person for each day).” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 2317; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Irwa al-Ghalil, 4/25, 18) Cases of fasting during pregnancy It should be noted that it may be permissible, obligatory or haram for a pregnant woman not to fast. It is permissible for her not to fast if fasting is too difficult for her, but will not harm her. It is obligatory for her (not to fast) if fasting will cause harm to her or her baby. It is haraam for her (not to fast) if no hardship results from her fasting. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin (may Allah have mercy on him) said: In the case of a pregnant woman, one of two scenarios must apply: She is strong and active, and fasting does not cause any hardship to her or affect her baby. This woman is obliged to fast, because she has no excuse for not fasting. When a woman is not able to fast, because the pregnancy is too difficult for her, or because she is physically weak, or for some other reason. In this case she should break the fast, especially if it will cause harm to her baby – in which case she is obliged not to fast. (Fatawa al-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 1/487) Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “Pregnant and breastfeeding women come under the same ruling as those who are sick. If fasting is too difficult for them, it is prescribed for them to break the fast, and they have to make up missed fasts when they are able to do so, just as in the case of one who is sick. Some of the scholars were of the view that it is sufficient for them to feed one poor person for each day missed, but this is a weak view. The correct view is that they have to make up the missed days, as is the case of those who were sick and for travelers, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number (should be made up) from other days.” [al-Baqarah 2:184] This is also indicated by the hadith of Anas ibn Malik al-Ka’bi, according to which the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: ‘Allah has exempted the traveler from the obligation of fasting and has reduced the prayer by half for him, and has exempted pregnant and breastfeeding women from the obligation of fasting.” (Narrated by the five) (Tuhfat al-Ikhwan bi Ajwibah Muhimmah Tata’allaq bi Arkan al-Islam, p. 171) For more, please see these answers: 128804 and 50762 .

And wheresoever you people are, turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction” [al-Baqarah 2:144]. You could ask the crew to find out which direction the Qiblah is in, and make the most of the opportunity, once the plane has reached its altitude and settled in its course, to pray standing facing the Qiblah. If that is not possible, and you can delay the prayer until the plane lands, without delaying it beyond the allotted time, so that you can pray standing and facing the Qiblah on the ground, then you can do that. If this is not possible because you fear that the time for that prayer will end, then pray as best you can in the plane, and your prayer will be valid.

      "Contents Related Who are Yajuj and Majuj? Wall of Dhu’l-Qarnayn: Real or imaginary? Hadiths about Yajuj and Majuj Praise be to Allah.Who are Yajuj and Majuj? There is no doubt that Yajuj and Majuj are two huge nations of the sons of Adam. Anyone who reads the story of Dhu’l-Qarnayn and how he dealt with this nation in Surat al-Kahf will know for sure that they exist and that the barrier which was built is not metaphorical or imaginary, but is a physical barrier built of iron and melted copper. The basic principle is that we should take this Quranic text as it is, without resorting to any kind of misinterpretation or trying to twist the intended meaning. Wall of Dhu’l-Qarnayn: Real or imaginary? The Quran has told us how the barrier was built and what materials were used, so it is not right to say that it is a metaphorical or imaginary barrier. In Surat al-Kahf, Allah has told us the story of the Muslim king and the great leader Dhu’l-Qarnayn (may Allah have mercy on him): “Until, when he reached between two mountains, he found, before (near) them, a people who scarcely understood a word. They said, ‘O Dhu’l-Qarnayn! Verily! Yajuj and Majuj are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them?’ He said: ‘That (wealth, authority and power) in which my Lord has established me is better (than your tribute). So help me with strength (of men), I will erect between you and them a barrier. Give me pieces (blocks) of iron,’ then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs, he said, ‘Blow,’ till when he had made it (red as) fire, he said, ‘Bring me molten copper to pour over it.’ So they [Yajuj and Majuj ] were made powerless to scale it or dig through it. (Dhu’l-Qarnayn) said: ‘This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the Promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down to the ground. And the Promise of my Lord is ever true.’” [al-Kahf 18:93-98] Hadiths about Yajuj and Majuj What indicates that these nations exist at present, and indeed are attempting on a daily basis to get out and attack people, is the hadith reported by Ibn Majah with a sahih isnad from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: “The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Yajuj and Majuj are digging every day until they can almost see sunlight, then the one who is in charge of them says, “Go back, we will dig again tomorrow.” Then Allah restores (the barrier) and makes it stronger than it was. (This will continue) until the appointed time. When Allah wishes to send them against the people, they will dig until they can almost see sunlight, then the one who is in charge of them will say, “Go back, we will dig again tomorrow, in sha Allah.” This time he will say “in sha Allah”, so when they come back (the next day), they will find it as they left it, so they will dig their way out and emerge to attack the people. They will dry up water (by drinking it, because of their great numbers), and the people will seek to protect themselves from them in their fortresses. They will fire their arrows into the sky, and the arrows will come back down covered in blood (as a test for them), and they will say, “We have defeated the people of the earth and have gained the upper hand over the people of heaven.” Then Allah will send worms on the napes of their necks, which will kill them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “By the One in Whose hand is my soul, the beasts of the earth will grow fat from their flesh.” (Sahih Ibn Majah, 3298) Umm Habibah bint Abi Sufyan reported from Zaynab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) entered upon her in an agitated state and said, “La ilaha ill-Allah, woe to the Arabs from an evil that has approached! Today a hole like this has been opened in the barrier of Yajuj and Majuj ,” and he made a circle with his thumb and forefinger. Zaynab bint Jahsh said: “I said, ‘O Messenger of Allah, will we be destroyed even though there are righteous people among us?’ He said, ‘Yes, if evil becomes overwhelming.’” (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3097).

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to combine all five prayers at one time, even if it is because of travelling. Indeed, it is not permissible to combine three prayers, so it is not correct to combine Maghrib, ‘Isha’ and Fajr, for example. What is permitted is to combine Zuhr and ‘Asr, and Maghrib and ‘Isha’, but Fajr cannot be combined with any other prayer. The reason for this is that each one of the five prayers has its appointed time which is clearly defined, and which should be adhered to as it says in the Qur’aan: “… Verily, the prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.”[al-Nisa’ 4:103] This is also indicated by the hadeeth in which Jibreel (peace be upon him) defined the times of each prayer and explained them to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It was not reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) combined all five prayers, only that he combined Zuhr and ‘Asr, and Maghrib and ‘Isha’. Acts of worship are based on reports, and combining prayers is an issue that has to do with acts of worship, so we should adhere to what it says in the texts and not try to take the matter any further. Ibn Daqeeq al-‘Eed reported scholarly consensus on this issue, as did Ibn Hubayrah. Ibn Hajar al-Haythami said: “ ‘Asr should not be combined with Maghrib, nor ‘Isha’ with Subh (Fajr), ‘Asr can only be combined with Zuhr, in accordance with what was reported.” Al-Raafi’i (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “It is not permitted to combine Salaat al-Subh with any other prayer, or to combine ‘Asr and Maghrib, because no such thing was reported from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him).” (Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar agreed with him in Talkhees al-Habeer, 4/427).

      "Related Praise be to Allah.Some people have started to claim that the Sunnah is not a source of legislation. They call themselves al-Quraaniyyeen and say that we have the Quraan, so we take as halaal whatever it allows and take as haraam whatever it forbids. The Sunnah, according to their claims, is full of fabricated ahaadeeth falsely attributed to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). They are the successors of other people about whom the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us. Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Haakim reported with a saheeh isnaad from al-Miqdaam that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Soon there will be a time when a man will be reclining on his couch, narrating a hadeeth from me, and he will say, Between us and you is the Book of Allaah: what it says is halaal, we take as halaal, and what it says is haraam, we take as haraam. But listen! Whatever the Messenger of Allaah forbids is like what Allaah forbids. (Al-Fath al-Kabeer, 3/438. Al-Tirmidhi reported it with different wording, and said that it is hasan saheeh. Sunan al-Tirmidhi bi Sharh Ibn al-Arabi, al-Saawi edn., 10/132). The name al-Quraaniyyeen does not befit these people, because the Quraan tells us, in almost one hundred aayahs, to obey the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Obedience to the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is considered in the Quraan to be a part of obedience to Allaah, may He be glorified. He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent you (O Muhammad) as a watcher over them. [al-Nisa 4:80 interpretation of the meaning]. The Quraan, which they claim to follow, denies the faith of the one who refuses to obey the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and does not accept his ruling: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission. [al-Nisa 4:65 interpretation of the meaning] Their suggestion that the Sunnah is contaminated with fabricated ahaadeeth is not valid, because the scholars of this ummah took the utmost care to purify the Sunnah from all alien elements. If they had any doubts about the truthfulness of any narrator, or there was the slightest possibility that he could have forgotten something, this would be sufficient grounds for rejecting a hadeeth. Even the enemies of this ummah have stated that no other nation has paid so much attention to examining its reports and their narrators, especially in the case of reports narrated from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). For it to be obligatory to follow a hadeeth, it is sufficient for it to be known that it is a saheeh (authentic, sound) hadeeth narrated from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was content to convey his message by sending just one of his Companions, which proves that the hadeeth reported by one trustworthy person must be followed. Moreover, we would ask these people: where are the aayaat which tell us how to pray, or which tell us that the obligatory prayers are five times daily, or which tell us about the nisaab on various kinds of wealth for the purpose of zakaah, or about the details of the rituals of Hajj, and other rulings which we can only know from the Sunnah?

      "Praise be to Allah.Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to encourage us to pray at night in Ramadaan, without making it obligatory. Then he said, ‘Whoever prays at night in Ramadaan out of faith and the hope of reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven.’ When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died, this is how things were (i.e., Taraaweeh was not prayed in congregation), and this is how they remained during the khilaafah of Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him), until the beginning of the khilaafah of ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him).” ‘Amr ibn Murrah al-Juhani said: “A man from Qudaa’ah came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah! What do you think if I testify that there is no god except Allaah, and that you, Muhammad, are His Messenger, and I pray the five daily prayers, and fast in the month (of Ramadaan), and pray at night in Ramadaan, and pay zakaah?’ The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever dies on that will be among the siddeeqeen (those who tell the truth) and the martyrs.’” Laylat al-Qadr and its timing 2 – The best of its nights is Laylat al-Qadr, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays at night during Laylat al-Qadr and manages to “catch” it out of faith and the hope of reward, all his previous sins will be forgiven.” 3 – According to the most correct opinion, it is the twenty-seventh night of Ramadaan. Most of the ahaadeeth state this, such as the hadeeth of Zurr ibn Hubaysh, who said: “I heard Ubayy ibn Ka’b saying – and it was said to him that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn Mas’ood said: ‘Whoever follows the Sunnah will ‘catch’ Laylat al-Qadr!’ – Ubayy (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: ‘May Allaah have mercy on him, he did not want people to take it for granted and only stay up to pray on one night. By the One besides Whom there is no other god, it is in Ramadaan – he was swearing without a doubt – and by Allaah, I do know which night it is. It is the night in which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded us to pray (qiyaam). It is the night the morning of which is the twenty seventh, and the sign of it is that the sun rises on that morning white and without rays.’” In another report, this was attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). (Reported by Muslim and others). Praying qiyaam in congregation It is allowed to pray qiyaam in congregation, indeed it is better than praying individually, because this is what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did himself and explained its virtues. Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “We fasted Ramadaan with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and he did not lead us in qiyaam at all until there were only seven days left, when he led us in prayer until a third of the night had passed. When there were six days left, he did not lead us in qiyaam. When there were five days left, he led us in prayer until half the night had passed. I said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, I wish that you had continued until the end of the night.’ He said, ‘If a man prays with the imaam until he finishes, it will be counted as if he prayed the whole night.’ When there were four nights left, he did not lead us in qiyaam. When there were three nights left, he brought together his family, his wives and the people, and led us in qiyaam until we were afraid that we would miss al-falaah. I asked, ‘What is al-falaah?’ he said, ‘Suhoor. Then he did not lead us in qiyaam for the rest of the month.’” (Saheeh hadeeth reported by the authors of Sunan). The reason why the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not continually lead the people in praying qiyaam in congregation 5 - The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not lead them in qiyaam for the rest of the month because he feared that it would then become obligatory, and they would not be able to do it, as is stated in the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah reported in al-Saheehayn and elsewhere. Following the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), that fear was no longer a factor, because Allaah had completed the religion. The reason for not praying qiyaam in congregation during Ramadaan no longer applied, and the previous ruling, that congregational prayer is something prescribed in Islam, remained in effect. So ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) revived the practice, as is recorded in Saheeh al-Bukhaari and elsewhere. Women can pray qiyaam in congregation Women can attend the prayers too, as is stated in the hadeeth of Abu Dharr referred to above. Indeed, it is permissible to appoint an imaam just for them, apart from the imaam of the men. It was proven that when ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) gathered the people to pray qiyaam, he appointed Ubayy ibn Ka’b to lead the men and Sulaymaan ibn Abi Hathmah to lead the women. ‘Arfajah al-Thaqafi said: “ ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to command the people to pray during the night in Ramadaan, and he would appoint an imaam for the men and an imaam for the women. I was the imaam for the women.” I say: this is fine in my view so long as the mosque is big enough so that they will not disturb one another. Number of rak’ahs of qiyaam 7 – The number of rak’ahs is eleven, and it is preferable in our opinion not to exceed this number, following the practice of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because he never did more than that in his life. ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) was asked about how he prayed in Ramadaan. She said, “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) never prayed more than eleven rak’ahs (of qiyaam), whether during Ramadaan or any other time. He would pray four, and don’t ask me how beautiful or how long they were. Then he would pray four, and don’t ask me how beautiful or how long they were. Then he would pray three.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others). 8- A person may do less than that, even if it is only one rak’ah of witr, because of the evidence that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did this and spoke about it. With regard to him doing it: ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) was asked how many rak’ahs the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray in witr? She said, “He used to pray four and three, or six and three, or ten and three. He never used to pray less than seven, or more than thirteen.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, Ahmad and others). With regard to him speaking about it, he said: “Witr is true, so whoever wishes can pray five, and whoever wishes can pray three, and whoever wishes can pray one.” Reciting Qur’aan in qiyaam 9 – As regards reciting from the Qur’aan during qiyaam, whether in Ramadaan or at other times, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not set a limit or state what was too much or too little. His recitation used to vary, sometimes it would be long, at other times short. Sometimes in every rak’ah he would recite the equivalent of ‘Yaa ayyuha’l-muzammil, which is twenty aayaat; sometimes he would recite the equivalent of fifty aayaat. He used to say, “Whoever prays at night and reads one hundred aayaat will not be recorded as one of the negligent.” According to another hadeeth: “…and reads two hundred aayaat, will be recorded as one of the devout and sincere believers.” When he was sick, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited the seven long soorahs in his night prayers, i.e., al-Baqarah, Aal ‘Imraan, al-Nisaa’, al-Maa’idah, al-An’aam, al-A’raaf and al-Tawbah. In the account of Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamaan praying behind the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), in one rak’ah he recited al-Baqarah, al-Nisa’ and Aal ‘Imraan, and he recited them in a slow and measured tone. It is proven with the soundest (most saheeh) of isnaads that when ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) appointed Ubayy ibn Ka’b to lead the people in praying eleven rak’ahs in Ramadaan, Ubayy used to recite aayaat by the hundreds, so that the people behind him would be leaning on sticks because the prayers were so long, and they did not finish until just before Fajr. It is also reported in a saheeh account that ‘Umar called the readers during Ramadaan, and told the fastest of them to recite thirty aayaat, the moderate ones to recite twenty-five aayaat, and the slowest ones to recite twenty aayaat. However, is a person is praying qiyaam by himself, he can make it as long as he wishes; if others agree with the imaam, he may also make it as long as he wishes. The longer it is, the better, but a person should not go to extremes and spend the whole night in qiyaam, except on rare occasions, following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) who said: “The best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad.” If a person is praying as an imaam, he should make it only as long as is easy for the people behind him, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If any of you leads the people in prayer, let him make it short, because among them are the young and the old, the weak, and those who have pressing needs. But if he is praying alone, let him make it as long as he likes.” The timing of qiyaam 10 – The time for praying qiyaam is from after ‘Isha until Fajr, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Allaah has added one more prayer for you, which is witr, so pray it between Salaat al-‘Isha’ and Salaat al-Fajr.” 11 – Praying at the end of the night is better, for those who can manage it, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever is afraid that he will not get up at the end of the night, let him pray witr at the beginning of the night, but whoever feels that he will be able to get up at the end of the night, let him pray witr at the end of the night, for prayer at the end of the night is witnessed [by the angels???], and that is better.” 12 – If it is the matter of choosing between praying in congregation at the beginning of the night and praying alone at the end of the night, it is preferable to pray with the jamaa’ah, because that is counted as if one had prayed the whole night through. This is what the Sahaabah did at the time of ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him). ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Abd al-Qaari said: “I went out with ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab to the mosque one night during Ramadaan, and saw the people scattered throughout the mosque, some praying individually, and some praying in small groups. He said, ‘By Allaah, I think that if I gathered all of them behind one reader it would be better.’ So he resolved to do that, and he gathered them behind Ubayy ibn Ka’b. Then I went with him on another night, and the people were all praying behind their reader, and ‘Umar said, ‘What a good innovation this is. What they sleep and miss – meaning the latter part of the night – is better than what they are doing,’ – the people used to pray qiyaam at the beginning of the night.” Zayd ibn Wahb said: “‘Abd-Allaah used to lead us in prayer in Ramadaan, and he used to finish at night.” 13 – The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade praying witr as three rak’ahs, and explained this by saying: “Do not make it resemble Salaat al-Maghrib.” Therefore the person who wants to pray three rak’ahs for witr must find a way to make it different (from Maghrib). There are two ways he can do this: either by giving salaam after the first two rak’ahs, which is the best way; or by not sitting after the first two rak’ahs (i.e., praying three rak’ahs non-stop). And Allaah knows best. Recitation during three rak’ahs of witr 14 – It is Sunnah to recite Sabbih bi ismi Rabbika al-‘A’laa in the first rak’ah, Qul Yaa ayyuha’l-Kaafiroon in the second rak’ah, and Qul Huwa Allaahu ahad in the third rak’ah. Sometimes Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi’l-Falaq and Qul a’oodhu bi Rabbi’l-Naas may be added as well. It was reported in a saheeh report that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) once recited one hundred aayaat of Soorat al-Nisa’ in one rak’ah of witr. Du’aa’ al-Qunoot 15 – A person may also humble himself before Allaah by reciting the du’aa’ which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught to his grandson al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him), which is: “Allaahumma’hdinee fiman hadayta wa ‘aafinee fiman ‘aafayta wa tawallanee fiman tawallayta wa baarik lee fimaa a’tayta wa qinee sharra maa qadayt, fa innaka taqdee wa laa yuqdaa ‘alayk. Wa innahu laa yadhillu man waalayta wa laa ya’izzu man ‘aadayt. Tabaarakta Rabbanaa wa ta’aalayt. Laa majaa minka illa ilayk (O Allaah, guide me along with those whom You have guided, pardon me along with those whom You have pardoned, be an ally to me along with those whom You are an ally to, and bless for me that which You have bestowed. Protect me from the evil You have decreed for verily You decree and none can decree over You. For surety, he whom You show allegiance to is never abased and he whom You take an enemy is never honored and mighty. O our Lord, Blessed and Exalted are You. There is no refuge from You except with You).” Sometimes one may send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and there is nothing wrong with adding other du’aa’s that are known from the Sunnah. 16 – There is nothing wrong with reciting Qunoot after rukoo’, or with adding curses against the kuffaar, sending blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or praying for the Muslims in the second half of Ramadaan, because it is proven that the imaam used to do this at the time of ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him). At the end of the hadeeth of ‘Abd al-Rahmaan ibn ‘Ubayd al-Qaari mentioned above, it says: “… They used to curse the kuffaar in the middle, saying, ‘Allaahumma qaatil al-kafarata alladheena yasuddoona ‘an sabeelik wa yukadhdhiboona rusulak wa laa yu’minoona bi wa’dik. Wa khaalif bayna kalimatihim wa alqi fi quloobihim al-ru’b wa alqi ‘alayhim rijzaka wa ‘adhaabak ilaah al-haqq (O Allaah, destroy the kuffaar who are trying to prevent people from following Your path, who deny Your Messengers and who do not believe in Your promise (the Day of Judgement). Make them disunited, fill their hearts with terror and send Your wrath and punishment against them, O God of Truth).” Then he would send blessings on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and pray for good for the Muslims as much as he could, and seek forgiveness for the believers. After he had finished cursing the kuffaar, sending blessings on the Prophet, seeking forgiveness for the believing men and women and asking for his own needs, he would say: “Allaahumma iyyaaka na’bud wa laka nusalli wa najud, wa ilayka nas’aa wa nahfud, wa narju rahmataka rabbanaa wa nakhaafu ‘adhaabak al-jadd. Inna ‘adhaabaka liman ‘aadayta mulhaq (O Allaah, You do we worship, to You do we pray and prostrate, for Your sake we strive and toil. We place our hope in Your Mercy, O our Lord, and we fear Your mighty punishment, for Your punishment will certainly overtake the one whom You have taken as an enemy.” Then he would say “Allaahu akbar” and go down in sujood. What should be said at the end of witr 17 – It is Sunnah to say at the end of witr (before or after the salaam): “Allaahumma innee a’oodhu bi ridaaka min sakhatika wa bi mu’aafaatika min ‘aqoobatika, wa a’oodhu bika minka. La uhsee thanaa’an ‘alayka, anta kamaa athnayta ‘ala nafsik (O Allaah, I seek refuge in Your good pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your protection from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from You. I cannot praise You enough, and You are as You have praised Yourself.” 18 – When he gave salaam at the end of witr, he said: “Subhaan il-Malik il-Quddoos, subhaan il-Malik il-Quddoos, subhaan il-Malik il-Quddoos (Glory be to the Sovereign, the Most Holy), elongating the syllables, and raising his voice the third time. Two rak’ahs after witr 19 – A person may pray two rak’ahs after witr if he wishes, because it is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did this. Indeed, he said, “This travelling is exhausting and difficult, so after any one of you prays witr, let him pray two rak’ahs. If he wakes up, this is fine, otherwise these two rak’ahs will be counted for him. 20 – It is Sunnah to recite Idha zulzilat al-ard and Qul yaa ayyuha’l-kaafiroon in these two rak’ahs.\n",

He will be considered to have prayed with the imaam until he finished, because he stayed with him until he finished, and added another rakah for a shar'i reason, which was so that he could pray witr later in the night. There is nothing wrong with this, and it does not mean that he did not stay with the imaam until he finished, but he did not finish with him he delayed it a little longer.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to change the Arabic numerals which are currently in use and replace them with the numerals used in the western world, for the following reasons: Firstly: there is no proof of what the advocates of change say about the numerals used in the West being Arabic numerals. What is known is something other than that, as is proven by reality and the fact that for centuries the current numerals were used in different circumstances and different fields, which makes them Arabic. There are words in the Arabic language which were not originally Arabic, but they became part of the Arabic language through usage, to the extent that some of these words are to be found in the Qur’aan; these words are described as Arabized. Secondly: this idea has bad consequences and harmful effects, because it is a step towards the gradual Westernization of Islamic societies. Thirdly: it paves the way for changing the Arabic script and using Latin script instead of Arabic, even in the long run. Fourthly: it is an aspect of imitating the West and approving of its ways. Fifthly: all the copies of the Qur’aan (masaahif), books of Tafseer, Arabic dictionaries and other books use the current Arabic numerals in numbering their pages etc., and in referring to other sources. All these books represent a vast store of knowledge. If the foreign numerals are used instead, this will make it very difficult for the coming generation to access this vast store of knowledge. Sixthly: It is not necessary to follow certain Arab countries which are accustomed to using these European numerals. Many of these countries have also abolished something even more important, which is ruling according to the whole sharee’ah of Allaah, which is the source of honour, power and happiness in this world and the next, so what they (those countries) have done is nothing to go by.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was to do a lot of different kinds of worship during Ramadaan. Jibreel used to review the Qur’aan with him at night, and when Jibreel met with him, he was more generous in charity than the blowing wind. He was the most generous of people, and he was at his most generous in Ramadaan. At this time he used to give more in charity and treat people even more kindly; he would read more Qur’aan, pray more, recite more dhikr, and spend time in I’tikaaf (retreat). This is the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in this aspect of this holy month. As to whether it is better to read Qur’aan or to pray voluntary prayers, this depends on people’s circumstances, and the true evaluation of this is up to Allaah, because He knows all things. (From al-Jawaab al-Saheeh min Ahkaam Salaat al-Layl wa’l-Taraaweeh, by Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz, p. 45). A specific action may be better in the case of any given individual, and another may be better for another individual, according to the degree to which a particular action brings a person closer to Allaah. Some people may be influenced more by naafil prayers and may focus on them and do them properly, which will bring them closer to Allaah than other deeds might, so in their case those deeds are better. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is better to stay with the imaam until he finishes, even if he is doing more than eleven rakahs, because it is permissible to do the extra rakahs, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever prays qiyaam with the imaam until he finishes, Allaah will record it as if he prayed the whole night (reported by al-Nisaa'i and others. Sunan al-Nisaa'i, Baab Qiyaam Shahr Ramadaan), and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Prayer at night should be two by two (rakahs), and when dawn approaches, pray one for witr. (Reported by the seven; this version reported by al-Nisaa'i). There is no doubt that adhering to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is better and brings more reward, so long as it is done properly and without haste, but if it is the matter of a choice between leaving the imaam because of the number of rakahs or going along with the extra that he does, it is better to go along with him, because of the ahaadeeth referred to above. At the same time, you should advise the imaam to follow the Sunnah.\n",

      "Contents Related Is tarawih compulsory for females? Praise be to Allah.Is tarawih compulsory for females? Tarawih prayer is not obligatory for women, and it is still better for them to perform the Night Prayer at home. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila'l-masjid: Bab al-tashdid fi dhalik. See also Sahih al-Jami', no. 7458) Whenever a woman prays in a place that is more private and more hidden, that is better for her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: \"A woman's prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard , and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house.\" (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ila'l-masjid. See also Sahih al-Jami', no. 3833) Umm Humayd, the wife of Abu Humayd al-Sa'idi reported that she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) and said: \"O Messenger of Allah, I love to pray with you.\" He said: \"I know that you love to pray with me, but praying in your house is better for you than praying in your courtyard, and praying in your courtyard is better for you than praying in the mosque of your people, and praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than praying in my mosque.\" So she ordered that a prayer-place be built for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she always prayed there until she died. (Reported by Imam Ahmad; the men of its isnad are trustworthy. ) But the fact that praying at home is preferable does not mean that women are not permitted to go to the mosque, as is clear from the following hadith: `Abdullah ibn `Umar said: \"I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) say: 'Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque if they ask your permission.'\" Bilal ibn `Abdullah said, \"By Allah, we will prevent them.\" (Ibn `Umar) turned to him and told him off in an unprecedented fashion, saying: \"I tell you what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, and you say 'By Allah, we will prevent them'!!\" (Muslim, 667) Conditions of women going out to the mosques But there are conditions attached to the permission for women to go to the mosque , as follows: She should wear complete hijab. She should not go out wearing perfume. She should have the permission of her husband. Her going out should not involve any other kind of prohibited acts, such as being alone in a car with a non-mahram driver. If a woman does something wrong like that, her husband or guardian has the right to stop her; in fact it is his duty to do so. I asked our Shaykh, 'Abd al-'Aziz, about Tarawih prayer in particular, and whether it is better for a woman to perform this prayer in the mosque . He replied in the negative and said that the hadiths that state that it is preferable for a woman to pray in her house apply to all prayers, and this includes Tarawih as well as others.

      "Praise be to Allah.So long as the son is well-off, he should give zakaat al-fitr on his own behalf. If his father gives zakaat al-fitr on his behalf there is nothing wrong with that, especially if the father is accustomed to giving zakaat al-fitr on behalf of his children every year even though they are grown up and working. He may like to continue doing what he is used to doing, and it may upset the father if his son tells him “Don’t give zakaat on my behalf.” So the son should give his father the opportunity to give zakaat on his behalf, and he should also give it on his own behalf. Some people consider the father’s continued giving of zakaat on behalf of his children to be a continuation of his connection to his children and a sign that they are still under his authority and care, so the son should let his father do what makes him happy.

      "Praise be to Allah.If one is reciting Qur’aan in situations other than in prayer, then reading from the Mushaf is better, because it is more accurate and helps one to remember better. But if reciting from memory is easier and helps one to concentrate more and have better presence of mind (khushoo’), then one should recite from memory. In prayer, however, it is better to recite from memory, because if a person recites from the Mushaf, he will be doing repeated actions such as holding the Mushaf, putting it down, turning its pages and looking at the letters. By doing so he will miss out on putting his right hand over his left hand on his chest when standing during the prayer, or spreading out his arms during rukoo’ and sujood, if he puts the Mushaf under his arm. Hence we think that it is preferable for a person who is praying to recite from memory rather than from the Mushaf. We see some people when they pray behind the imaam, carrying the Mushaf and following the imaam’s recitation. This is something which should not be done, for the reasons we have referred to above, and because they do not need to do anything except follow the imaam. However, if the imaam does not have such a good memory, and he says to one of the members of the congregation, “Pray behind me, and follow me (my recitation) in the Mushaf, and if I make a mistake, correct me,” then there is nothing wrong with this.\n",

If, however, it is done for the purpose of learning, then there should be nothing wrong with it. If what is meant is that they gather to read Qur’an in order to learn it and memorize it, and one of them reads whilst the others listen, or each one reads to himself quietly, and not in unison with the others, then this is allowed because it is proven that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No people gather together in one of the houses of Allaah and read the Book of Allaah, studying it together, but tranquillity descends upon them, the angels surround them and mercy covers them, and Allaah mentions them to those who are with Him.” (Reported by Muslim).\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.The majority of fuqaha’ say that if the non-Arab can speak Arabic, he should not recite Takbeer (saying “Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great)”) in any other language. The evidence for this is that the texts instruct this particular wording, which is Arabic, and that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not do it any other way. But if a non-Arab cannot speak Arabic and is unable to pronounce it, then according to the majority of fuqaha’ it is OK for him to say the Takbeer in his own language after it has been translated from Arabic, according to the statements of the Shaafa’is and Hanbalis, no matter what the language is. The Takbeer is remembrance or mentioning of Allaah, and Allaah can be remembered or mentioned in every language, so a language other than Arabic is an alternative, and the person has to learn how to say it in the other language. There is some controversy as to whether all of the adhkaar of the prayer, such as tashahhud, qunoot, du’aa’, and the tasbeehaat in rukoo’ and sujood may be said in languages other than Arabic. With regard to reading Qur’aan, the majority say that it is not permissible to read it in any language other than Arabic. The evidence for this is the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’aan…” [Yoosuf 12:2] Moreover, the Qur’aan is a miracle in its wording and its meaning; if it is changed, this is no longer the case, and it is no longer Qur’aan but an interpretation (tafseer). (al-Mawsoo’ah al-Fiqhiyyah, part 5: A’jami). Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “Section: It is not right to read it in any language other than Arabic, or to substitute other words in Arabic, whether the person can read it well in Arabic or not, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…an Arabic Qur’aan …’ [Yoosuf 12:2] and ‘In the plain Arabic language’ [al-Shu’ara’ 26:195]. The Qur’aan is a miracle in both its wording and its meaning, but if it is changed this is no longer the case, it is not Qur’aan or anything like it. It is only an interpretation (tafseer), and if the interpretation were like the Qur’aan itself, they would not be unable to meet the challenge of producing a soorah like it. If a person cannot read well in Arabic, he has to learn. If he does not learn when he is able to, his prayers are not valid. If he is not able, or he fears that he does not have time to learn before the time for the next prayer is over, and he knows one aayah of al-Faatihah, he should repeat it seven times… If he can recite more than that, he should repeat it as much as he needs to make his recitation equivalent to the length of Soorat al-Fatihah, or he could make it up by reciting other aayaat. If he knows some aayaat he does not have to repeat, he could recite another aayah instead, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded the one who could not recite Qur’aan well to say ‘Al-Hamdu Lillaah (Praise be to Allaah)’ and other phrases, which is part of an aayah, but he did not command him to repeat it. If he cannot do anything, but he knows some of the Qur’aan by heart, he should recite whatever he can, and nothing else will do, because of the report narrated by Abu Dawood from Rifaa’ah ibn Raafi’, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “When you get up to pray, if you know some Qur’aan, recite it, otherwise say al-hamdu Lillaah (praise be to Allaah), and La ilaaha ill-Allaah (there is no god but Allaah), and Allaahu akbar (Allaah is Most Great).” This is more like Qur’aan, and is more appropriate (than any other words). He should also recite as much as he needs to make it equivalent in length to Soorat al-Faatihah. If he cannot recite anything of the Qur’aan, and cannot learn before it is too late to pray the current prayer, he should say Subhaan Allaah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wa Allaahu akbar wa Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (Glory be to Allaah; praise be to Allaah; there is no god but Allaah; Allaah is Most Great; and there is no strength and no power except with Allaah). Abu Dawood reported that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: “I cannot learn anything of the Qur’aan. Teach me something that will suffice me.” He said, “Say Subhaan Allaah wa’l-hamdu Lillaah wa Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wa Allaahu akbar wa Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah.” And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Among the many types of intellectual games to be found all over daily newspapers and magazines are the type of puzzles called crosswords, a kind of puzzle that focuses on how well educated and widely read a person is. They cover all branches of knowledge and art, and test how bright and quick-witted a person is. In principle, these puzzles are a form of permissible entertainment, but from what we see, many of the words used have evil implications, such as the names of artists who are insignificant, morally corrupt or intellectually deviated. Or the crosswords expect answers that are of no benefit and are not worth the time and effort required to solve the puzzle. In addition, they distract people from reading serious and useful material, which is like wasting one’s life in doing something that is not useful. One of the strange things we often see is that readers of newspapers and magazines go straight to the puzzles, without looking at other, useful information. This love of crossword puzzles could become an addiction, leading people to neglect their duties. On this basis, many of these puzzles would come under the category of makrooh entertainment, provided that the subject matter is not haraam and they do not lead to addiction or cause people to neglect their duties. If they do make people become negligent and forgetful, then it is more appropriate to say that they are haraam in this case. (Adapted from the book Qadaaya al-Lahw wa’l-Tarfeeh by Ma’dhoon Rasheed, p. 188) Muslims who prepare these crossword puzzles should try to put useful information in them, and words that will make readers learn things that will be of benefit to them. And Allaah is the source of strength.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.This matter has been studied by the Islamic Fiqh Council (Majma’ al-Fiqh al-Islami), who issued the following statement: One: The following five methods are forbidden according to sharee’ah. They are forbidden either in and of themselves, or because of their consequences such as mixing lineages, not knowing who the child’s mother is, or other reasons that are objectionable according to sharee’ah. When fertilization takes place between sperm taken from the husband and an egg taken from a woman who is not his wife, then the embryo is placed in his wife’s womb. When fertilization takes place between sperm taken from a man who is not the husband, and an egg taken from the wife, then the embryo is placed in the womb of the wife. When fertilization is done externally between the sperm and egg of the couple, then the embryo is placed in the womb of a woman who volunteers to carry it (“surrogate motherhood”). When fertilization is done externally between the sperm of a man who is not the husband and the egg of a woman who is not the wife, then the embryo is placed in the womb of the wife. When fertilization is done externally between the sperm and egg of the two spouses, then the embryo is placed in the womb of another wife (of the husband). Two: The sixth and seventh methods are acceptable as a last resort in cases of necessity, when it is certain that all necessary precautions have been taken. These two methods are: 6. When the sperm is taken from the husband and an egg is taken from the wife, fertilization is done externally, then the embryo is planted in the womb of the wife. 7. When the sperm of the husband is taken and injected into a suitable place in the cervix or womb of the wife so that fertilization may take place internally. Other reservations that pose a concern in this matter include: the uncovering of the woman’s ‘awrah and most private parts; the possibility of mistakes in the laboratory; the possibility that some weak-minded people in some hospitals may breach their trust and deliberately switch eggs or sperm in order to make the operation a success and earn more material gains. So we have to be extremely cautious when dealing with this matter. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Can you do ruqyah for yourself? What du`a to say in ruqyah? Dua for Ruqyah from the Sunnah Praise be to Allah.Can you do ruqyah for yourself? There is nothing wrong with the Muslim reciting ruqyah for himself. That is permissible; indeed it is a good Sunnah, for the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited ruqyah for himself, and some of his Companions recited ruqyah for themselves. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was ill, he would recite al-Mu'awwidhat over himself and spit drily. When his pain grew intense, I recited over him and wiped him with his own hand, seeking its barakah (blessing).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4728; Muslim, 2192) With regard to the hadith narrated by Muslim (220), according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described the seventy thousand of this ummah who will enter Paradise without being brought to account or punished, and in which it says: “They are those who did not recite ruqyah or ask for ruqyah to be done , and they did not believe in bad omens and they put their trust in their Lord” – the phrase “they did not recite ruqyah” is the words of the narrator, not of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Hence al-Bukhari narrated this hadith (no. 5420) and he did not mention this phrase. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: These people are praised because they did not ask anyone to recite ruqyah for them, and ruqyah is a type of du`a, so they did not ask others to pray for them. The phrase “and they did not recite ruqyah” which is mentioned in the hadith is a mistake (on the part of the narrator), for their ruqyah for themselves and for others is a good deed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited ruqyah for himself and for others; he did not ask anyone to recite ruqyah for him. His reciting ruqyah for himself and others was like his making du`a for himself and others; this is something that is enjoined, for all the Prophets asked of Allah and prayed to Him, as Allah tells us in the stories of Adam, Ibrahim, Musa and others.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 1/182) Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said: This phrase is inserted in the hadith, but it is a mistake on the part of some of the narrators. (Hadi al-Arwah, 1/89) Ruqyah is one of the greatest remedies that the believer should use regularly. What du`a to say in ruqyah? With regard to the du`a that is prescribed for the Muslim to say if he wants to recite ruqyah for himself or for someone else, there are many such du`as, the greatest of which are al-Fatihah and al-Mu'awwidhat. A group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set out on a journey and travelled until they came near one of the Arab tribes. They asked them for hospitality but they refused to do so. Then the leader of that tribe was stung, and they tried everything but nothing helped him. Then some of them said, Why don’t you go to those people who are staying (nearby)? Maybe some of them have something. So they went to them and said, O people, our leader has been stung and we have tried everything and nothing helped him. Do any of you have something? One of them said, Yes, by Allah. I will perform ruqyah for him, but by Allah we asked you for hospitality and you did not give us anything, so we will not perform ruqyah for you unless you give us something in return. So they agreed on a flock of sheep, then he started to blow on him and recite Al-hamdu Lillahi Rabb il-‘Alamin. Then he recovered quickly from his complaint and started walking, and there was nothing wrong with him. Then they gave them what they had agreed to, and some of them (the Sahabah) said, Let us share it out. The one who had performed ruqyah said, Do not do anything until we come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and tell him what happened, and we will wait and see what he tells us to do. So they came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. He said, “How did you know that it is a ruqyah?” Then he said, “You did the right thing. Share them out, and give me a share.” And the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) smiled. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2276, and by Muslim, 2201). ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: “When the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was ill, he would recite al-Mu'awwidhat over himself and spit drily. When his pain grew intense, I recited over him and wiped him with his own hand, seeking its barakah (blessing).” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 4728; Muslim, 2192) Dua for Ruqyah from the Sunnah The du`as that have been narrated in the Sunnah include the following: Muslim (2202) narrated from ‘Uthman ibn Abi’l-As that he complained to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about pain that he had felt in his body from the time he had become Muslim. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to him: “Put your hand on the part of your body where you feel pain and say ‘Bismillah (in the name of Allah) three times, then say seven times, ‘A’udhu bi ‘izzat-illah wa qudratihi min sharri ma ajid wa uhadhir (I seek refuge in the glory and power of Allah from the evil of what I feel and worry about).” Al-Tirmidhi (2080) added: He said, I did that, and Allah took away what I had been suffering, and I kept on enjoining my family and others to do that.” (Classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih al-Tirmidhi, 1696) Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to seek refuge for al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and he would say: “Your father [ meaning Ibrahim, peace be upon him] used to seek refuge with Allah for Isma’il and Ishaq with these words: Audhu bi kalimat Allah al-tammah min kulli shaytanin wa hammah wa min kulli ‘aynin lammah (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah, from every devil and every poisonous reptile, and from every evil eye).’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 3191) For more, please see this category: Reciting the Quran Over a Sick And Allah knows best.\n",

Shaykh: And they are not at war with the Muslims? - It is possible that they may be at war with the Muslims in the future. Shaykh: We do not give the future precedence over the present (i.e., we do not count on that or take it into consideration). - This questioner says, 'I work in a place where the soldiers are not fighting the Muslims. But it is possible that some of the army may be fighting them in other places, and it is possible that we may be involved in such fighting in the future, but the military bases where I work now are not involved in fighting against the Muslims. Shaykh: But is this nation (in which this army is) one of those who are fighting the Muslims? - The questioner is working for the American army, he is a Muslim working in America. Shaykh: Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion and did not drive you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity. [al-Mumtahinah 60:8]. - And what if they are not driving us out of our homes, but they are helping others to do so, as mentioned in the next aayah? Shaykh: It is only as regards those who fought you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allaah forbids you to befriend them [al-Mumtahinah 60:9 interpretation of the meaning]. - So if it is clear to him that these people are helping to drive us out of our homes, for example, would working for them for a salary come under the just and kind treatment mentioned in the aayah? Shaykh: No doubt it does come under that heading. - Even if you are working for money and not as a volunteer? Shaykh: Yes, but they are benefitting from it. - So how may we sum up your answer? Shaykh: This is not permissible unless the nation in whose army he is working is not fighting the Muslims. - And not driving them out of their homes or helping others to do so? Shaykh: Yes.

      "Praise be to Allah.It is mustahabb to have the habit of sitting for a brief rest during prayer, i.e., after the two prostrations of each rak’ah in which one does not recite the Tashahhud immediately after the prostrations. A hadeeth to this effect was reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari. It was also reported in Sunan Abi Dawood and Sunan al-Tirmidhi via different isnaads that are also saheeh. This is the correct view according to scholarly consensus in the madhhab of al-Shaafa’i. Jalsah al-istiraahah is not mustahaab after sajdat al-tilaawah (prostration during recitation of Qur’aan) during prayer. (Words of Imaam al-Nawawi). Jalsah al-istiraahah is a brief pause, sitting for a short while after the second prostration and before standing up. It is Sunnah according to al-Shaafa’i, Ishaaq and Ahmad. It was reported that Abu Qulaabah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “Maalik ibn al-Huwayrith showed us how the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed, and when he raised his head from the second prostration in the first rak’ah, he sat and then stood up.” (Reported by all five major scholars of hadeeth apart from Muslim). The wording according to al-Bukhaari was: “When he raised his head from the second prostration, he sat and settled on the ground, then he stood up.” I say: one of the features of the prayer is jalsah al-istiraahah which should be done after every prostration from which one stands up. It is not Sunnah to do Jalsah al-Istiraahah after Sajdat al-Tilaawah, or when one is praying sitting down, or in the fourth or second rak’ah of Zuhr, for example, if a person wants to recite Tashahhud. If he does not want to recite it, then it is Sunnah to do Jalsah al-istiraahah. It is a separation between the two rak’ahs, according to the soundest opinion, it is not a part of either the first rak’ah or the second. The best is not to make it last longer than a few seconds, because according to the Sunnah, the shorter it is the better, like when one keeps quiet in prayer.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for him to do that, and it should be knocked down. (Words of Imaam al-Nawawi). Taking graves as mosques or places of worship is one of the customs of the Jews with whom Allaah is angry. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: May Allaah destroy the Jews! They have taken their graves as places of worship. (Agreed upon). Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the women who visit graves and those who build mosques over them and place lamps on them. Some of them claim that this was because at that time they were still close to the time when people had worshipped idols, but Ibn Daqeeq al-Eed refuted this argument. This indicates that it is haraam to place lamps on graves because this could lead to false beliefs. In addition to the issue of building mosques over graves, this person's actions also involve going against the conditions set by the one who endowed this land. Moreover, he is denying the Muslim dead space in which to be buried. Adding any extra structure over a grave as the ignorant people among the Muslims do is haraam, as stated by the fuqaha and ulama, let alone building mosques over graves. So the imaam (Imaam al-Nawawi) ruled that whatever mosques had been built over the graves should be torn down. (Comment in the margin of Fataawa al-Imaam al-Nawawi, p. 65).\n",

This ban applies to both men and women, except for the man who is engaged in jihaad (mujaahid). Al-Maawirdi said: “It is not haraam in his case.” In Saheeh Muslim it is reported from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw that the beard of Abu Quhaafah, who was the father of Abu Bakr al-Siddeeq (may Allaah be pleased with him), was so white, he said, “Change this, but avoid black.” (The above is the words of Imaam al-Nawawi). Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that he saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) dyeing his beard with a yellowish colour. According to another report, he added, “And I would like to do this.” Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah reported that Wahb said: “We entered upon Umm Salamah (may Allaah be pleased with her) and she brought out some of the hair of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to show us. It was dyed with henna and katam.” Katam is a plant that is mixed with henna, and it is used to dye the hair and preserve the colour, as is stated in al-Qaamoos. When katam is used alone, not mixed with anything, it produces a reddish-black colour. Some people have the habit of dyeing their hair pure black at peace time (i.e., when not engaged in jihaad). This is not right according to sharee’ah. There have been cases where prospective brides and their families have been deceived and cheated when a prospective husband has dyed his hair to give the impression of being young and strong when in fact he is old and weak.\n",

It was reported from Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no zakaat due on grains or dates unless they reach the amount of five awsuq.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others. This is if they are measurable, so it is more appropriate that no zakaat should be paid on things that are not measured at all. It was reported from ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib in a marfoo’ report – and some said it was mawqoof – “There is no zakaat due on vegetables.” Moreover, neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) nor his successors (al-Khulafaa’ al-Raashidoon) collected zakaah for fruits and vegetables. Although they were grown in their regions, there was no zakaah paid on them. This indicates that there is no zakaah to be paid for these things. And your garden is for your own personal use, not for business purposes, so it is definite that there is no zakaat required for the produce of this garden. But if it is for business purposes, and you keep the profit from it for one complete year, in this case you would have to pay zakaah on the money which you have had for one complete year. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There is nothing at all wrong with conveying what you know of the religion of Allaah to non-Muslims, as long as you are certain that it is correct, such as the basics that you mention, like the five pillars of Islam or the pillars of eemaan (faith). Indeed, this is probably obligatory upon you, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islam), enjoining al-ma’roof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islam orders one to do) and forbidding al-munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:104] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Convey from me, even an aayah.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: He said in the hadeeth, “even an aayah”, meaning one aayah, as if he was saying that every listener should hasten to convey whatever aayaat he heard, even if it is only a few. Some of the Sahaabah set out to call their tribes to Islam when they had only a little knowledge that they had gained during the brief time they had sat with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). But even though their knowledge was so little, it was correct and was blessed, and because of their sincerity, Allaah benefitted others through it. Al-Tufayl ibn ‘Umar went from Makkah to his people Daws with the limited amount of knowledge that he had, then he came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in Madeenah accompanied by eighty families of Daws, all of whom had become Muslim, and among whom was Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him). Know that some non-Muslims may become Muslim for the slightest reason and by hearing the briefest word said to them. Do not think that the knowledge you have is too little for the purposes of conveying the Message. “… invite them to your Lord. Verily! You indeed are on the (true) straight guidance.” [al-Hajj 22:67 – interpretation of the meaning].\n",

Some passengers also ask him to take them to places such as nightclubs. Is it permissible for him to work in this occupation or to accept these fares? The shaykh, may Allaah preserve him, replied as follows: No, it is not permissible for him to stop at the liquor store for his passenger to buy some, and it is not permissible for him to take anyone to forbidden clubs, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Help you one another in al-birr and al-taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression [al-Maaidah 5:2].

      "Praise be to Allah.Subhaan-Allaah, how have Muslim women reached a state where they do not know how to kill time, so they waste it and destroy the blessing of time which Allaah has made available to them to fill it with worship, dhikr and good deeds, as He explains (interpretation of the meaning): “And it is He Who has put the night and the day in succession, for such who desires to remember or desires to show his gratitude.” [al-Furqaan 25:62] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Make the most of five things before five others come: your life before your death, your health before your sickness, your spare time before your work, your youth before your old age and your wealth before your poverty.” (Reported by al-Haakim; see also Saheeh al-Jaami’, 1077). It is regrettable that a Muslim cannot find anything to do other than committing the sin of watching TV programs that are filled with scenes of kufr, nakedness, and singing. The one who looks at this tragedy will indeed see how accurate are the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the saheeh hadeeth: “There are two blessings of which many people have an unfair share: good health and spare time.” (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5933). You must exhort this woman, in a gentle manner, and remind her, kindly, why she was created in this life. There follow a few useful suggestions which include both serious pursuits and permissible forms of leisure activities. Doing acts of worship such as reciting dhikr and wird, salaah, reading Qur’aan, fasting, and thinking about the signs of Allaah in His creation. Adopting an Islamic cause in the place where she is living, and taking part in it, such as teaching Muslim girls, supporting an Islamic magazine by sending articles, statistics and useful information of interest concerning Muslims in the West, taking part in charitable projects to help Muslim orphans, widows, divorcees and elderly, or joining a committee to help organize social programs and celebrations for Muslim girls on Eid. Finding righteous (female) companions to meet with and good (females) neighbours to visit. Reading Islamic books in particular and useful stories in general. Taking part in da’wah activities, women’s activities and preschool programs in Islamic centres. Listening to tapes and lectures, writing summaries of them, and distributing the summaries to anyone who could benefit from them. Doing arts and crafts, and cooking items to be sold to raise funds for the Islamic centre. Taking an interest in computers and computer programs. This is a vast field that can fill a lot of time, and the computer can be used to do a lot of good things as well as providing entertainment in the form of permissible games. Spinning, weaving, cutting out and sewing. Gardening. Exercising at home. In all cases, you must resist pressures that may make you give in and introduce that window of evil to your home. We ask Allaah to grant your wife a righteous child in the near future, so that she may fill her time with taking care of him. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

Thirdly, you should not despair of the mercy of Allaah or say “Allaah will not forgive me.” “No one despairs of Allaah’s soothing mercy except those who have no faith” [Yoosuf 12:87 – interpretation of the meaning]; “And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, but such as go astray?” [al-Hijr 15:56 – interpretation of the meaning].

      "Praise be to Allah.The issue of watching films is not free from numerous reservations from a shar’i point of view, such as uncovering ‘awraat, listening to music, spreading corrupt beliefs and calling for imitation of the kuffaar. Allaah has commanded us to lower our gaze, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allâh is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts)” [al-Noor 24:30-31]. Since lowering the gaze is the basis of protecting the private parts, it is mentioned first. Allaah has made the eyes the reflection of the heart: if a person lowers his gaze, the desire in his heart will be reduced, but if a person looks and stares, the desire in his heart will be provoked. In Saheeh Muslim (1218) it is reported that Al-Fadl ibn ‘Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) was riding behind the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on the Day of Sacrifice (Yawm al-Nahr) from Muzdalifah to Mina, when some women riding on camel-borne sedan chairs passed by. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) turned his [al-Fadl’s] head away. This was prevention and denunciation through action, for if looking were permissible he would have approved of what he did. In Saheeh al-Bukhaari (6343) it is reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Every son of Adam has his share of zinaa decreed for him, and he will undoubtedly get his share. The eye commits zinaa and its zinaa is looking. The tongue commits zinaa and its zinaa is speaking; the feet commit zinaa and their zinaa is walking; the hands commit zinaa and their zinaa is touching. The heart longs and desires for something and the private parts confirm that or deny it.” He began by mentioning the eye because this is how the zinaa of the hand, foot, heart and private parts begins. By mentioning the zinaa of the tongue, he pointed out that the mouth can commit zinaa by speaking. And he stated that the private parts can confirm that if they make the deed happen, or deny it if that does not happen. This hadeeth gives the clearest indication that the eye can sin by looking and that this is its zinaa. This is a refutation to those who say that looking is allowed in all circumstances. It was also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O ‘Ali, do not follow a look with a second, for the first look is allowable but not the second.” A look has the same effect on the heart as an arrow has on its victim. If it does not kill him, it will wound him. It is like a spark of fire in dried grass; if it does not burn all of it, it will still burn some of it. May Allaah have mercy on the one who said: “Everything starts with a look, and big fires start from little sparks. How often has a heart been dealt a fatal blow like that of an arrow, with no need for a bow. As long as a man’s eyes are looking around, looking into the eyes of others, he is in a state of danger. His eye delights in that which could destroy his heart. The joy that may lead to harm is not welcome.” Hence Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Fataawa 3/227: With regard to television, it is a dangerous device and its harmful effects are very great, like those of the cinema, or even worse. We know from the research that has been written about it and from the words of experts in Arab countries and elsewhere enough to indicate that it is dangerous and very harmful to Islamic beliefs (‘aqeedah), morals and the state of society. This is because it includes the presentation of bad morals, tempting scenes, immoral pictures, semi-nakedness, destructive speech, and Kufr. It encourages imitation of their conduct and ways of dressing, respect for their leaders, neglect of Islamic conduct and ways of dressing, and looking down on the scholars and heroes of Islam. It damages their image by portraying them in an off-putting manner that makes people despise them and ignore them. It shows people how to cheat, steal, hatch plots and commit acts of violence against others. Undoubtedly anything that produces so many bad results should be stopped and shunned, and we have to close all the doors that could lead to it. If some of our brothers denounce it and speak out against it, we cannot blame them, because this is a part of sincerity towards Allaah and towards other people. Whoever thinks that this device (TV) can be free of these evils and can be used only for good purposes if it is censored properly is exaggerating and is making a big mistake, because the censor may miss things and most people nowadays want to imitate the foreigners. It is very rare to find censors who are doing their job properly, especially nowadays when most people are only interested in time-wasting entertainment and things that turn people away from true guidance. Reality bears witness to that. We ask Allaah to keep us safe from all evil for He is the Most Generous.\n",

It is not permissible for us to help the enemies of Allaah with programs that may cause harm to the Muslims and give the kuffaar more power. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5:2] This applies whether the harm is something that may happen in the future, which is the situation when there is peace, or is something that may happen immediately, as in the case of kuffaar who are in a state of war with the Muslims.

      "Praise be to Allah.Firstly: It should be known that Allaah, may He be exalted and glorified, is Wise in His commands and prohibitions. He does not command anything except that which is in peoples best interests and He does not forbid anything except that which is harmful. People may or may not come to understand the reasons behind these commands and prohibitions, although Allaah has His Wisdom in any given issue. Having said that, it is still not right to make following a command or prohibition dependent upon knowing the wisdom behind it; rather we should hasten to carry out the commands of shareeah, regardless of whether the wisdom behind it is clear to us or not. If it is clear, then praise be to Allaah, and if it is not, then the Muslim should not let the fact that he does not know it prevent him from acting in accordance with the ruling of shareeah. This is true submission to the command of Allaah, and Islam means submission to Allaah, may He be exalted, and obeying Him. If a person makes his actions dependent on understanding matters which may or may not convince him, he is in effect following his own thoughts and desires, not his Lord and Master. The above does not mean that it is not important to look for the wisdom behind the rules of shareeah, or that doing so is forbidden, but we should not make knowing the reasons a condition for acting upon the ruling. Secondly: there is no connection between things that are prohibited in this world and those that are allowed in the Hereafter. It is not correct to think of the Hereafter as being like this world; each realm has its own rules and laws. It is not correct to suggest that something is permitted in this world on the basis that it is permitted in Paradise or in the Hereafter, otherwise we would end up allowing things that we know from the basics of Islam are forbidden, such as drinking wine, taking more than four wives, singing etc. On this basis, the confusion reflected in the question about silk being forbidden in this world although it is permitted in Paradise should be cleared up. Thirdly: The scholars have discussed the reasons for silk being forbidden for men in this world. For example, al-Allaamah Ibn al-Qayyim suggested in his brilliant work Zaad al-Maaad that Among those who believe that there is reason and wisdom (behind the rulings of Islam) and they are the majority are some who answer that Islam has forbidden it so that people will keep away from it and give it up for the sake of Allaah, so they will be rewarded for that. Others reply that it was basically created for women, as is the case with gold jewellery, so it was forbidden for men because it can corrupt them by making them resemble women. Some of them said that it was forbidden because of what it may lead to in the way of pride, showing off and self-admiration. Some of them said that it was forbidden because when it touches the body, it makes a man effeminate and goes against his masculinity and manliness, so if he wears it his heart gains the characteristics of femininity and softness, as is obvious, even if he was the most masculine and chivalrous of men. There is no doubt that wearing silk will diminish these manly characteristics, if not take them away altogether. Whoever is too dense to understand this should just submit to the Wise Lawmaker.

If it is possible for him not to pay the interest on the loan, then he should not pay it, but he should not make a gain twice. The Muslim judge or leader should take the amount he was supposed to pay in riba and give it in charity or put it in the bayl al-maal (Islamic treasury). Question: You said, “he should not make a gain twice.” What does this mean? Answer: The first gain was when he benefitted from the money that he took from the bank, for example. The second gain is the interest which, if he does not pay it to the bank, he will have made a second gain… But still, he should not pay it to the one who loaned him the money on the basis of interest. For example, if he borrowed a million and owes interest of one hundred thousand, do we say pay back the million and keep the hundred thousand? No, we say pay back the million but do not give the hundred thousand to the usurer, and do not keep it for yourself as a profit or gain… Put it in the bayt al-maal or give it in charity.

But the reason behind your question seems to be that you want to keep from doing it openly in front of some people for a specific purpose, or to avoid a specific evil. Secondly, talking about Tawheed and basic matters of aqeedah and teaching people about these things among the people you describe, is undoubtedly more important. Tawheed is the key to the call of the Messengers (peace be upon them) and the first duty of the one who is accountable. It is the condition for all other deeds to be accepted. If it is clear to you, or you believe it to be most likely that adhering to some mustahabb actions, such as moving your finger etc., may cause confusion or fitnah, or cause you trouble, or damage your reputation so that people are put off you and do not listen to you, or distract the people you are addressing from what is more important, then there is nothing wrong with not doing it for this reason in these circumstances.

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah is al-Razzaaq (the Provider) and the best of those who give provision. “And no moving (living) creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah” [Hood 11:6 – interpretation of the meaning]. The rizq (provision) of Allaah will not be brought by the carefulness of the miser, nor will it be prevented by the hostility of one who does not want it to come to another. It is part of the Wisdom of Allaah that He differentiates between His slaves in their provision just as He differentiates between them in their physical creation and their attitudes. So He gives in abundance to whomever He wills and gives little to whomever He wills. He may give plenty to some people and little to others. He is the One Who guarantees the provision of His slaves according to His prior knowledge and decree. Allaah knows and decrees that some of His slaves will be given plenty and some will be given little; He has reasons for that that are beyond our comprehension. In His wisdom, He gives plenty or gives little as a test for His slaves, testing them with blessings or with calamities, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good” [al-Anbiya’ 21:35] Allâh says (interpretation of the meaning): “But when He tries him be straitening his means of life, he says: ‘My Lord has humiliated me!” [al-Fajr 89:16] But then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Nay!” [al-Fajr 89:16], meaning, it is not as he thinks; Allaah blesses whoever he wills and makes things difficult for whomever He wills, and this is a test, not a sign of honour or humiliation.

      "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly forgetfulness is something that is natural in man, and man is only called insaan because of his forgetfulness (nasiy). Usually this varies from one person to another, according to the differences in the strength of the memory that Allaah has created in His slaves. The Qur’aan “escapes” from the heart if the Muslim does not constantly and regularly review what he has memorized of it. The reason for this may be that it is a test of people’s hearts, to show the difference between the one whose heart is attached to the Qur’aan and regularly recites it, and the one whose heart is attached to it only whilst memorizing it, then he loses interest and forgets it. The reason may also be to give the Muslim a stronger motive to recite the Qur’aan more frequently so as to attain the immense reward for every letter that he recites. If it were the case that he could learn it and never forget it, he would not need to read it frequently and then he would miss out on the reward for reciting and reviewing it regularly. Fear of forgetting it will make you keen to recite it so as to gain more reward with your Lord. For every letter you recite you will have one hasanah, and the reward for one hasanah is ten like it. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged us to read Qur’aan regularly lest we forget it. He warned us against being negligent in this regard, as was stated in numerous ahaadeeth, including the following: 1-The hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The likeness of the one who memorizes the Qur’aan is that of the owner of a hobbled camel. If he tends to it regularly, he will keep it, but if he lets it go, he will lose it.” (al-Bukhaari, 5031). It is well known that if a camel escapes and runs away, it cannot be recaptured except with a lot of stress and difficulty. Similarly, if the person who memorizes Qur’aan does not regularly review what he has memorized, he will lose it and will require a great deal of effort to get it back. * Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (9/79), in his commentary on this hadeeth: so long as one constantly reviews it, what one has memorized will remain, as is the case with a camel, if it remains hobbled, you will keep it. The camel was singled out here because it is the most likely of domesticated animals to run away, and if it does run away, recapturing it is very difficult. 2 – Muslim narrated in his Saheeh (no. 790 and 791) from Abu Moosa (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Read this Qur’aan regularly for, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, it is more likely to escape than a hobbled camel.” 3 – Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) narrated that ‘Abd-Allaah said: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “It is not right for any one of you to say, ‘I have forgotten such and such.’ On the contrary, he has been made to forget. Try to review the Qur’aan, for it is more likely to escape from men’s hearts than camels.” (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 5032). Al-Haafiz said in al-Fath (9/81): Ibn Battaal said, This hadeeth is in accordance with the two aayahs (interpretation of the meanings): ‘Verily, We shall send down to you a weighty Word’ [al-Muzzammil 73:5] and ‘And We have indeed made the Qur’ân easy to understand and remember’ [al-Qamar 54:17] So whoever strives to memorize it and recite it regularly, it will be made easy for him, and whoever turns away from it, will lose it. This is what encourages us to constantly review what we have memorized and to keep on reciting it, lest we forget it. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave this example because it is the best way to explain what he meant. He also confirmed it with his oath ‘by the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad’, to affirm the importance of constantly reciting the Qur’aan and reviewing what one has learned. 3 – With regard to the report that Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The sins of my ummah were shown to me and there is no sin greater than that of a man who was given orwas helped to memorize a soorah or an aayah of the Qur’aan and then he forgot it.” This is a weak (da’eef) hadeeth which was classed as such by al-Bukhaari and al-Tirmidhi. See Takhreej Mishkaat al-Masaabeeh by al-Albaani, no. 720. Imaam Ibn al-Munaadi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Mutashaabih al-Qur’aan (p. 52): The Salaf were always afraid of forgetting Qur’aan after they had memorized it, because this was a shortcoming. Al-Suyooti said in al-Itqaan (1/106): Forgetting it is a major sin, as was stated by al-Nawawi in al-Rawdah and others, because of the hadeeth “I was shown the sins of my ummah…” One of the best ways to help oneself to remember what one has memorized and to make it firmly-entrenched is to recite it in one’s salaah, especially in Qiyaam al-Layl. The Salaf used to recite it during the day and when praying Qiyaam al-Layl. If you strive hard to review the Qur’aan regularly, there will be no sin on you even if you do forget some of it. The blame is on those who neglect it and fail to review it and read it regularly. We ask Allaah to forgive us. O Allaah, make the Qur’aan the life of my heart, the light of my breast, a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety. O Allaah, teach us from it that which we do not know and remind us from it of that which we have forgotten, for You are the All-Hearing, All-Knowing.\n",

This is the first mosque that was built for people on earth, as Allaah says in the Qur’aan (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for al-‘aalameen (mankind and jinns).” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:96]. It was reported in Saheeh Muslim that Abu Dharr said: “I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about the first mosque to be built for people on earth. He said, ‘Al-Masjid al-Haraam.’ I asked, ‘Then which?’ He said, ‘Al-Masjid al-Aqsaa [The Furthest Mosque, in Jerusalem].’ I asked, ‘How long between them?’ He said, ‘Forty years.’” The Ka’bah – which is the direction of prayer for all Muslims throughout the world – is situated roughly in the middle of al-Masjid al-Haraam. It is a 15-meter high stone structure more or less in the shape of a cube. It was built by Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) on the command of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the (Sacred) House (the Ka’bah at Makkah) (saying): ‘Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, and those who bow and make prostration.” [al-Hajj 22:26] The word “bawwa’naa” [translated here as “We showed”] means “He guided him and gave him permission to build it.” (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). Allaah also says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) when Ibraaheem and (his son) Ismaa’eel were raising the foundations of the House (the Ka’bah at Makkah)…” [al-Baqarah 2:127] Wahb ibn Munbih said: “… It was built by Ibraaheem, then [rebuilt] by the Amalekites, then by Jurham, then by Qusayy ibn Kilaab. Its rebuilding by Quraysh is well known… They began to rebuild it with the stones of the valley, which Quraysh carried on their shoulders, and they built it up, 20 cubits high… Between the rebuilding of the Ka’bah and the beginning of the Revelation there were five years, and between the rebuilding and the Hijrah there were fifteen years. ‘Abd al-Razzaaq reported from Mu’ammar from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Uthmaan from Abu’l-Tufayl, and from Mu’ammar from al-Zuhri: ‘They were building it and when they reached al-Rukn, Quraysh argued about which tribe should lift it up. Then they said, “Let us ask the first person who comes from this direction to judge between us.” They agreed on that, then the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to them, and he was a young man wearing a spotted sash. They asked him to judge between them, and he told them to place al-Rukn on a piece of cloth, then he told the chief of every tribe to hold the edge of the cloth, then he climbed up and they lifted al-Rukn up to him, and he himself (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) put it into its place.” (Taareekh Makkah by al-Azraqi, 1/161-164) Muslim (2374) reported that ‘Aa’ishah said: “I asked the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about al-Jadr [the wall] and whether it was part of the House [the Ka’bah]. He said, ‘Yes.’ I asked, ‘So why is it not incorporated into the House?’ He said, ‘Your people ran out of money.’ I asked, ‘What about the door? Why is it high up?’ He said, ‘Your people did that so they could let in whomever they wanted and keep out whomever they wanted. If it were not for the fact that your people are still new [in Islam] and too close to their Jaahiliyyah, and I am afraid that they would resent it, I would think of incorporating al-Jadr into the House and bringing the door down to ground level.’” Before Islam (in the year in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was born), the Ka’bah was subjected to an attack by the Ethiopian Abrahah, who had built al-Qulays, a church to which he wanted the Arabs to make their pilgrimage. He set out with his army, with whom was the elephant, and when they reached Makkah, Allaah sent flocks of birds against them; each bird was carrying three stones like chickpeas or lentils, one in its beak and two in its claws. Every man who was struck by a stone was killed, so the army was destroyed, by the command of Allaah. Allaah has mentioned this incident in His Book, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): “Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the Owners of the Elephant? Did He not make their plot go astray? And sent against them birds, in flocks, Striking them with stones of Sijjeel, And made them like an empty field of slaks (in which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).” [al-Feel 105:1-5] (See al-Seerah al-Nabawiyyah by Ibn Hishaam, 1/44-58). There was no fence or wall around the Ka’bah until it became necessary. Yaaqoot al-Hamawi said in Mu’jam al-Buldaan (5/146): “The first one to build a wall around the Ka’bah was ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him); there was no wall around it during the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or Abu Bakr. [The wall was built] because people were building their houses too close to the Ka’bah and making the space around it too small for people. ‘Umar said: ‘The Ka’bah is the House of Allaah, and a house needs a courtyard. You have encroached on its space, it has not encroached on yours.’ So he bought those houses, demolished them and added that space to the space around the Ka’bah. He also destroyed the houses of people in the vicinity of the Ka’bah who had refused to sell, and kept the money aside for them until they came and took it later on. He built a wall around the mosque, lower than the height of a man, and lamps were placed on it. When ‘Uthmaan was khaleefah, he bought more houses that were more expensive… It was said that ‘Uthmaan was the first one to build porticos around it … When Ibn al-Zubayr was in power, he improved its appearance, although he did not increase its size, by adding marble pillars, extra doors and other improvements. When ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwaan was khaleefah, he added to the wall of the mosque, and brought columns from Egypt by sea to Jeddah, which were carried from Jeddah to Makkah on wheels. Al-Hajjaaj ibn Yoosuf commanded that the Ka’bah should be covered in drapes (al-kiswah) and when al-Waleed ibn ‘Abd al-Malik was khaleefah, he added to the adornment of the kiswah and spent money on improvements to the drainage spout and roof… When al-Mansoor and his son al-Mahdi were khaleefahs, they added more adornments to the mosque and improved its appearance.” There are also other religious monuments in the Mosque, such as Maqaam Ibraaheem (the Station of Ibraaheem), which is the rock on which Ibraaheem (peace be upon him) stood whilst he was building the Ka’bah. There is also the Well of Zamzam, which is a spring of water brought forth by Allaah for Haajar and her child Ismaa’eel (peace be upon him) when he got thirsty. We should not forget either the Black Stone and al-Rukn al-Yamaani, which are two of the precious stones of Paradise. Al-Tirmidhi and Ahmad reported that ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Amr said: “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying that the Rukn and the Maqaam are two of the precious stones of Paradise, whose light has been extinguished by Allaah. If He had not extinguished their light, it would illuminate everything between the East and the West.” (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 804). Near the Mosque are the two hills of al-Safa and al-Marwah. One of the unique features of the Mosque is that it is the only mosque in the world to which people come on pilgrimage (Hajj). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily! Al-Safa and al-Marwah are of the Symbols of Allaah. So it is not a sin on him who performs Hajj or ‘Umrah (pilgrimage) of the House to perform the going (tawaaf) between them. And whoever does good voluntarily, then verily, Allaah is All-Recognizer, All-Knower.” [al-Baqarah 2:158] Another of its unique features is that Allaah has made it safe, and one prayer in it is equal to a hundred thousand prayers elsewhere. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And (remember) when We made the House a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take you (people) the Maqaam (place) of Ibraaheem as a place of prayer, and We commanded Ibraaheem and Ismaa’eel that they should purify My House for those who are circumabulating it, or staying (I’tikaaf), or bowing or prostrating themselves.” [al-Baqarah 2:125] “In it are manifest signs (for example); the maqaam (place) of Ibraaheem; whoever enters it, he attains security. And Hajj to the House is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for one’s conveyance, provision and residence); and whoever disbelieves [i.e., denies Hajj, then he is a disbeliever of Allaah], then Allaah stands not in need of any of the ‘aalameen (mankind and jinns).” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:97] (See Akhbaar Makkah by al-Azraqi and Akhbaar Makkah by al-Faakihi). And Allaah is the Source of Strength and the Guide to the Straight Path.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.There are many things that one can do to help oneself pray qiyaam al-layl, among which are the following: 1 Being sincere towards Allaah, as He has commanded us to be sincere towards Him and none other in our deeds. He tells us (interpretation of the meaning): And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone [al-Bayyinah 98:5]. The more sincere a person is towards Allaah, the more he will be guided and helped to obey Allaah and draw closer to Him. Ubayy ibn Kab (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Give glad tidings to this ummah (nation/community)of splendour, religion, high rank, victory and prevalence on earth. Whoever does the deeds of the Hereafter to gain some worldly benefit, will have no share of the Hereafter. (Reported by Ahmad. Saheeh al-Jaami, 2825). Mutarraf ibn Abd-Allaah ibn al-Shakheer said: The goodness of a deed is related to the goodness of the heart, and the goodness of the heart is related to the goodness of the intention. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The degree to which a person is helped and aided by Allaah depends on the degree of his intention, drive, aim and hopes. Help from Allaah comes to people in proportion to their drive, intention, hopes and fears, and failure comes to them in like manner. Therefore the salaf (pious predecessors) were very keen to conceal their acts of worship such as qiyaam al-layl. A man asked Tameem ibn Aws al-Daari (may Allaah be pleased with him), How do you pray at night? He got very angry and said, By Allaah, one rakah that I pray in secret in the small hours of the night is more beloved to me than praying the whole night long and then telling people about it. Ayyoob al-Sakhtiyaani used to spend the entire night in prayer, then when dawn approached, he would go back to bed and lie down, and when dawn came, he would raise his voice as if he had just woken up. 2 The person who wants to pray qiyaam al-layl should realize that Allaah is calling him to qiyaam. When the slave realizes that his Master, Who has no need of peoples worship, is calling him to do this, he will respond. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you wrapped in your garments (i.e., Prophet Muhammad)! Stand (to pray) all night, except a little. Half of it, or a little less than that, or a little more; and recite the Quraan (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style. [al-Muzzammil 73:1-4]. Sad ibn Hishaam ibn Aamir said to Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her): Tell me about how the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prayed qiyaam. She said: Have you not read Yaa ayyuhal-muzzammil (O you wrapped in your garments!)? He said, Of course. She said: Allaah, may He be exalted and glorified, made qiyaam obligatory at the beginning of this soorah, so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions prayed qiyaam for a year, and Allaah withheld the end of this soorah for twelve months, until He revealed something at the end of this soorah to make things easier, so qiyaam al-layl became voluntary after it had been obligatory. (Reported by Muslim). 3 Knowing the virtues of qiyaam al-layl. Whoever knows the virtues of this act of worship will be keen to talk to Allaah, may He be exalted, and to stand before Him at that time. Among the reports that describe the virtues of this act of worship is the hadeeth (narration)of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The best of prayers after the prescribed prayers is prayer in the depths of the night, and the best of fasting after the month of Ramadaan is fasting the month of Allaah, Muharram. (reported by Muslim). Abd-Allaah ibn Amr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The most beloved of prayer to Allaah is the prayer of Dawood, and the most beloved of fasts to Allaah is the fast of Dawood. He used to sleep for half of the night, then get up and pray for a third of the night, then sleep for a sixth of the night, and he used to fast every other day. (Agreed upon). Amr ibn Absah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The closest that the Lord is to His slave is in the later part of the night, so if you can be one of those who remember Allaah at that time, then do so. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nisaa'i). According to a hadeeth narrated by Ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Our Lord admires two men: a man who leaves his mattress and cover, and slips away from his wife and lover, to go and pray. Allaah says, O My angels, look at My slave. He has left his mattress and cover and slipped away from his lover and wife to pray, out of hope for what is with Me and out of fear of what is with Me. (Reported by Ahmad. It is a hasan (sound) report. Saheeh al-Targheeb, 258). Qiyaam al-Layl expels forgetfulness from the heart, as is stated in the hadeeth narrated by Abd-Allaah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas (may Allaah be pleased with them both), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever recites ten aayaat (verses)in qiyaam will not be recorded as one of the forgetful. Whoever recites a hundred aayaat in qiyaam will be recorded as one of the devout , and whoever prays a thousand aayaat in qiyaam will be recorded as one of the muqantareen (those who pile up good deeds). (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ibn Hibbaan. It is a hasan report. Saheeh al-Targheeb, 635). Yahyaa ibn Muaadh said: The medicine of the heart is five things: reading Quraan and pondering the meaning, having an empty stomach, praying at night (qiyaam al-layl), beseeching Allaah at the time of suhoor, and keeping company with righteous people. 4 Studying how the salaf and righteous people practised qiyaam al-layl and adhered to it. The salaf used to enjoy qiyaam al-layl and rejoice greatly in doing it. Abd-Allaah ibn Wahb said: Every type of pleasure is enjoyed only once, except for acts of worship, which are enjoyed three times: when you do it, when you remember it, and when you are given the reward for it. Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: There is nothing left of the joys of this life except three: qiyaam al-layl, meeting ones brothers in faith, and praying in congregation. Thaabit al-Banaani said: There is nothing I enjoy more than qiyaam al-layl. Yazeed al-Riqaashi said: A lot of tahajjud brings delight to the worshippers, and a lot of thirst (i.e., fasting), brings joy when they meet Allaah. Mukhallad ibn Husayn said: I never woke up at night except I saw Ibraaheem ibn Adham remembering Allaah and praying, and this made me depressed, so I consoled myself with this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): That is the Grace of Allaah which He bestows on whom He pleases. And Allaah is the Owner of Great Bounty [al-Hadeed 57:21]. Abu Aasim al-Nabeel said: Abu Haneefah used to be called al-Watad (pole or pillar) because he prayed so much. Al-Qaasim ibn Maeen said: Abu Haneefah spent an entire night in qiyaam reciting this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter [al-Qamar 54:46], repeating it and weeping, beseeching Allaah until morning came. Ibraaheem ibn Shammaas said: I used to see Ahmad ibn Hanbal staying up at night to pray when he was a young man. Abu Bakr al-Marwadhi said: I was with Imaam Ahmad for nearly four months in the army, and he never stopped praying qiyaam at night or reading Quraan during the day, and I never knew when he completed the Quraan, because he kept that secret. Imaam al-Bukhaari used to pray qiyaam and tahajjud at night until the time of suhoor, and he would read between a half and a third of the Quraan, and complete it at suhoor every third night. Al-Allaamah Ibn Abd al-Haadi said, describing the qiyaam of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah: At night he would keep away from people, and spend that time only with his Lord, beseeching Him continually and reciting Quraan, repeating different kinds of acts of worship by night and by day. When he began to pray, his body would start to tremble, leaning to the left and right. Ibn Rajab said concerning his shaykh Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim: He was a man of worship, tahajjud and lengthy prayers. I have never seen his equal in worship and knowledge of the Quraan, hadeeth and principles of faith. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said, describing his shaykh al-Haafiz al-Iraaqi: I stayed with him, and I never saw him forsake qiyaam al-layl: it was like a habit for him. 5 Sleeping on ones right side. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his ummah (followers)to sleep on their right sides, as is reported in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When any one of you goes to bed, let him clear his bed by hitting it with his garment, for he does not know what may have come onto it. Then let him lie down on his right side, then let him say, Bismika Rabbi wadatu janbi wa bika arfauhu. In amsakta nafsi farhamhaa wa in arsaltahaa fahfazhaa bimaa tahfazu bihi ibaadaka al-saaliheen (In Your Name, my Lord, I lay myself down and I get up again. If You take my soul, then have mercy on it, and if You send it back to me, then protect it with that with which You protect Your righteous slaves). (Agreed upon). Al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When you want to go to bed, do wudoo as for prayer, then lie down on your right side. (Agreed upon) Hafsah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to bed, he would put his right hand under his right cheek. (Reported by al-Tabaraani, Saheeh al-Jaami, 4523). Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: There is a reason for his lying on his right side, which is that the heart is located on the left, so if a person lays on his left side, he will sleep too deeply, because the hearts position will be too comfortable, but if he sleeps on his right side, he will not be too settled, so he wont sleep deeply. 6 Sleeping in a state of tahaarah (purity). We have already quoted the hadeeth of al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, When you go to bed, do wudoo as if for prayer. (Agreed upon). Muaad ibn Jabal (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is no Muslim who goes to sleep remembering Allaah and in a state of purity, and when he turns over he asks Allaah for good in this world and the next, but it will be given to him. (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. Saheeh al-Jaami, 5754). Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Purify these bodies and Allaah will purify you, for there is no slave who goes to sleep in a state of purity but an angel spends the night with him, and every time he turns over, [the angel] says, O Allaah, forgive Your slave, for he went to bed in a state of purity. (Reported by al-Tabaraani. Al-Mundhiri said, its isnaad is jaayid. Saheeh al-Jaami, 3831). 7 Going to sleep early. Sleeping straight after Ishaa is the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and a good and healthy habit. One of the ahaadeeth that describe its virtues was narrated by Abu Barzah al-Aslami (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to prefer to delay Ishaa, and he did not like to sleep before it or talk after it. (Reported by al-Bukhaari). Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar reported that al-Qaadi Ayaad said, concerning the phrase He did not like to sleep before it: Because that could lead to one praying it too late, or delaying it until after the preferred time, and talking after it could lead to one sleeping before Fajr and missing it, or missing qiyaam al-layl. Ibn Raafi said: Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to wave his stick at the people when darkness fell, and would say, Get up and go, may Allaah help you to pray qiyaam at night! Another matter that has to do with sleep is choosing a suitable bed, not one that is excessively luxurious or soft, because that makes a person sleep too much and become negligent, and causes laziness and carelessness. Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The pillow of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) on which he slept at night was made of leather stuffed with palm fibres. (Reported by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. Saheeh al-Jaami, 4714). Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that Umar ibn al-Khattaab entered upon the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was lying on a mat of palm fibres that had left marks on his side. Umar said, O Messenger of Allaah, why do you not get something more comfortable than this? He (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: What do I have to do with this world? My relationship with this world is like that of a traveller on a hot summers day, who seeks shade under a tree for an hour, then moves on. (Reported by Ahmad and al-Haakim. Saheeh al-Jaami, 5545). Ali ibn Bakkaar (may Allaah have mercy on him) used to have a slave-woman who would spread out his bed for him, and he would touch it with his hand and say: By Allaah, you are good, and by Allaah you are cool, but by Allaah I will not rest on you tonight. Then he would get up and pray qiyaam until Fajr. Also, one should not sleep too much or too deeply. Ibraaheem ibn Adham said: If you are sleeping at night, and running about during the day, and always committing sin, how can you earn the pleasure of the One Who is directing your affairs? 8 Having the habit of reciting adhkaar (words of remembrance of Allah) prescribed by shareeah (Islamic law) before going to sleep, because these adhkaar are like a fortress which protects a person from the Shaytaan, by the permission of Allaah, and helps him to get up for qiyaam. Among these adhkaar is that mentioned in the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When any one of you goes to bed, let him clear his bed by hitting it with his garment, for he does not know what may have come onto it. Then let him lie down on his right side, then let him say, Bismika Rabbi wadatu janbi wa bika arfauhu. In amsakta nafsi farhamhaa wa in arsaltahaa fahfazhaa bimaa tahfazu bihi ibaadaka al-saaliheen (In Your Name, my Lord, I lay myself down and I get up again. If You take my soul, then have mercy on it, and if You send it back to me, then protect it with that with which You protect Your righteous slaves). (Agreed upon). Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to bed each night, he would put his palms together, blow in them, and recite Qul huwa Allaahu ahad, Qul aoodhu bi Rabbil-Falaq and Qul aoodhu bi Rabbil-Naas, then he would wipe as much of his body as he could with his hands, starting with his head and face, and the front of his body, doing this three times. (Agreed upon). Ibn Masood (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever recites the last two aayahs of Soorat al-Baqarah, this will take care of him. (Agreed upon). Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to bed, he would say: Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi atamanaa wa saqaanaa, wa kafaanaa fa kam mimman laa kaafeeya lahu wa laa muweeya lahu (Praise be to Allaah Who has fed us and given us to drink, and Who has given us enough, for how many are there who have no-one to suffice them or give them refuge). (Reported by Muslim). According to the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah in which he tells the story of how he captured the Shaytaan, the Shaytaan said to him: When you go to bed, recite Aayat al-Kursi, Allaah! None has the right to be worshipped but He, the Ever-Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists [al-Baqarah 2:255 interpretation of the meaning] until the end of it, because it will bring Allaahs protection for you, and no shaytaan (devil) will approach you until morning comes. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) mentioned this to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he said, He spoke the truth even though he is a liar. (Agreed upon). Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that when the Prophets daughter Faatimah (may Allaah be pleased with her) came to him and asked him for a servant, he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to her and Ali: Shall I not teach you something that will be better for you than a servant? When you go to bed, say Subhaan Allaah thirty-three times, al-hamdu Lillaah thirty-three times, and Allaahu akbar thirty-four times. This is better for you than a servant. (Agreed upon). Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Recite Qul yaa ayyuhal-kaafiroon when you go to sleep, for it is a renunciation of shirk. (polytheism) (Reported by al-Bayhaqi. Saheeh al-Jaami, 1172). Hafsah (may Allaah be pleased with her) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to bed, he would put his right hand under his right cheek and say: Rabbi qinee adhaabaka yawma tabathu ibaadaka (My Lord, save me from Your punishment on the Day when You resurrect Your slaves). (Reported by Abu Dawood, Saheeh al-Jaami, 4532). Al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When you go to bed, do wudoo as if for prayer, then lie down on your right side, then say: Allaahummah aslamtu nafsi ilayk, wa wajahtu wajhi ilayk, wa fawwadtu amri ilayk, wa aljatu zahri ilayk, raghbatan wa rahbatan ilayk, laa maljaa wa laa manjaa minka illa ilayk. Aamantu bi kitaabik alladhi anzalt, wa bi nabiyyik alladhi arsalt (O Allaah, I submit myself to You, I turn my face to You, I delegate my affairs to You and I rely totally on You, out of fear and hope of You. There is no refuge or sanctuary from You except in You. I believe in Your Book which You have revealed and in Your Prophet whom You have sent). Then if you die, you will have died on the fitrah, (natural state) , so make these the last words you speak.” (Agreed upon). Similarly, the Muslim should have the habit of reciting adhkaar prescribed by shareeah when waking up, such as that reported by Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When any one of you wakes up, he should say: Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi radda alayya roohi, wa aafaani fi jasadi wa adhina li bi dhikrihi (Praise be to Allaah Who has restored my soul, given health to my body, and allowed me to remember Him). (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and al-Nisaa'i, Saheeh al-Jaami, 326). Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever turns over at night and says Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah wahdahu laa shareeka lah, lahul-mulk wa lahul-hamd wa huwa al kulli shayin qadeer. Al-hamdulillahi, subhaan Allaah wa laa illaaha ill-Allaah wa Allaahu akbar wa laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billaah (There is no god but Allaah Alone, with no partner or associate. His is the Dominion and the Praise, and He is Able to do all things. Praise be to Allaah, glory be to Allaah. There is no god except Allaah, Allaah is Most Great and there is no strength and no power except in Allaah), then says, Allaahumma ghfir li (O Allaah, forgive me), or some other duaa, it will be answered, and if he does wudoo and then prays, his prayer will be accepted. (Reported by al-Bukhaari) Imaam Ibn Battaal said: Allaah has promised through His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that whoever wakes up from his sleep pronouncing words of Tawheed, submitting to His sovereignty, recognizing His blessings by praising Him, exalting Him above that which does not befit Him by glorifying Him (saying Subhaan Allaah), submitting to Him by magnifying Him (saying Allaahu akbar) and admitting ones utter dependence upon His help, then if he makes duaa it will be answered, and if he prays his prayer will be accepted. Everyone who hears this hadeeth should apply it and make the most of it, and make his intention sincerely for his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Al-Baraa ibn Aazib (may Allaah be pleased with them both) said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) woke up, he would say: Al-hamdu Lillaah illadhi ahyaanaa bada maa amaatanaa wa ilayhi al-nushoor (Praise be to Allaah Who has brought us back to life after having caused us to die, and unto Him is the resurrection). (Reported by Muslim). Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them both) reported that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) woke up he would wipe the sleep from his face with his hand, then look at the sky and recite the final ten aayaat of Soorat Aal Imran: Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth [Aal Imraan 3:190 interpretation of the meaning]. (Reported by Muslim) Imaam al-Nawawi said: This indicates that it is mustahabb (recommended) to wipe away the traces of sleep from ones face, and to recite these aayaat when getting up from sleep. 9 Being keen to take a nap or siesta during the day, whether before zuhr or after. Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Take a nap, for the shayaateen do not take naps. (Reported by al-Tabaraani. Al-Saheehah, 2647). Ishaaq ibn Abd-Allaah said: Taking a nap is one of the deeds of good people. It revitalizes the heart and helps one to pray qiyaam al-layl. Al-Hasan al-Basri passed by a group of people in the marketplace in the middle of the day, and heard the racket they were making. He said, Do these people take a nap? It was said to him, No. He said, I think their nights must be bad. 10 Avoiding eating or drinking too much. Eating and drinking too much are two of the main obstacles that prevent people from praying qiyaam al-layl. Al-Miqdaam ibn Mad Yakrib (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Man fills no vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to have a few mouthfuls to give him the strength he needs. If he has to fill his stomach, then let him leave one-third for food, one-third for drink and one-third for air. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah. Saheeh al-Jaami, 5674). Abu Juhayfah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to a man who burped in his presence: Stop your burping, for the people who eat the most in this life will be the most hungry on the Day of Resurrection. (Reported by al-Haakim. Saheeh al-Jaami, 1190). Sufyaan al-Thawri said: You should eat little, so that you will be able to pray qiyaam al-layl. Maqal ibn Habeeb saw some people eating a lot, and said, I do not think that our companions want to pray qiyaam al-layl. Wahb ibn Munabbih said: There is no son of Adam dearer to his shaytaan than the one who eats and sleeps a lot. 11 Striving against oneself to pray qiyaam al-layl. This is one of the best means of helping oneself to pray qiyaam, because human nature is inclined towards wrongdoing, so the one who follows his own inclinations will be led to doom and destruction. Allaah has commanded us to strive against our own selves, as He says (interpretation of the meanings): And strive hard in Allaahs Cause as you ought to strive [al-Hajj 22:78] And as for those who strive hard in Our Cause, We will surely guide them to Our Paths. And verily, Allaah is with the muhsinoon (good-doers). [al-Ankaboot 29:69] Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (charity in Allaahs Cause) out of what We have bestowed on them [al-Sajdah 32:16] Fadaalah ibn Ubayd (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The mujaahid (warrior) is the one who strives against his own self for the sake of Allaah. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibbaan. Al-Saheehah, 549). According to the hadeeth of Uqbah ibn Aamir (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When a man from my ummah gets up to pray at night, striving against his own self to get up and purify himself, there are knots on him. When he washes his hands in wudoo, one knot is undone. When he washes his face, another knot is undone. When he wipes his head another knot is undone. When he washes his feet, another knot is undone. Then Allaah says to those who are veiled (in the Unseen): Look at this slave of Mine, he is striving against his own self and asking of Me. Whatever My slave asks of Me shall be his. (Reported by Ahmad and Ibn Hibaan. Saheeh al-Targheeb, 627). Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir said: I struggled against my own self for forty years until it became right. Thaabit al-Banaani said: I struggled for twenty years to make myself pray qiyaam al-layl, and I enjoyed it (qiyaam al-layl) for twenty years. Umar ibn Abd al-Azeez said: The best of deeds are those which we force ourselves to do. Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak said: The souls of righteous people in the past used to push them to do good deeds, but our souls do not do what we want them to do except by force, so we have to force them. Qutaadah said: O son of Adam, if you do not want to do any good except when you have the energy for it, then your nature is more inclined towards boredom and laziness. The true believer is the one who pushes himself. 12 Avoiding sin. If the Muslim wants to be one of those who earn the honour of speaking to Allaah in the depths of the night, let him beware of sin, for the one who is contaminated with the stain of sin will not be helped to pray qiyaam al-layl. A man said to Ibraaheem ibn Adham, I cannot pray qiyaam al-layl, so tell me the cure for this. He said, Do not commit sin during the day, and He will help you to stand before Him at night, for your standing before Him at night is one of the greatest honours, and the sinner does not deserve that honour. A man said to al-Hasan al-Basri: O Abu Saeed, I sleep in good health, and I love to pray qiyaam al-layl, and I prepare water with which to purify myself, so why can I not get up? Al-Hasan said: Your sins are restricting you. He said, may Allaah have mercy on him, The slave who commits a sin will be denied the opportunity to pray qiyaam at night and to fast during the day. Al-Fudayl ibn Ayaad said: If you cannot pray qiyaam al-layl, or fast during the day, know that you are indeed deprived and restricted, chained by your sins. 13 Checking oneself and rebuking oneself for not praying qiyaam al-layl. Checking oneself is one of the signs of the righteous and truthful. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Fear Allaah and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow, and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is All-Aware of what you do. [al-Hashr 59:18]. Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim said: If the slave is responsible and accountable for everything, even his hearing, sight and innermost thoughts, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning), Verily, the hearing, and the sight, and the heart of each of you will be questioned by Allaah [al-Isra 17:36], then he should check on himself before he is brought to account. Qiyaam al-layl is an act of worship that connects the heart to Allaah, may He be exalted, and enables it to overcome the temptations of life and to strive against ones own self, at the time when voices are stilled, eyes are closed in sleep, and sleepers are tossing and turning in their beds. Therefore qiyaam al-layl is one of the measures of sincere determination and one of the qualities of those who have great ambitions. Allaah has praised them and distinguished them from others in the Quraan, where He says (interpretation of the meaning): Is one who is obedient to Allaah, prostrating himself or standing (in prayer) during the hours of the night, fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the Mercy of his Lord (like one who disbelieves)? Say: Are those who know equal to those who know not? It is only men of understanding who will remember. [al-Zumar 39:9] Qiyaam al-layl is sunnah muakkadah (confirmed Sunnah), which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) urged us to do when he said, You should pray qiyaam al-layl, for it is the habit of the righteous people who came before you, and it will bring you closer to your Lord, expiate for bad deeds, prevent sin, and expel disease from the body. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and Ahmad). According to a hadeeth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The best of prayers after the prescribed prayers is qiyaam al-layl. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) always had the habit of praying qiyaam al-layl, and never gave it up, whether he was travelling or staying at home. Even though he, among all the sons of Adam, would be the one to have all his past and future sins forgiven, he prayed qiyaam al-layl until his feet became swollen, and when he was asked about that, he said, Should I not be a grateful slave? (Agreed upon). This is how the noble salaf were, may Allaah have mercy upon them. Abul-Darda (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: Pray two rakahs in the darkness of the night for the darkness of the grave. Ahmad ibn Harb said: I am astonished at people who know that the delights of Paradise lie above them and the horrors of Hell lie beneath them. How can they sleep in between them? When Umar ibn Dharr saw that night had come, he would say: Night has come, and night has dignity, and Allaah is most deserving of reverence. For this reason, al-Fudayl ibn Ayaad said: I met some people who feel ashamed before Allaah to sleep for too long in the depths of the night. Such a person may be resting on his side, and when he moves, he says to himself, This is not your right. Get up and take your share of the Hereafter. Al-Hasan said: We do not know of any deed more difficult than the struggle to stay up at night or to spend money. It was said to him, Why do the mutahajjadeen (those who pray Tahajjud at night) have the most beautiful faces? He said, Because they spend time alone with the Most Merciful, so He adorns them with some of His light. The women of the salaf also used to strive to pray qiyaam al-layl with energy and determination. Where are the women of our own age when it comes to such great deeds? Urwah ibn al-Zubayr said: I came to Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) one day to greet her, and I found her praying and reciting the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), But Allaah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire [al-Toor 52:27], repeating it and weeping. I waited for her, but I got bored of waiting, so I went to the market for some things I needed, then I came back to Aaishah, and she was still praying and reciting this aayah and weeping. Anas ibn Maalik (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Jibreel said to me, Go back to Hafsah, for she fasts a lot and prays a lot at night (qiyaam al-layl). (Reported by al-Haakim, Saheeh al-Jaami, 4227). Muaadhah al-Adawiyyah, one of the righteous Taabiaat (successors of the companions of the Prophet) spent her wedding night, along with her husband Silah ibn Ashyam, praying until Fajr. When her husband and son were killed in the land of jihaad (battle), she would spend the whole night in prayer, worshipping and beseeching Allaah, and she would sleep during the day. If she felt sleepy whilst she was praying at night, she would tell herself: O soul, there is plenty of sleep ahead of you. When Habeebah al-Adawiyyah prayed Ishaa, she would stand on the roof of her house, wearing her chemise and khimaar (i.e., covered in proper Islamic dress), then she would say, O my God, the stars have come out, people have gone to sleep, and kings have closed their doors, but Your door is open. Every lover is alone with his lover, but here I am standing before You. Then she would start to pray and talk to her Lord until the time of suhoor. When the time of suhoor came, she would say, O Allaah, this night is ending, the day is coming, and I wish I knew whether you have accepted this night (of worship) from me, so that I could congratulate myself, or if it has been rejected, so that I might console myself. Amrah, the wife of Habeeb al-Ajami, prayed qiyaam al-layl one night whilst her husband was asleep. When the time for suhoor came, and her husband was still asleep, she woke him up and said to him, Get up, my master, for the night has gone, the day has come and ahead of you lies a long road with little provision, and a small group of righteous people who have gone before us, and we are still here. We ask Allaah to help us to remember Him, to thank Him and to worship Him properly. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard something that pleased him, he would say: Allaahu akbar, Allaahumma la aysha ila aysh al-aakhirah (Allaah is most great, O Allaah, there is no real life except the life of the Hereafter). (Narrated by Ahmad). So it is permissible for a man to say Allaahu akbar when he sees something that makes him glad, and he can raise his voice, without going to extremes. But congergational Takbeer, where everyone starts and ends at the same time, is not prescribed in Islam, because there is no report to indicate that. But if one person says Takbeer, then another and another joins in, and they happen to say it at the same time, without prior agreement, then there is nothing wrong with this. They can also prostrate (sajdat al-shukr the prostration of thanksgiving) if it is a serious matter. And Allaah is the Source of help.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.In order to answer this question, we must shed light on three things: we must point out the importance of avoiding sectarianism in following any school of thought, whether it has to do with fiqh, thought or anything else. We should get into the habit of following the Quraan and Sunnah and letting them be our guide. There is such a thing as the inclination to follow one of the opinions of the fuqaha, not on the basis of Tarjeeh (weighing and comparing evidence) but because of a desire to follow the easiest way or because it suits one's own desires. A person may find some justification for motives that he thinks are correct, and does not realize they are wrong until later on. Therefore one should only select or give preference to an opinion either by studying the matter and examining the evidence and proofs offered by all sides, which should be done by one who has sound knowledge, or else by following a scholar who is well known to be knowledgeable, religious, pious and righteous, so that one feels confident of his sincerity and wide knowledge. Keeping the peace in the marital home is more important than disputing as to whose opinion or madhhab should prevail, so long as the issue in question is one in which differences of opinion are permissible and every opinion has some grounds for validity. At the same time, it should be pointed out to the husband, gently and calmly, that it is important to base ones opinions on sound evidence, and that not every scholarly opinion or madhhab is always correct. The scholars themselves said that their opinions should be discounted if they contradicted well known evidence, as al-Shaafai said: If my opinion contradicts a hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), cast it aside (lit. throw it against the wall). If you and your husband are not students of shareeah with a firm grounding of knowledge, then you have to refer to one of the scholars and follow his opinions. If you agree on a scholar you can both refer to him, and if your husband chooses someone according to what he thinks is best and you choose someone else, there is nothing wrong with that. Each of you can follow his or her scholar in matters that do not affect the other, but in matters where the husband has authority or responsibility, the opinion of the scholar whom your husband is following should prevail. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If a husband is fulfilling his Islamic duties towards his wife, it is not permissible for her to ask him for a divorce, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If any woman asks her husband for a divorce for no compelling reason, she will be deprived of the fragrance of Paradise.” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 21874, and Ibn Maajah, 2055). The meaning of the phrase “for no compelling reason” is anything that gives her a strong motive for seeking divorce. (Sharh Ibn Maajah ‘ala al-Sanadi). As for intercourse in bed, if the wife’s demands are greater than what is normal, it is not permissible for her to seek a divorce (the word “normal” refers to what is usual, such as once a week or once every ten days and so on, and people vary in their capacity in this regard). For more information, please see Question # 1078. If the husband has some defect or sickness that prevents him from having intercourse (i.e., he is impotent), then it is permissible for his wife to ask for a divorce. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.You should know, my brother, that the most essential thing for any person is his commitment to Islam and his faith, and he will not be harmed by whatever he misses out on of worldly things if Allaah keeps his religion safe. Allaah is the King of kings and is the One Who moves the heart; He Alone is the One Who strengthens the heart and makes it steadfast. For this reason I advise you, my brother, to turn to Allaah, for He is a loving and merciful Lord Who is Compassionate towards His slaves. If you turn to Him sincerely and pray with true longing and ask Him to strengthen your faith and protect you from the evil of the whispers of your own soul and of the Shaytaan, then Allaah is Close and responds to the prayers of those who call on Him. Do not forget this important fact, for it is a source of relief and a way out from your problem, in sha Allaah. I would also like to remind you of the virtues of reading Quraan and reciting a lot of duaas, morning and evening, for this will have a great effect in bringing peace and comfort to your heart. Avoid the things that will make you feel far away from Allaah and bring you closer to the Shaytaan and his whispers. One of these things is what you mention in your question, namely looking at pornography and so on, because if a person persists in sin, it piles up in his heart until it is overwhelmed with darkness and is not affected by any exhortation or preaching. So hasten to repent from this sin and others, and fulfil the conditions of repentance properly. We also advise you to avoid sitting with bad company and in gatherings that could increase your confusion or provoke your desires; look for good people and keep company with them, because a man will be on the religion of his friend. It seems from your question that you are suffering from a specific psychological problem, either financial or social or otherwise, and this is having an effect on this waswaas (insinuating thoughts from Shaytaan) that you are suffering. If this is indeed the case, we advise you to treat this problem quickly, because this may be a way of dealing with what you are suffering from. We will help you as much as we can, in sha Allaah. What you are going through might be a kind of depression or anxiety, for one reason or another. You know that Allaah has not created a disease without also creating the cure. It is known that there are medicines that may be of help, by the grace of Allaah, in treating this kind of sickness. So ask about this kind of medication from a psychiatrist.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Ibn Hazam (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his book Al-Muhallaa bi’l-Aathaar, 317: “… It is not permissible for a woman to lead a man or men in prayer, and there is no dispute on this matter. Also, it has been reported that a woman invalidates a man’s prayer if she passes in front of him, which we will discuss further in a later chapter, in sha Allaah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said, “The imaam is a protection (or a shield),” and ruled that (women) should definitely be behind men in prayer. The imaam should stand in front of the congregation or with them in the same row, as we have already mentioned. From these texts it is clear that it is not correct for a woman to lead a man or men in prayers.” (al-Muhallaa, part 2, Salaat al-Jamaa’ah). ‘Ali ibn Sulaymaan al-Mardaawi al-Hanbali (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: “With regard to his saying ‘It is not right for a woman to lead a man in prayer’, and this applies whatever the case.” (Al-Insaaf, part 2, Baab Salaat al-Jamaa’ah).

      "Praise be to Allah. Adhkar al-sabah (supplications recited in the morning) are not connected only to the time when the sun rises; in Arabic the word subh (morning) applies to dawn and the first part of the day, as is stated in al-Qamoos al-Muheet, 291 [a famous Arabic language dictionary – Translator]. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and celebrate the praises of your Lord in the evening and in the morning.” [Ghafir 40:55 – Yusuf ‘Ali’s translation] Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (exegesis) (4/86) that this means in the early part of the day and in the early part of the night. But the best time of the day for making dhikr (reciting words of remembrance) is after the dawn prayer, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting…” [Taha 20:130] And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever prays Fajr in congregation, then sits and remembers Allah (makes dhikr) until the sun rises, then prays two rak’ahs (units of prayer), will have a reward like that for Hajj and ‘Umrah (major and minor Pilgrimage), complete, complete, complete.” (Saheeh al-Jami’, 6222). Based on the above, this is how we understand the reports narrated on this topic, such as the hadeeths (narrations): “Whoever says, in the morning and the evening, ‘Subhan Allahi wa bi hamdih (Glory and praise be to Allah)’ one hundred times, will not come with anything better than it on the Day of Resurrection, except for one who does likewise or does more.” (Reported by Muslim, 2692). “Allahumma bika asbahna wa bika amsayna wa bika nahya wa bika namoot wa ilayka al-nushoor (O Allah, by Your blessings we reach the morning, by Your blessings we reach the evening, by Your blessings we live, by Your blessings we die, and unto You is the Resurrection).” (Reported by Abu Dawood in al-Sunan, no. (5068); al-Nasai in al-Sunan al-Kubra (9836). Al-Albani said it is a saheeh hadeeth/authentic narration). Therefore, you can say adhkar al-sabah when you wake up from sleeping, because it is still the time of subh (morning). And Allah is the Source of strength. Note: Muslim reported in his Saheeh (no. 747) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever sleeps without doing his regular dhikr or part of it, then recites it during the time between the Fajr prayer and Zuhr prayer, it will be recorded as if he had recited it at night.” In Sharh Muslim (6/27), al-Nawawi said: “This indicates that it is mustahabb (liked, preferred), to recite awrad (dhikr, supplications) regularly, and that if one misses it, one can make it up later.” In ‘Awn al-Ma’bood (4/198) it says: “This hadeeth indicates that it is permissible to recite wird regularly at night, and that it is permissible to make it up if one misses it because of sleeping or any other reason. It also indicates that the one who does this between the Fajr prayer and Zuhr prayer is like the one who does it at night, so it is mustahabb to make up tahajjud if one misses it at night.” And Allah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Human societies have known all kinds of class systems. In some societies there is a class of princes, a class of warriors, a class of farmers and a class of slaves, and based on this there is a lot of oppression, abuse and trampling on people’s rights. But the sharee’ah or law of Allaah does not recognize such systems at all. Islam gives equal rights to all, rich and poor, noble and ignoble. The basic principle on which people are differentiated in Islam is mentioned in the Holy Qur’aan, in Soorat al-Hujuraat (interpretation of the meaning): “O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has al-taqwa [i.e., is one of the muttaqoon or pious]. Verily, Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware” [al-Hujuraat 49:13] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “O people! Verily your Lord is One and your father [Adam] is one. An Arab is no better than a non-Arab, and a non-Arab is no better than an Arab; a red man is no better than a black man and a black man is no better than a red man – except if it is in terms of taqwa (piety)…” (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 22391; al-Silsilat al-Saheeh, 2700). This is the principle on which society is based in Islam. This is the global human society which mankind is trying to attain through its far-fetched ideas, but is failing to do so, because they are not following the one straight path that will lead them there, the way to God, may He be glorified, and because they are not standing under the one banner that could unite them, the banner of God, may He be exalted. People live on this earth connected by all kinds of relationships, all of which carry some weight or have some attraction in their lives… these include lineage, power, wealth, etc. From these stem other connections, practical, economic, etc., where people have different positions and levels of status with regard to one another. So some people have more status than others in worldly terms… Then Islam comes and says: “the most honourable of you with Allaah [God] is that (believer) who has al-taqwa [i.e., is one of the muttaqoon or pious]” so it ignores all the values that carry weight in people’s lives, and replaces them all with this new value that is derived directly from the Revelation and is the only one that is recognized in the standards of God. This is piety and consciousness of God, which is manifested in the worship of God lone, with no partner, no son, no equal… obeying what He commands and avoiding what He forbids, seeking His pleasure and Paradise, and fearing His punishment and Hell-fire.

      "Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen: One of the Sunnahs with regard to marriage is that it should be announced publicly, with beating on the daff or hand-drum (i.e., celebrations), so as to distinguish it from fornication, which usually happens in secret. If the marriage contract has been drawn up in accordance with all the requisite conditions, then it is valid even if the family does not accept it. The issue of kafaaah or compatibility has to do with religious commitment, as Allaah has explained in His Book. A Muslim man can marry a Muslim woman, or a woman of the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) on the condition that she is chaste, but he is not permitted to marry a mushrikah (polytheist woman) or a zaaniyah (woman who commits adultery or fornication). He should, however, try to find a woman who is strongly committed to Islam. A Muslim woman is not permitted to marry anyone except a Muslim man. A man of the People of the Book does not qualify in terms of compatibility with her, and she should look for someone who is known among the Muslims to be committed to Islam and of good character. With regard to the situation described in the question, we may note the following points: The husband does not have to divorce his wife if his father asks him to do so. The fathers rights are great indeed, and good treatment of one's family is a duty. If your father is suffering from heart disease, it is better if he does not know about this marriage. It is unlikely that his attitude has changed because it is based on the class/caste system and it is not easy for seniors to change their beliefs. You have to make sure you understand your familys current attitude and to what extent they are prepared to accept your marriage to this woman. Perhaps they have heard that she has got married, and they think that she has married someone else, so they want to make you feel better (by saying they would accept her because she now seems to be safely out of the picture). Or perhaps they have heard that she has got married to you and they want to hear about it from you. Once you are sure that they have changed their attitude for real, there is nothing to stop you asking for permission from them and from your father to get married. If they give you permission, then this is what you want; if they do not, then just stay as you are now, so that no bad consequences will come to them as a result of them knowing about your marriage. As far as repeating your marriage contract is concerned, we put this question to the Mufti Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Abd-Allaah ibn Baaz, who replied with the conclusion that if the first contract met all the requisite conditions, and there are no impediments, then it is a valid contract. It should not be repeated lest that open the way to playing about with it. You should strive to please your family in every way you can and tell them that the matter has been concluded in an appropriate fashion. If there is genuine cause to fear for your fathers life, then it could be said that repeating the contract could be done on the grounds of necessity. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Can a husband see his wife's private parts? Can husband and wife bathe together? Praise be to Allah.Can a husband see his wife's private parts? It is permissible for a woman to see all of her husband’s body and for a man to see all of his wife’s body, with no need to go into details, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “And those who guard their chastity (i.e., private parts, from illegal sexual acts), except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame; but whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.” [al-Muminun 23:5-7] (Fatawa al-Mar’ah by Ibn ‘Uthaymin, 121) Can husband and wife bathe together? Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih (no. 250) that ‘Aishah said: “The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and I used to bathe from one vessel.” Al-Hafiz said in al-Fath: “Al-Dawudi interpreted this to mean that it is permissible for a man to look at his wife’s ‘awrah and vice-versa. This is supported by the report narrated by Ibn Hibban via Sulayman ibn Musa, who was asked about a man looking at his wife’s private parts. He said: ‘I asked ‘Aishah, and she referred to this hadith.’ This is evidence in this matter. And Allah knows best.” I say: as for the words that some people attribute to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), that it is makruh (disliked) for a man to look at his wife’s private parts, this is not sahih. This includes the reports narrated from Ibn 'Abbas and Abu Hurayrah according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “When any one of you has intercourse with his wife , let him not look at her private parts, because this causes blindness, and let him not speak, because this causes muteness.” Ibn al-Jawzi said: “(This is) mawdu’ (fabricated).” (See al-Mawdu’at by Ibn al-Jawzi, 2/271-272).

      "Praise be to Allah.It is true what you have said, that wrong is wrong. In Islam, pre-marriage relationships are not permissible. We believe that adultery is not permissible not only in Islam, but also in all religions of Allah (God). I believe that the gentleman of nationality Xyz whom you are seeing is not serious in getting married, because if he were, he would have married you from the very beginning. In Islam, a man must respect the will of his parents, and in some cases he must obey them. You, in your present status, are not a member of his family. When you become his wife, then you are considered to be his family. Yet even then, if a father orders his son to divorce his wife because, for example, she has bad reputation or she is not a good Muslim, he must obey his father. My advice to you is to think seriously in embracing Islam, not for the sake of this man, but for the salvation of your soul and body from Hellfire. I believe by now, you have a good idea what Islam is, putting aside the bad example this gentleman has been setting. Therefor, you should stop seeing this man and you should become Muslim. If his love to you is genuine, he will propose to you. If he doesnt, then be sure that Allah will not leave you alone, and as He guided you to his religion, He will send you a good Muslim who will cherish you and give you a decent life as a wife not as a mistress. I pray to Allah that He may enlighten your heart with Islam and guide you to make the right choice.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.With regard to the question of marriage, if you have any authority or influence over your brother and can convince him to give up the idea of marrying this woman, then remember that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded the Muslim to marry the woman who is religious. This woman is sinful and goes against the religion, she is not modest in her dress and she drinks wine, so he should not marry this woman. With regard to the issue of his disobedience towards his parents, this sin is more serious than the one mentioned above. They have told him to obey Allah and to keep away from sin, so he must obey them and avoid going against their wishes. Your familys rejection of this marriage is quite correct according to shareeah, because they are enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and seeking to control one who is insane. It is permissible, indeed it is necessary, to forsake him if doing so will stop him from going ahead, because marriage to this woman will keep him away from his religion. In America and in other kaafir countries there are many individuals in the Indian, Pakistani and Arab communities who have forsaken their religion and are no longer Muslim in anything but name. As regards depriving him of his inheritance, this should not be done unless he becomes an apostate (leaves Islam). So long as he is within the pale of Islam, and does not do anything to put him outside of Islam or to make him a kaafir, then it is not permissible to deprive him of his inheritance, because this is something prescribed by Allaah, and as such it is not permissible to change it. And Allaah knows best,\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.When a woman prays behind an imaam, it is not essential for her to see him or some of the people who are praying behind him, but the rows have to be straight and the women who are praying should be within the boundaries of the mosque and be able to hear the voice of the imaam, so that they can follow him. If women are unable to hear the imaams voice for some reason, then they should pray individually, or in a jamaaah with other women, if they cannot hear the imaams voice or follow him. If a woman enters the mosque and hears the imaam saying takbeer, she should not follow him in saying takbeer until she knows whether he is in sujood or rukoo etc. The way out of this dilemma if she cannot see the imaam or any members of the congregation is to wait until the imaam says sami Allaahu liman hamidah, then she can pray with him. Ibn Abd al-Barr said in al-Kaafi (1/212): Everyone who can see or hear the imaam, and knows where he is in the prayer, and is behind him, it is permissible for him to follow him in prayer. This is the Maaliki view. And Ibn Qudaamah said: If there is a barrier between the imaam and the person who is following him, which prevents him from seeing the imaam or the people praying behind him, then there are two views narrated from Ahmad, one of which says that it is not valid for him to pray behind him and the second view is: it is valid because he can follow the imaam without seeing him, as a blind person does. But for his following the imaam to be valid, he has to be able to hear him. (al-Mughni, 2/208) In conclusion, if you are inside the mosque and you can hear the imaams voice and you know where he is in the prayer, then follow him, otherwise pray by yourself or with a group of women after the imaam finishes the prayer. With regard to whether your prayer is valid or not, we asked Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen, and he replied that to be on the safe side you should repeat the prayer. And Allaah is the source of strength.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah. There is no doubt that man suffers psychological diseases, such as anxiety about the future and grief for the past. Psychological diseases may have a greater impact on the body than physical diseases. Treating these diseases by means of something prescribed in sharee’ah – i.e., ruqyah – is more successful than treating them by means of physical medicines, as is well known. Among the means of treating them: the saheeh haseeth narrated from Ibn Mas’ood (may Allaah be pleased with him): “There is no believer who is stricken by anxiety, distress or grief, and he says, ‘Allaahumma inni ‘abduka ibnu ‘abdika ibnu amatika, naasiyati bi yadika, maadin fiyya hukmuka, ‘adlun fiyya qadaa’uka, as’aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw ‘allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta’tharta bihi fi ‘ilm il-ghaybi ‘indaka an taj’ala al-Qur’aan al-‘azeem rabee’a qalbi wa noora sadri wa jalaa’a huzni wa dhahaaba hammi wa ghammi (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant. My forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or taught to any of Your creation, or revealed in Your Book, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Holy Qur’aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety and distress)’, but Allaah will relieve him.” This is one of the medicines prescribed in sharee’ah. Similarly, one may say, “Laa ilaaha illa anta, subhaanaka, inni kuntu min al-zaalimeen (none has the right to be worshipped but You (O Allaah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers)” [cf. al-Anbiyaa’ 21:87] If you want to know more, please refer to the writings of the scholars on the topic of adhkaar (dhikr, remembering Allaah), such as al-Waabil al-Sayyib by Ibn al-Qayyim, al-Kalim al-Tayyib by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, al-Adhkaar by al-Nawawi, and Zaad al-Ma’aad, by Ibn al-Qayyim. But when faith grows weak, the soul’s acceptance of remedies prescribed in sharee’ah also grows weak. People nowadays have begun to rely on physical medicines more than on the spiritual remedies prescribed in Islam. But when faith is strong, the spiritual remedies prescribed in Islam have a more complete effect; their effect may be faster than that of physical medicines. We are all aware of the story of the man whom the Messenger SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent on a campaign. He camped near some Arabs, but those people near whom he camped did not show him any hospitality. Allaah willed that their chief should be stung by a snake, and they said to one another, “Go to those people who are camped (near us), maybe you will find a raaqi (one who recites ruqyah, i.e., incantations or prayers for healing) with them.” The Sahaabah said to them, “We will not recite ruqyah for your chief until you give us such and such number of sheep.” They said, “We agree.” Then one of the Sahaabah went and recited over the one who had been stung; he recited Soorat al-Faatihah only, then that person who had been stung got up as if he was released from a chain. This recitation of al-Faatihah had such an effect in this man because it came from a heart that was filled with faith. When they came back, the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “How did you know that it is a ruqyah?” But in our own times there is this weakness of religious commitment and faith, and people have started to rely on outward physical matters, and this is causing them further suffering. On the other hand there are those who cheat people and deceive them, claiming to be pious reciters of Qur’aan, but they consume people’s wealth unlawfully. People are of two extremes, one which thinks that recitation of Qur’aan has no effect at all, and the other extreme composed of cheaters who deceive people by reciting devious recitations, and some are moderate. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen, Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/465, 466 But as there is no contradiction between using permissible physical medicines as prescribed by doctors and using spiritual medicines such as ruqyah and seeking refuge with Allaah and other du’aa’s that are proven in sound reports, the two may be combined, as the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. It was proven that he used both kinds of treatment, and he said, “Strive to pursue that which will benefit you and seek refuge with Allaah, and do not feel helpless.” And he said: “Seek treatment, O slaves of Allaah, but do not seek treatment with things which are haraam.”\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.1 - It is permissible to give charity – other than the obligatory charity (zakaah etc.) – to poor non-Muslims, especially if they are relatives, on condition that they do not belong to people who are in a state of war against us and have not committed acts of aggression that would preclude our treating them kindly. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allaah loves those who deal with equity. It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allaah forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the Zaalimoon (wrongdoers those who disobey Allaah” [al-Mumtahinah 60:8-9] Asmaa’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “My mother came to me when she was still a mushrikah – at the time when there was a peace treaty between Quraysh and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) – accompanied by her father. I consulted the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), saying, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, my mother has come to me and she is asking for help. Should I uphold the ties of kinship with her?’ He said, ‘Yes, uphold the ties of kinship with her.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 2946). It was narrated that a Jewish woman came begging to ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) and she gave her something. The Jewish woman said to ‘Aa’ishah, “May Allaah protect you from the punishment of the grave.” ‘Aa’ishah did not like that, and when she saw the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sheasked him about it and he said “No.” ‘Aa’ishah said: “Then later on, the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘It has been revealed to me that you will be tried in your graves.’” (Musnad Ahmad, no. 24815). These two ahaadeeth indicate that it is permissible to give charity to the kuffaar. But it is not permissible to give zakaah funds to the poor among the kuffaar, because zakaah can only be given to Muslims to spend on the poor and needy among them as mentioned in the aayah of zakaah. Imaam al-Shaafa'i said: “There is nothing wrong with giving charity to a mushrik as a naafilah (supererogatory) action, but he has no right to charity from the obligatory (zakaah). Allaah praised people who, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… they give food, inspite of their love for it (or for the love of Him), to the Miskeen (the poor), the orphan, and the captive’ [al-Insaan 76:8].” (Kitaab al-Umm, part 2). Giving charity to poor Muslims is preferable and more befitting, because spending on them helps them to obey Allaah, and it helps them in both their worldly and spiritual affairs.This helps to strengthen the bonds among Muslims, especially nowadays when the poor among the Muslims far outnumber the rich. And Allaah is the One Whose help we seek. 2 – If the person who is asking for the money is Muslim and is definitely in need,then give him what you can in charity. The same applies even if he is not Muslim. But it is better for Muslims who are in need to refrain from begging in the streets. If they have no other choice, they should go to Islamic charity organizations which exist to channel charitable donations to the poor and needy. By the same token, those who want to give charity can also contact reliable charitable organizations so that their charity will reach those who deserve it. 3 – If the person who is asking for money –regardless of whether he is a Muslim or a kaafir – is asking for it in order to commit sin and buy something that is haraam, or he is going to use the money to help him to do something haraam, then it is not permissible to give that charity to him, because by doing so, one is helping him to commit that haraam action. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Help you one another in Al‑Birr and At‑Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression” [al-Maa’idah 5:2] And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh that Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying: Souls are like conscripted soldiers; those whom they recognize, they get along with, and those whom they do not recognize, they will not get along with. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Ahaadeeth al-Anbiyaa, Baab al-Arwaah junood mujannadah). Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on the hadeeth: Concerning the phrase Souls are like conscripted soldiers al-Khattaabi said: This may refer to their similarity as regards good or evil, righteousness or corruption. Good people are inclined towards other good people, and evil people are similarly inclined towards other evil people. Souls feel affinity with others according to the nature in which they were created, good or evil. If souls natures are similar, they will get along, otherwise they will not be on good terms with one another. It could be that what is being referred to is the beginning of creation in the realm of the unseen when, it is reported, souls were created before bodies, and used to meet one another and express their pessimism about the future. When souls have entered bodies (come to the physical realm) they may recognize one another from the past, and may be on friendly terms or otherwise based on that past experience. Someone else said: What it means is that when souls are created, they are made in two parts, and when the bodies in which the souls reside meet in this world, they either get along together or do not, based on the way in which these souls are created in this world. I say that this is not contradicted by the fact that some people who do not like one another at first may get along well later on, because the hadeeth is probably speaking about the moment of first meeting, which has to do with the original creation and nothing else. If they dislike one another at first but later come to like one another, it is because of something new, a new quality that makes them love one another after the initial dislike, such as a kaafir becoming a Muslim or a sinner being reformed. The phrase conscripted soldiers refers to different types or classifications, or groups brought together. Ibn al-Jawzi said: What we learn from this hadeeth is that when a person finds that he feels dislike towards someone who is known to be virtuous or righteous, he should try to find out the reason for that so that he can make the effort to rid himself of something undesirable. The opposite (if a person finds himself liking someone who is known to be evil) also applies. Al-Qurtubi said: Although they are all souls, they differ in different ways, so a person will feel an affinity with souls of one kind, and will get along with them because of the special quality that they have in common. So we notice that people of all types will get along with those with whom they share an affinity, and will keep away from those who are of other types. [Birds of a feather flock together Translator]. We may also note that within any given group or type, people may get along with some and dislike others, and this is in accordance with issues or qualities that form the basis of love or hate. We have narrated a mawsool report in Sunan Abi Yalaa, at the beginning of which is the story narrated from Amrah bint Abd al-Rahmaan, who said: There was a woman in Makkah who liked to joke, and she came and stayed with a woman in Madeenah who was like her. When Aaishah heard about this, she said, My beloved spoke the truth. I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saying and mentioned a similar hadeeth. The hadeeth was also narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, 4773. Al-Nawawi said: With regard to the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Souls are like conscripted soldiers; those whom they recognize, they get along with, and those whom they do not recognize, they will not get along with, the scholars said that the meaning is groups gathered together, or different types. As for them getting along, this happens because of something in common between them that Allaah has created. It was said that they are similar attributes that Allaah has created in them, or that they were created in a group and then dispersed in their bodies, so people who have similar characteristics will like one another, and those who do not have similar characteristics will not like one another. Al-Khattaabi and others said: this getting along with one another has to do with what Allaah decreed from the outset about the ultimate destiny of souls, whether they will be among the blessed [in Paradise] or the doomed [in Hell]. Souls are of two opposing kinds, and when they meet in this physical world, they will either love or hate one another depending on the way they were created. Good souls will be inclined towards other good souls, and evil souls will be inclined towards other evil souls. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al’-Uthaymeen Some companies give away promotional gifts to other companies with whom they have connections, and some of these promotional gifts may be of high value, such as watches, and some may be of lesser value, such as ordinary pens, diaries, calendars or t-shirts with the company logo. What is the ruling on such things? Let us suppose, for example, that a company is trying to market a specific product, such as lumber etc., so they go to other construction companies who buy lumber and give their employees items promoting the lumber company, so that this company will gain a reputation and be known to the employees of the construction company. These gifts may vary in value. Is it permissible for the employees of the construction company to accept these gifts? He answered, may Allaah preserve him: “I am afraid that this may involve toying with the market or that it may lead to treachery on the part of those who take these gifts. I think that it is not allowed.” Question: Could we say that if these gifts that the company gives out as advertising are given to the general public, such as calendars, for example, then they may take them, but if they are given exclusively to these employees or they are of high values, they should not take them? The Shaykh said: “This is our fatwa, but there is still the fear that this is done in order to toy with the market, for example, if there is a company working with you and they give you a gift like those they give to the general public, then this is OK, because it does not affect anyone. But if the gift is given in an attempt to win customers and make it harder for competitors, then this gift should not be accepted. And Allaah knows best.”\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.If the accident is major and serious, then it is OK to stop one’s prayer; if it is a minor incident that can be dealt with after completing the prayer, then it is not permissible. The scholars said: it is obligatory to stop one's prayer in order to save a negligent person from a fatal accident. For example, if you are praying and you see a snake approaching a man who is sitting down and has not noticed it. If it is heading for him, you have to stop your prayer and tell him so that he will not be bitten, possibly fatally. Or if you see a blind man walking in front of you whilst you are praying, and he is heading towards a well, and you are afraid that he may fall into it, then you have to stop your prayer and save him from that fatal accident, even if this means stopping your prayer. The same applies in cases of fire, etc. But if the siren goes off for a minor matter which can be dealt with after completing the prayer and it will not be too late if you complete the prayer first, then it is not permissible to stop your prayer before you have completed it, because this accident can be dealt with after completing the prayer, without anyone coming to further harm.

      "Praise be to Allah.Just as Islam has commanded the Muslim to take care of his physical wellbeing, so too it forbids him to do any kind of harm to his body. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There should be no harming or reciprocating harm.” (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, Kitaab al-Ahkaam, 2332; Ahmad, 2719; Maalik, 1234). The scholars have discussed the matter of doing dangerous sports. The author of al-Durr al-Mukhtaar said: “According to the Hanafi fiqh, ‘… all kinds of dangerous sports are permitted to the one who is skilled and is most likely to be safe from harm, such as archery/shooting, or hunting snakes. Watching these sports is permitted in such cases.’” (See al-Durr al-Mukhtaar, 6/404) The first condition: Complete skill and proficiency in these kinds of sports. That cannot be achieved without a lot of repeated practice and training, until that level of proficiency is achieved. If this training results in neglecting obligatory duties or ignoring Sunnah or recommended actions, then the view that it is haraam is applicable in this case. But if no such neglect results from this practice and training, then the view that it is permitted is applicable, and it is also permitted to watch. The second condition: That it is most likely that the person will be safe. If there is the slightest possibility that he will not be safe, or there is doubt that he will be safe, then the sport is haraam, because it may lead to his death. We are forbidden to reach towards such things, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “…and do not throw yourselves into destruction…” [al-Baqarah 2:195] The third condition. The sport should not be done for money. It is haraam to take payment for such sports, because this is regarded as consuming people’s wealth unlawfully, as there is no benefit in it. See Bughiyat al-Mushtaaq fi Hukm al-Lahw wa’l-La’b wa’l-Sibaaq, p. 156-157. I say: these things should be limited to special occasions and celebrations, provided that they comply with the conditions mentioned above. The soundness of this opinion is based on the reports about the Ethiopians playing in the mosque, so these matters should be restricted to the days of Eid. By analogy they may also be done on other special occasions and celebrations. Similarly, such sports are regarded as permissible on the condition that there is no mixing of men and women, and that the ‘awrahs of the players are not visible, and that no games of magic are involved.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meanings): The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him [Yoosuf 12:40] And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: This is lawful and this is forbidden., so as to invent lies against Allaah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allaah will never prosper. [al-Nahl 16:116] Say [O Muhammad, to the polytheists]: Tell me, what provision Allaah has sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful. Say [O Muhammad]: Has Allaah permitted you (to do so) or do you invent a lie against Allaah? [Yoonus 10:59]It is only for Allaah to say what is halaal and what is haraam, because He is the Law-giver, and there is no law-giver besides Him. When we say that a given thing is haraam, or halaal, we refer to the evidence in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Whatever we find is prohibited therein, we take as haraam, and whatever we find is permitted, we take as halaal. We refer to the sayings of the Sahaabah (Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and the Taabieen (the generation after the Sahaabah) may Allaah be pleased with them and the commentaries of the Salaf (first generations of Islam) on the texts of the Quraan and Sunnah, and we refer to the sayings and ijtihaad of the scholars. It is not permissible for us to allow or prohibit however we wish. When new issues come up, if we do not find a text in the Quraan or Sunnah, or in the sayings of the scholars of the salaf or the scholars of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah who came before us, then we have to refer to trustworthy scholars and people of understanding, as Allaah commands us (interpretation of the meaning): so ask of those who know the Scripture [al-Nahl 16:43]. These are the scholars, who can do ijtihaad, examine the matter and make analogies (qiyaas) with the existing texts of Islam, taking into consideration the principles of necessity, and taking note of what is harmful to the interests of shareeah and what is beneficial, relying on the basic general principles of shareeah, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning), he allows them as lawful al-tayyibaat [(i.e., all good and lawful things as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.] [al-Araaf 7:157] and the hadeeth, There should be no harming nor reciprocating harm (reported by Ibn Maajah, 2331), and avoiding following whims and desires. Every evil thing that is proven to be harmful is haraam, and every good and beneficial thing is halaal.

      "Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to delay ghusl until the time of Fajr but it is mustahabb (recommended) for them to do wudoo’ before they sleep. This was the view of the majority of scholars, and al-Nawawi reported that there was scholarly consensus on this point. (al-Kaafi, 1/173; al-Muhadhdhab, 1/33; al-Mughni, 1/229) Their evidence is the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) whose authenticity is agreed upon, in which she narrated that when the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to sleep whilst he was in a state of impurity (junub), he would wash his private parts and do wudoo’ as for prayer. (Narrated by al-Jamaa’ah). They also use as evidence the report narrated by Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said that ‘Umar said, “O Messenger of Allaah, may anyone of us sleep when he is in a state of impurity?” He said, “yes, if he does wudoo’.” (Agreed upon). The wisdom behind doing wudoo’ is that it reduces the impurity and is better for the body. The Zaahiriyyah and Ibn Habeeb among the Maalikis thought that it was obligatory for the person who is in a state of impurity to do wudoo’, on the basis of the hadeeth of ‘Umar referred to above.

      "Praise be to Allah.The command to give the meat of the sacrifice in charity is reported in a number of ahaadeeth, as was the permission to eat some and preserve some. Al-Bukhaari and Muslim reported that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: “Some poor families among the people of the desert came to al-Madeenah on the occasion of ‘Eid al-Adhaa at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘Keep with you meat sufficient for three days, and whatever is left, give in charity.’ After that, they said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah, the people made water-skins with [the hides of] their sacrificial animals, and they rendered the fat from them. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘What about it?’ They said, ‘You forbade us to eat the meat of our sacrificial animals after three days.’ He said, ‘I forbade you to do that because of the people who came, but now eat some and preserve some and give some in charity.’” (Reported by Muslim, 3643). Al-Nawawi said, commenting on this hadeeth: “ The phrase ‘I forbade you to do that because of the people who came’ refers to the poor Bedouin who came to Madeenah, and this was so that they could be helped. ‘Rendered’ means that they melted down the fat from the animals (to be stored and used). The phrase ‘I forbade you to do that because of the people who came, but now eat some and preserve some and give some in charity’ is a clear statement that this prohibition of keeping more than three days’ worth of meat no longer applies; it is also a commandment to eat some and to give some in charity. With regard to the portion to be given in charity, if it is a voluntary sacrifice, then giving some of it in charity is obligatory, according to the view regarded by our companions as correct. It is preferable [mustahabb] for most of it to be given in charity. They said: at the very least, a third should be eaten, a third should be given as gifts and a third should be given in charity. There is another opinion that suggests half may be eaten and half given in charity. This difference of opinion has to do with the amount that is mustahabb. With regard to the other parts of the animal, it is OK to give them in charity . As for eating from it, it is mustahabb but is not waajib (obligatory)… The majority of scholars interpreted this command (i.e., the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): ‘… eat thereof…’ [al-Hajj 22:28 and 36]) as implying encouragement or permission, especially since it came after it had been prohibited.” Maalik said: “There is no limit to what may be eaten or given in charity or used to feed the poor or the rich, whether one wants to give it uncooked or cooked.” (al-Kaafi, 1/424). The Shaafa’is said that it is mustahabb to give most of it in charity, and said: “At least one third of it may be eaten, and one third given in charity, and one third given away as gifts.” They said that one half may be eaten, but it is more correct to give some of it away in charity.” (Nayl al-Awtaar, 5/145; al-Siraaj al-Wahhaaj, 563). Ahmad said: “We go along with the hadeeth of ‘Abd-Allaah (ibn ‘Abbaas – may Allaah be pleased with them both): ‘He should eat one third himself, feed one third to whomever he wants, and give one third in charity.” (Reported by Abu Moosa al-Isfahaani in al-Wazaa’if; he said it is a hasan hadeeth. This is also the opinion of Ibn Mas’ood and Ibn ‘Umar. No conflicting opinion is known among the Sahaabah. Al-Mughni, 8/632). The reason why there is a difference of opinion as to how much of the sacrifice may be given in charity is that there are conflicting reports, and some reports were narrated without specifying a particular amount, such as the report of Buraydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘I had forbidden you to eat from the sacrificial meat for more than three days so that those who could afford it could give to those who are poor, but now you can eat as you wish, feed others from it, and preserve some.’” (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1430; he said it is a saheeh hasan hadeeth). The scholars among the Companions of the Prophet and others followed this. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Contents Related Interest-based loans Going for Hajj or paying off the debt? Praise be to Allah.Interest-based loans If this loan is based on riba (usury, interest) , then it is haram and is one of the major sins and one of the seven sins that doom a person to Hell. All of the nations regarded it as forbidden, even the Greeks who were idol-worshippers. One of them, whose name was Solon said: Money is like a sterile hen; a drachma cannot give birth to a drachma. In the Christian belief it says that one who consumes usury should not be shrouded if he dies, and even the Jews forbade usury. Islam has forbidden it in a manner that leaves no room for doubt concerning its prohibition. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba. So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops consuming Riba, shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns (to Riba), such are the dwellers of the Fire — they will abide therein.” [al-Baqarah 2:275] “O you who believe! Fear Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from Riba (from now onward) if you are (really) believers.” [al-Baqarah 2:278] Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the price of blood, the price of a dog and the earnings of a prostitute, and he cursed the woman who does tattoos and those who have them done, the one who consumes riba (usury) and the one who pays it, and he cursed the one who makes images. (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2123) ‘Abd-Allah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba and the one who pays it. (Narrated by Muslim, 1597) Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Avoid the seven sins that doom a person to Hell.” They said, “O Messenger of Allah, what are they?” He said: “Associating others in worship with Allah (shirk); witchcraft; killing a soul whom Allah has forbidden killing, unless that is done lawfully; consuming riba (usury, interest); consuming the property of orphans; running away from the battlefield; slandering innocent, chaste, believing women.” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 2615; Muslim, 89) Samurah ibn Jundub (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Last night I saw (in a dream) that two men came to me and took me out to a sacred land. They set out with me until we came to a river of blood in which a man was standing, and on the bank of the river there was a man with stones in front of him, facing the man who was in the river. Every time the man wanted to get out, the man (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth and he went back to where he had been. I said: ‘What is this?’ They said, ‘The one whom you saw in the river is the one who consumed riba.’” (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 1979) So you have to repent to Allah from this action. But if the loan was a good kind of loan that did not involve riba, there is nothing wrong with it. Going for Hajj or paying off the debt? With regard to Hajj, the person who cannot spend on himself because he is of limited means is not obliged to go for Hajj, but which of the two is more important, going for Hajj or paying off the debt? The most correct view is that paying off the debt is more important, because the debtor is not obliged to do Hajj, since one of the conditions of Hajj is that one should be able to do it. If there is a conflict between your doing Hajj and your paying off your debt , then give priority to paying off the debt . But if there is no conflict, such as there being plenty of time for you to pay off your debt, or if the person to whom you owe money is patient and can wait, then the correct view is that there is nothing wrong with your doing Hajj or ‘Umrah. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: “It is permissible for a person who is in debt and facing financial hardship, either because he is unable to earn money or because the creditor is absent and he cannot pay him, to go for Hajj if someone else takes him for Hajj, provided that this does not affect his ability to pay the debt.” (Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 26/16) All of that is subject to the condition that you are completely able to perform Hajj and that you pay off debts to anyone who asks you to pay him back when the debt becomes due, and that you are able to pay for the journey and its provisions, and whatever you need to take care of your affairs whilst you are travelling, without neglecting your family or those on whom you are obliged to spend. So you should leave with them enough to cover their needs. If you do not do that then you are sinning and neglecting those whom Allah has commanded you to take care of. Khaythamah said: “We were sitting with ‘Abd-Allah ibn ‘Amr when Qaharman came to him. He said, ‘Have you given the slaves their food?’ He said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Go and give it to them. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient sin for a man if he withholds the food of his slave.”’ (Sahih Muslim, 996) Ibn ‘Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “It is sufficient sin for a man if he neglects those whom he is responsible for.” (Narrated by Abu Dawud, 1692) And Allah knows best.\n",

But if one man gives the khutbah and another leads the prayer for a valid reason, this is permissible. This is what Ahmad stated…because if it is permissible for someone else to take over leading the prayer for a valid reason, then this applies even more so in the case of the khutbah with the prayer. If there is no reason, then Ahmad (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: ‘I do not like it if there is no excuse.’ The reason why it is not liked may be because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do both of them, and he said, ‘Pray as you have seen me praying’ (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Ahmad), and because the khutbah takes the place of two rak’ahs. The reason why it is permissible may be because the khutbah is separate from the prayer, as if it is two prayers.” (al-Mughni, part 2, Kitaab al-Jumu’ah: Fasl: yatawallaa al-salaah man yatawallaa al-khutbah. See also: al-Badaa’i’, 1/262, al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 1/499). The fact that the one who leads the prayer knows more Qur’aan than the khateeb is not a reason for going against the Sunnah of the khateeb also being the imaam for the prayers. The khateeb should lead the people in prayer and recite whatever he can of Qur’aan, even if there are people behind him who know more than he does. And Allaah knows best.\n",

That happens by worshipping the shayaateen (devils), by offering sacrifices to them and making vows to them, and other kinds of worship, and offering sacrifices to them and seeking to draw close to them with things that they love, until they serve a person and do what he wants.

      "Contents Related Is gambling haram? Why is gambling haram? What are the negative consequences of gambling? Praise be to Allah.Is gambling haram? Gambling is haram because Allah has forbidden it, and He rules as He wills. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), gambling, al-Ansab [sacrifices for idols, etc.] and al-Azlam [arrows for seeking luck or decision] are an abomination of Shaytan’s handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants (alcoholic drink) and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from al-salah (the prayer). So, will you not then abstain?” [al-Maidah 5:90-91] Why is gambling haram? With regard to the wisdom behind the prohibition of gambling , any wise person will see that there are many reasons for it, including the following: Gambling makes a person rely on accidents, luck and wishful thinking for his earnings, instead of hard work, the sweat of his brow and paying respect to the ways prescribed by Allah. Gambling destroys families and causes the loss of wealth through haram means. It makes rich families poor and humiliates proud souls. Gambling results in enmity and hatred among the players, because they are consuming one another’s wealth unlawfully and getting wealth unlawfully. Gambling turns people away from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer, and pushes the players to have the worst of attitudes and habits. Gambling is a sinful hobby that wastes time and effort, and makes people get used to laziness and idleness. It stops the ummah from working and producing. Gambling pushes people to commit crimes because the one who is penniless wants to get hold of money in any way he can, even if he has to steal it or take it by force, or through accepting bribes and cheating. Gambling causes stress, illness and nervous breakdowns. It breeds hatred and in most cases leads to crime, suicide, insanity and chronic illness. Gambling pushes the gambler to bad behaviour such as drinking alcohol and taking drugs. The atmosphere in which gambling takes place is dimly lit and filled with cigarette smoke; people talk in hushed voices and whispers, and sneak in and out as if they are up to no good. They come in hesitantly, filled with suspicion, and gather around the green table, breathing uneasily and with their hearts pounding. They are supposed to be friends playing a game, but in reality they are enemies, each of them lying in wait for the other and trying to make gains at the expense of the other and his children. The owner of the place tries to numb the feelings of all participants by offering dreamy music, fallen women, all kinds of drinks and cigarettes. The green table is surrounded with cheating and deception. The waiters and girls may tell one player about another player’s cards, helping one player to beat another by means of nods and whispers. Sometimes they achieve a kind of balance to make sure the game carries on and people stay for longer. No doubt everyone loses in the end, they lose the money they spend on drinks and cigarettes, the money they give to the waiters, the money they spend on drinks for the girls, and all kinds of other losses. Even the one who wins all or most of the games loses all or most of his winnings, and the loser loses everything. And at the end of the night, they all sneak away, showing the signs of depression and humiliation, and the loser warns the winner to look out the next day. (Ahmad Shalabi, al-Hayat al-Ijtima’iyyah fi’l-Tafkir al-Islami, p. 241) What are the negative consequences of gambling? How many families have become poor because of gambling ? How many mouths have gone hungry, how many bodies have become naked or been clothed in nothing but rags? How many marriages have failed, how many jobs have been lost, because of a person who stole money to support his gambling habit? How many men have sold their religion and honour at the gambling table? Gambling destroys everything, even when the aim is money. It includes wine, smoking, bad company, darkness, confusion, cheating, hatred, watching for opportunities to take advantage of others, deception and all other kinds of evil.

With regard to this particular matter, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-‘Uthaymin replied as follows: “Yes, if he fasts six days of Shawwal , he does not have to fast al-Ayyam al-Beed during that month too, whether he fasted the six days at the same time as al-Ayyam al-Beed (the 13 th, 14th and 15th of the hijri month) or before them or after them, because it is true that he has fasted three days of the month. ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: ‘The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast three days of every month, and he did not bother whether he fasted them at the beginning of the month or in the middle or at the end.” This case is similar to that of Tahiyyat al-Masjid (prayer to “greet the mosque” upon entering), which does not have to be done if one prays a regular prayer upon entering the mosque.

      "Praise be to Allah.A woman who is being forced to commit zinaa [unlawful sexual activity] is obliged to defend herself and should not give in even if she kills the one who wants to do that to her. This self-defence is waajib (obligatory), and she is not at fault if she kills the one who wants to force her into zinaa. Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Hibbaan reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever is killed defending his property is a shaheed (martyr), whoever is killed defending himself is a shaheed, whoever is killed defending his religion is a shaheed, and whoever is killed defending his family is a shaheed. In the commentary on this hadeeth it says: whoever is killed defending his family is a shaheed refers to the one who defends the honour of his wife and female relatives. If a man is obliged to defend his wife and fight off the one who wants to rape her even if this leads to his own death then this obligation applies even more to the woman herself, who must defend herself and not give in to the aggressor who wants to violate her honour, even if she is killed, because if she is killed she will also be a shaheedah, just as her husband will be a shaheed if he was killed defending her honour. Shahaadah (martyrdom, the status of shaheed) is a high status which is only achieved by the one who dies in the way of obedience to Allaah and that which He loves, which indicates that Allaah loves this kind of defence, a mans fighting to defend his wifes honour and a womans fighting to defend herself. But if she is unable to defend herself, and the evil aggressor overpowers her and rapes her by force, then she should not be subjected to any punishment (hadd or tazeer); rather, the punishment should be carried out on the evil aggressor. It says in al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah al-Hanbali: Concerning a woman who was pursued by a man, and she killed him to protect herself, Ahmad said: If she knew that he wanted [to rape] her, and she killed him to protect herself, then she is not at fault. Ahmad mentioned the hadeeth which al-Zuhri reported from al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, from Ubayd ibn Umayr, in which it said that a man had visitors from [the tribe of] Hudhayl, and he wanted [to rape] a woman, so she threw a rock at him and killed him. Umar said, By Allaah, there is no diyah for him ever i.e., she did not have to pay the blood money for him. If it is permissible to defend one's money, which one can give away, then a woman defending and protecting herself and her honour which cannot be given away, is clearly more permissible than a man defending his money. If this is clear, then she is obliged to defend herself if she can, because letting someone overpower her [rape her] is haraam, and by not defending herself, she lets him overpower her. [al-Mughni, 8/331] And Allaah knows best. Al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Marah, 5/42-43. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Turuq al-Hukmiyyah, 18: (Section) A woman who had committed zinaa was brought to Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him), and he asked her about it and she admitted it, so he commanded that she should be stoned. Ali said: Maybe she had a reason. So he said to her, What made you do that? She said, I had a partner who shared livestock with me; his camels had water and milk, and mine had none. I got thirsty, so I asked him to give me something to drink, but he refused unless I let him have his way with me. I refused three times, but I was so thirsty that I thought I was going to die, so I gave him what he wanted, and he gave me something to drink. Ali said: Allaahu akbar! But if one is forced by necessity without wilful disobedience nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. [al-Baqarah 2:173 interpretation of the meaning]. In Sunan al-Bayhaqi it says: From Abu Abd al-Rahmaan al-Sulami, who said: A woman was brought to Umar who had been extremely thirsty, and had passed by a shepherd and asked him to give her something to drink; he had refused to give her something to drink unless she let him have his way with her. [Umar] consulted with the people as to whether he should have her stoned. Ali said, She was forced to do it. I think you should let her go. So he did so. I say: this is what should be done. If a woman is in desperate need of food and drink from a man, which he will not give her unless she lets him have his way with her, and she is scared that she will die without them, so she lets him have his way with her, then she is not to be punished. If it were asked, is it permissible for her in this situation to let him have his way with her, or does she have to suffer [her hunger and thirst] with patience, even if she dies? The answer is that her case is like that of a woman who is forced to commit zinaa, to whom it is said, Either you let me have my way with you, or I will kill you. The woman who is forced to do this should not be punished; she can save herself from being killed in this manner, but if she bears it (i.e., being killed) with sabr (patience), this is better for her.

The fact that there was no partition at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was either because there was no need for it or because there was a reason why they could not have a partition. With regard to the former, the Sahaabah, may Allaah be pleased with them, had such strong faith in Allaah that they would not look at women; with regard to the latter, the financial situation of the Sahaabah, as we know, especially before the conquests, was one of hardship, and they could not afford to put a partition between themselves and the women. Having understood this, we should next look at which is further removed from fitnah, having a partition or not having it? Everyone will agree that having the partition is less likely to cause fitnah. If that is the case, then whatever is less likely to cause fitnah is what should be done. If you say, “If we insist on keeping it, those who want to remove it will stay away from the mosque,” our response is that if they stay away, they are doing wrong. They have no excuse for failing to pray in jamaa’ah because of this partition being there. Having the partition there is not a sin such that they could say, “We are not coming to be witnesses to sin.” If they stay away, they are committing sin by failing to attend prayers in congregation.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who replied: “I think that this is an innovated bid’ah. No preacher can claim that he loves to preach to people more than the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did. It is not reported anywhere that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to stand up to address the people with a khutbah in the graveyard. All that is mentioned is that one day he came to a grave when the burial had not yet been completed. He sat down, and his companions sat down with him, and he started talking to them about what happens when a person is on his deathbed and after he dies. This is the nearest thing that has been reported, and anyone who stands up to preach to the people after a burial is doing so on the basis of incorrect ijtihaad. Question: But the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did this once…? Answer: He did not preach as such. He just started talking to the people who were sitting with him. It was not intended as preaching and he did not stand up to deliver a khutbah. Question: So if a person sits by the grave and others sit with him, and he tells them the hadeeth of Abu Dawood (the hadeeth of al-Bara’), would this action be OK according to sharee’ah? Answer: It is not OK according to sharee’ah, because the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not sit with the intention of preaching. He just sat down to wait until the burial was over. There is a difference between what happens by coincidence and what is done deliberately, and he never did this on any other occasion. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered: “No, because when she gave birth, the relationship between her and her husband came to an end. It is not permissible for her to wash him because now she is no longer his wife, and thus if she were to enter into a (new) marriage contact at this time, it would be valid.” When a woman’s husband dies, she should observe the ‘iddah (waiting period or mourning period) of four months and ten days. If she is pregnant, her ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth. Once her ‘iddah is over or she has given birth, there is no longer any connection between them. It is permissible for a wife to wash her husband’s body, and vice versa, if this is still within the ‘iddah period, because the connection between husband and wife does not end merely because of death. The evidence for this from the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came back from (the cemetery of) al-Baqee’ and found me suffering a headache, saying ‘Oh, my head!’ He said, ‘No, O ‘Aa’ishah, it is I who should be saying, “Oh, my head!”’ Then he said, ‘What’s the matter? If you die before me, I will take care of you: I will wash your body, wrap you in your shroud, pray for you and bury you.’” (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 1454; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, page 50). It was reported that ‘Aa’ishah said, concerning the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “If I could go back and do things all over again, no one would wash him but his wives.” (Reported by Abu Dawood, 3733. Al-Albaani classed its isnaad as saheeh in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, p. 49). And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible for a Muslim to swear by anything except Allaah, may He be exalted, alone, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever swears an oath, let him swear by Allaah, or else keep silent.” It is not essential for a person swearing an oath to put his hand on the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’an) for the oath to be valid, but some people do this to make the oath more binding, so that the person swearing the oath will be afraid to tell lies. It is not permissible for the Muslim to put his hand on the Tawraat or Injeel when swearing an oath, because the copies in circulation are distorted, and are not the original Books that were revealed to Moosa and ‘Eesaa (peace be upon them); and because the Message with which Allaah sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) abrogates the messages that came before. If the system in a country that is not ruled by Islamic law requires the person swearing an oath to put his hand on the Tawraat or Injeel, or both, then the Muslim should ask the court to let him swear by Allaah, may He be exalted. There is nothing wrong with him putting his hand on the Holy Qur’aan, which is the Word of Allaah and is therefore one of His attributes. If they do not allow him this request, and he is forced to swear by the Tawraat or Injeel, then this is considered to be compulsion, and there is no sin on him if he puts his hand on one or both of them, so long as he does not intend to show respect to them by doing so.

      "Praise be to Allah.Wailing is forbidden for both men and women according to the well-known imaams. It was reported in al-Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If the woman who wails does not repent before she dies, on the Day of Resurrection she will be wearing a garment of scabs and pants made of melted tar.” In al-Sunan it is reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the woman who wails and the one who listens to her. In al-Saheeh it is reported that he said: “He is not one of us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and says things like the people of Jaahiliyyah say.” For women to uncover their faces where strangers (i.e., men to whom they are not related) can see them is not permitted. The man who is in charge must enjoin what is good and forbid this evil and others. Whoever does not refrain from doing this should be punished in such a way as to make them stop, especially women who wail at gravesides, because this is a sin that is hated by Allaah and His Messenger, as it involves panic, lamenting and wailing. It hurts the dead and causes fitnah (trial, temptation) to the living, and consumes people’s wealth unlawfully. It makes people forget about the patience and hope for reward enjoined upon them by Allaah, and it may lead to evil deeds. The Muslims should put a stop to such practices. And Allaah knows best.

      "Praise be to Allah.We do not wish to respond to slander in kind, but we will answer you, you disbeliever, with quotes from the Word of God (the Qur’aan), if you even believe in the existence of God. O disbeliever, we debate with you in the words addressed by Allaah (the Arabic name of the One True God) to the People of the Book (Jews and Christians) and the disbelievers. He says (interpretation of the meaning): “O People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allaah aught but the truth. The Messiah ‘Eesa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary) was (no more than) a Messenger of Allaah and His Word (‘Be!’ – and he was), which He bestowed on Maryam, and a spirit created by Him; so believe in Allaah and His Messengers. Say not: ‘Three (trinity)!’ Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allaah is (the only) One (God). Glory be to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allaah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of Affairs.” [al-Nisa’ 4:171] “Say: O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do you criticize us for no other reason than that we believe in Allaah, and in (the revelation) which has been sent down before (us), and that most of you are faasiqoon (rebellious and disobedient [to Allaah])?” [al-Maa’idah 5:59] “How can you disbelieve in Allaah? Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life. Then He will give you death, then again will bring you to life (on the Day of Resurrection) and then unto Him you will return.” [al-Baqarah 2:28] “… whosoever disbelieves in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away… Verily, those who disbelieve in Allaah and His messengers and wish to make a distinction between Allaah and His Messengers (by believing in Allaah and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, ‘We believe in some but not in others,’ and wish to adopt a way in between, They are in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment.” [al-Nisa’ 4:136, 150-151] O disbeliever, do you think that you can do any harm to Allaah by your disbelief? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… But if you disbelieve, then unto Allaah belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and Allaah is Ever Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all praise.” [al-Nisa’ 4:131] You will only increase in hatefulness and loss in the sight of Allaah, you disbeliever, for you are one of the worst of living creatures, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily, the worst of moving (living) creatures before Allaah are those who disbelieve, - so they shall not believe.” [al-Anfaal 8:55] O disbeliever, are you not going to die? Or do you doubt that as well? Do you know what your position will be when you die, if you die in a state of disbelief? Listen: “And if you could see when the angels take away the souls of those who disbelief (at death), they smite their faces and their backs, (saying): ‘Taste the punishment of the blazing Fire.’” [al-Anfaal 8:50] O disbeliever, woe to you from what will happen to you on the Day of Resurrection! Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… so woe to the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day (i.e., the Day of Resurrection, when they will be thrown in the blazing Fire).” [Maryam 19:37] We have an appointment with you after death, on the Day of Reckoning: “On that day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger [Muhammad SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] will wish that they were buried in the earth, but they will never be able to hide a single fact from Allaah.” [al-Nisa’ 4:42] O disbeliever, do you know what Allaah has prepared for you if you die in a state of disbelief? Read: “And whosoever does not believe in Allaah and His Messenger [Muhammad SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)], then verily, We have prepared for the disbelievers a blazing Fire.” [al-Fath 48:13] “Verily, those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers, it is they on whom is the Curse of Allaah and of the angels and mankind, combined.” [al-Baqarah 2:161] “Verily, those who disbelieved, and died while they were disbelievers, the (whole) earth full of gold will not be accepted from any one of them even if they offered it as a ransom. For them is a painful torment and they will have no helpers.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:91] “Surely, those who reject Faith, neither their properties, nor their offspring will avail them aught against Allaah. They are the dwellers of the Fire, therein they will abide.” [Aal ‘Imraan 3:116] Do you know what you will have to drink in Hell if you die as a disbeliever? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… But those who disbelieved will have a drink of boiling fluids and painful torment because they used to disbelieve.” [Yoonus 10:5] Do you know what you will have to wear on that Day? Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… Then as for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them, boiling water will be poured down over their heads.” [al-Hajj 22:19] Do you know what kind of punishment you will endure? “Surely! Those who disbelieved in Our Signs, We shall burn them in Fire. As often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for other skins that they may taste the punishment. Truly, Allaah is Ever Most Powerful, All-Wise.” [al-Nisa’ 4:56] “If only those who disbelieved knew (the time) when they will not be able to ward off the Fire from their faces, nor from their backs; and they will not be helped.” [al-Anbiya’ 21:39] O reviler, maybe on the Day of Judgement you will wish that you had been a Muslim in this world. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Perhaps (often) will those who disbelieve wish that they were Muslims.” [al-Hijr 15:2] O disbeliever, you are among those who have disbelieved and done wrong. Allaah says concerning you and your like (interpretation of the meaning): “Verily those who disbelieve and do wrong, Allaah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to any way” [al-Nisa’ 4:168] “Those who disbelieve and deny our signs are those who will be the dwellers of the Hell-fire.” [al-Maa’idah 5:10] There you will have no life, but neither will you be able to find any respite in death. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “But those who disbelieve, for them will be the Fire of Hell. Neither will it have a complete killing effect on them so that they die, nor shall its torment be lightened for them. Thus do We requite every disbeliever!” [Faatir 35:36] O disbeliever, have the glad tidings of a punishment from which you will not be able to ransom yourself: “Verily, those who disbelieve, if they had all that is in the earth, and as much again therewith to ransom themselves thereby from the torment on the Day of Resurrection, it would never be accepted of them, and theirs would be a painful torment.” [al-Maa’idah 5:36] O disbeliever, if you want to mock Islam and its followers, this is nothing new: “Beautified is the life of this world for those who disbelieve, and they mock at those who believe. But those who obey Allaah’s Orders and keep away from what He has forbidden, will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allaah gives (of His bounty on the Day of Resurrection) to whom He wills without limit.” [al-Baqarah 2:212] O disbeliever, if you think that the light of Islam will be extinguished, then you are living in a world of illusions. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “They (the disbelievers) want to extinguish Allaah’s Light with their mouths, but Allaah will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the disbelievers hate (it).” [al-Tawbah 9:32] O disbeliever, do you know that you are cursed if you do not submit to Allaah, so save yourself from this curse: “Verily, Allaah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a flaming Fire (Hell).” [al-Ahzaab 33:64] There is still time for you to repent from sin and transgression, so long as you are still alive. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease (from disbelief) their past will be forgiven. But if they return (thereto), then the examples of those (punished) before them have already preceded (as a warning).” [al-Anfaal 8:38] Whoever is guided, then it is for his own benefit, and whoever disbelieves, then Allaah has no need of His creation.

      "Related Praise be to Allah.Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked this question and he replied as follows: ‘Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. Nothing to that effect has been reported in any saheeh hadeeth from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or from his Companions. None of the imams of the Muslims encouraged or recommended such things, neither the four imams, nor any others. No reliable scholars have narrated anything like this, neither from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), nor from the Sahabah, nor from the Tabi'een; neither in any saheeh report or in a da’eef (weak) report; neither in the books of Saheeh, nor in al-Sunan, nor in the Musnads. No hadeeth of this nature was known during the best centuries, but some of the later narrators reported ahadeeth like the one which says “Whoever puts kohl in his eyes on the day of Ashura will not suffer from eye disease in that year, and whoever takes a bath (does ghusl) on the day of Ashura will not get sick in that year, etc.” They also narrated reports concerning the supposed virtues of praying on the day of Ashura, and other reports saying that on the day of Ashura Adam repented, the Ark settled on Mount Joodi, Yoosuf returned to Ya’qoob, Ibraheem was saved from the fire, the ram was provided for sacrifice instead of Ismaa’eel, and so on. They also reported a fabricated hadeeth that is falsely attributed to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), which says, “Whoever is generous to his family on the day of Ashura, Allah will be generous to him for the rest of the year.” (Then Ibn Taymiyah discussed the two misguided groups who were in Koofah, Iraq, both of whom took Ashura as a festival because of their bid’ah). The Rafidi group made an outward show of allegiance to the Ahl al-Bayt although inwardly they were either heretics and disbelievers or ignorant and bound by whims and desires. The Nasibi group hated ‘Ali and his companions, because of the troubles and killings that had occurred. It is reported in Saheeh Muslim that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “In (the tribe of) Thaqeef there will be a liar and an oppressor.” The liar was al-Mukhtar ibn Abi ‘Ubayd al-Thaqafi, who made an outward show of allegiance to and support of the Ahl al-Bayt, and killed ‘Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad, the governor of Iraq, who had equipped the party that killed al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both); then he (al-Mukhaar) made it clear that he was a liar, by claiming to be a prophet and that Jibreel (peace be upon him) brought revelation to him. People told Ibn ‘Umar and Ibn ‘Abbas about this, and said to one of them, “al-Mukhtar ibn Abi ‘Ubayd is claiming to receive revelation [annahu yanzilu ‘alayhi].” He said, “He is telling the truth, for Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘Shall I inform you (O people) upon whom the shayateen (devils) descend [tanazzalu]? They descend upon every lying, sinful person.’ [al-Shu’ara’ 26:221].” [Translator’s note: the words translated as “receive revelation” and “descend” both come from the same root in Arabic]. They said to the other: “Al-Mukhtar is claiming that he receives inspiration.” He said, “he is telling the truth. ‘… And certainly, the Shayateen (devils) do inspire their friends (from mankind) to dispute with you…’ [al-An’aam 6:121 – interpretation of the meaning].” As for the oppressor , this was al-Hajjaj ibn Yoosuf al-Thaqafi, who was opposed to ‘Ali and his companions. Al-Hajjaj was a Nasibi and al-Mukhtar was a Rafidi, and this Rafidi was a greater liar and more guilty of fabrication and heresy, because he claimed to be a prophet… There was much trouble and fighting between these two groups in Kufa. When al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them both) was killed on the day of Ashura, he was killed by the sinful, wrongdoing group. Allah honoured al-Husayn with martyrdom, as He honoured other members of his family, and raised his status, as He honoured Hamzah, Ja’far, his father ‘Ali and others. Al-Husayn and his brother al-Hasan are the leaders of the youth of Paradise. High status can only be attained through suffering, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him said, when he was asked which people suffer the most. He said, “The Prophets, then righteous people, then the next best and the next best. A man will suffer according to his level of faith. If his faith is solid, he will suffer more, but if his faith is shaky, he will suffer less. The believer will keep on suffering until he walks on the earth with no sin.” (reported by al-Tirmidhi and others). Al-Hasan and al-Husayn achieved what they achieved and reached the high status they reached by the help and decree of Allah. They did not suffer as much as their forefathers had, for they were born and raised during the glory days of Islam, and the Muslims respected and honoured them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) died when they were still young, and Allah blessed them by testing them in such a manner that they would be able to catch up with the rest of their family members, as those who were of a higher status than them were also tested. ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib was better than them, and he was killed as a shaheed (martyr). The killing of al-Husayn was one of the things that caused fitnah (tribulation) among the people, as was the killing of ‘Uthman, which was one of the greatest causes of fitnah, because of which the ummah is still split today. Thus the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “There are three things, whoever is saved from them is truly saved: my death, the killing of a patient khaleefah, and the Dajjal (‘antichrist’).” Then Shaykh al-Islam (may Allah have mercy on him) mentioned a little about the biography of al-Hasan and his just character, then he said: “Then he died, and Allah was pleased with him and honoured him. Some groups wrote to al-Husayn and promised to support and help him if he went ahead and declared himself khaleefah, but they were not sincere. When al-Husayn sent his cousin [son of his paternal uncle] to them, they broke their word and gave help to the one they had promised to defend him against, and fought with him against [al-Husayn’s cousin]. Those who were wise and who loved al-Husayn, such as Ibn 'Abbas and Ibn ‘Umar and others, advised him not to go to them, and not to accept any promises from them. They thought that his going to them served no useful interest and that the consequences would not be good. Things turned out just as they said, and this is how Allah decreed it would happen. When al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) went out and saw that things were not as he had expected, he asked them to let him go back, or to let him join the army that was defending the borders of Islam, or join his cousin Yazeed, but they would not let him do any of these things unless he gave himself up to them as a prisoner. So he fought with them, and they killed him and some of those who were with him, and he was wrongfully slain so he died as a shaheed whose martyrdom brought him honour from Allah, and so he was reunited with the good and pure members of his family. His murder brought shame on those who had wrongfully killed him, and caused much mischief among the people. An ignorant, wrongful group – who were either heretics and hypocrites, or misguided and misled – made a show of allegiance to him and the members of his household, so they took the day of ‘Ashura as a day of mourning and wailing, in which they openly displayed the rituals of jahiliyyah such as slapping their cheeks and rending their garments, grieving in the manner of the jahiliyyah. But what Allah has commanded us to do when disaster strikes – when the disaster is fresh – is to bear it with patience and fortitude, and to seek reward, and to remember that all things come from Allah and we must return to Him, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): “… but give glad tidings to al-sabiroon (the patient ones), who, when afflicted with calamity, say: ‘Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.’ They are those on whom are al-salawat (the blessings) (i.e., who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.” [al-Baqarah 2:155-157] . It is reported in al-Saheeh that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “he is not one of us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and prays with the prayer of Jahiliyyah.” And he said: “I have nothing to do with those who strike [their cheeks], shave [their heads] and rend [their garments].” And he said: “If the woman who wails does not repent before she dies, she will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection wearing trousers made of tar and a shirt of scabs.” In al-Musnad, it is reported from Faatimah bint al-Husayn, from her father al-Husayn, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no man who suffers a calamity, and when he remembers it, even if it is old, he says ‘Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return),’ but Allaah will give a reward equal to the reward He gave him on the day he suffered the calamity.” This is how Allaah honours the Believers. If the disaster suffered by al-Husayn, and other disasters, are mentioned after all this time, we should say “Innaa Lillaahi wa innaa ilayhi raaji’oon (Truly, to Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return),” as Allaah and His Messenger commanded, so as to be given the reward like that earned on the day of the disaster itself. If Allaah commanded us to be patient and steadfast and to seek reward at the time of the disaster, then how about after the passing of time? The Shaytaan made this attractive to those who are misled, so they took the day of ‘Aashooraa’ as an occasion of mourning, when they grieve and wail, recite poems of grief and tell stories filled with lies. Whatever truth there may be in these stories serves no purpose other than the renewal of their grief and sectarian feeling, and the stirring up of hatred and hostility among the Muslims, which they do by cursing those who came before them, and telling many lies, and causing much trouble in the world. The various sects of Islam have never known any group tell more lies or cause more trouble or help the kuffaar against the Muslims more than this misguided and evil group. They are even worse than the Khawaarij who went beyond the pale of Islam. They are the ones of whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “They will kill the people of Islam and will leave alone the people who worship idols.” This group cooperated with the Jews, Christians and mushrikeen against the members of the Prophet’s household and his believing ummah, and also helped the mushrik Turks and Tatars to do what they did in Baghdaad and elsewhere to the descendents of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), i.e., the ‘Abbaasid rulers and others, and the believers; the Turks and Tatars killed them, enslaved their women and destroyed their homes. The evil and harm that they do to the Muslims cannot be enumerated by any man, no matter how eloquent he is. Some others – either Naasibis who oppose and have enmity towards al-Husayn and his family or ignorant people who try to fight evil with evil, corruption with corruption, lies with lies and bid’ah with bid’ah – opposed them by fabricating reports in favour of making the day of ‘Aashooraa’ a day of celebration, by wearing kohl and henna, spending money on one's children, cooking special dishes and other things that are done on Eids and special occasions. These people took the day of ‘Aashooraa’ as a festival like Eid, whereas the others took it as a day of mourning. Both are wrong, and both go against the Sunnah, even though the other group (the Rafidis) are worse in intention and more ignorant and more plainly wrong… But Allaah commands us to be just and to treat others well. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Those of you who live after my death will see many disputes. I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the sunnah of my rightly-guided successors (al-khulafa’ al-raashidoon) who come after me. Hold onto it as if biting it with your eyeteeth. Beware of newly-innovated matters, for every innovation is a going astray.” Neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) nor his rightly-guided successors (the khulafa’ al-raashidoon) did any of these things on the day of ‘Aashooraa’, they neither made it a day of mourning nor a day of celebration. But “when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah, he saw the Jews fasting on the day of ‘Aashooraa’. He said, ‘What is this?’ They said, ‘This is the day when Allaah saved Moosa from drowning, so we fast on this day.’ He said, ‘We have more right to Moosa than you,’ so he fasted on that day and commanded [the Muslims] to fast on that day.” Quraysh also used to venerate this day during the Jaahiliyyah. The day on which people were ordered to fast was just one day. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Madeenah it was Rabee’ al-Awwal, and the following year he fasted ‘Aashooraa’ and commanded the people to fast. Then in that year fasting in Ramadaan was made obligatory and fasting on ‘Aashooraa’ was abrogated. The scholars disputed as to whether fasting on that day (‘Aashooraa’) was waajib (obligatory) or mustahabb (encouraged). Of the two best known opinions, the more correct view is that it was waajib, then after that whoever fasted it did it because it was mustahabb. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not tell ordinary Muslims to fast on ‘Aashooraa’, but he used to say, “This is the day of ‘Aashooraa’; I am fasting on this day and whoever wishes to fast on this day may fast.” And he said: “Fasting on ‘Aashooraa’ expiates for the sins of one year and fasting on the day of ‘Arafaah expiates for the sins of two years.” When, towards the end of his life, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) heard that the Jews took the day of ‘Aashooraa’ as a festival, he said, “If I live until next year, I will certainly fast on the ninth” – to be different from the Jews, and not to resemble them in taking the day as a festival. There were some of the Sahaabah and scholars who did not fast on this day and did not regard it as mustahabb, but thought it makrooh to single out this day for fasting. This was reported from a group of the Koofiyeen (scholars of Kufa). Some other scholars said that it was mustahabb to fast on this day. The correct view is that it is mustahabb for the one who fasts on ‘Aashooraa’ to fast on the ninth day [of Muharram] too, because this was the ultimate command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as he said: “If I live until next year, I will certainly fast on the ninth as well as the tenth.” This was reported with a variety of isnaads. This is what is prescribed in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). As for the other things, such as cooking special dishes with or without grains, or wearing new clothes, or spending money on one’s family, or buying the year’s supplies on that day, or doing special acts of worship such as special prayers or deliberately slaughtering an animal on that day, or saving some of the meat of the sacrifice to cook with grains, or wearing kohl and henna, or taking a bath (ghusl), or shaking hands with one another, or visiting one another, or visiting the mosques and mashhads (shrines) and so on… all of this is reprehensible bid’ah and is wrong. None of it has anything to do with the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or the way of the Khulafa’ al-Raashidoon. It was not approved of by any of the imaams of the Muslims, not Maalik, not al-Thawri, not al-Layth ibn Sa’d, not Abu Haneefah, not al-Oozaa’i, not al-Shaafa'i, not Ahmad ibn Hanbal, not Ishaaq ibn Raahwayh, not any of the imaams and scholars of the Muslims. The religion of Islam is based on two principles: that we should worship nothing besides Allaah Alone, and that we should worship Him in the manner that He has prescribed, not by means of bid’ah or reprehensible innovations. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “… So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.” [al-Kahf 18:110]. Righteous deeds are those which are loved by Allaah and His Messenger, those which are prescribed in Islam and in the Sunnah. Thus ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (may Allaah be pleased with him) used to say in his du’aa’: “O Allaah, make all of my deeds righteous and make them purely for Your sake, and do not let there be any share for anyone or anything else in them.” (The above is summarized from the words of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah – may Allaah have mercy on him. Al-Fataawa al-Kubra, part 5). And Allaah is the Guide to the Straight Path. For more information, please see the answers to questions No. (21775 ) and (303756 ). And Allah knows best.\n",

Ahmad said concerning a Jew or Christian whose daughter becomes Muslim: ‘He cannot travel with her, he is not a mahram for her.’ Apparently he meant that he is not her mahram for the purposes of travelling. As far as looking is concerned, she does not have to wear hijab in front of him, because Abu Sufyaan came to Madeenah at the time when he was still a mushrik, and visited his daughter Umm Habeebah. She folded up the Prophet’s bed so that he would not sit on it, but she did not wear hijab in front of him, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not command her to do so.” (al-Mughni, part 7, Ahkaam al-Khutbah).\n",

The reason is that there is no difference of religion between the spouses. Abu Dawood reported from Ibn ‘Abbaas that a man came to declare his Islam at the time of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then his wife came to declare her Islam. [The man] said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, she became Muslim when I did.’ So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) returned her to him.” (al-Mughni, part 7, Ahkaam al-Nikaah).

      "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen: A woman says, I want to become Muslim, and my husband is good and I do not want to leave him. What should I do? He answered: “She has to leave him, but is it possible for her to call him to Islam? She could say, ‘I want to become Muslim, but if I become Muslim, the marriage will become null and void unless you become Muslim too.’ Hopefully if she says this to him, he will become Muslim too.’” Question: If she become Muslim, can she stay in the marital home while she calls him to Islam, or should she leave? Answer: “If she is hopeful that he will become Muslim, she can stay in the marital home until the end of her ‘iddah (waiting period following the dissolution of a marriage).” Question: Can she uncover herself (go without hijab) during the ‘iddah or not? Answer: “To be on the safe side, she should not uncover, because there is no certainty that he will agree to become Muslim.” Question: And she should not be alone with him? Answer: “And she should not be alone with him.” Question: If telling her about this could turn her away from Islam, is it permissible for us according to sharee’ah to conceal the second part of the answer from her, so that we could tell her, “Become Muslim first, then we will tell you about the ruling on staying with your husband”? Answer: “No, if we say this, and then we tell her about the ruling and she leaves Islam (becomes an apostate), this will make the problem worse. For this reason the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told ‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib, when he sent him to the people of Khaybar: ‘Call them to Islam and tell them what they have to do in the way of duties towards Allaah.’” Question: So now if she continues to live with him after she becomes Muslim she is guilty of a major sin (kabeerah)? Answer: “Yes that is the case, but she should not persist in zinaa (unlawful sexual relationship).” Question: Briefly, how should we answer her? Answer: “Tell her: Become Muslim, and know that if you become Muslim and your husband does not, the marriage will become null and void.” When we are talking to women who will be faced with this issue, we should focus on the following points: Giving priority to love for Allaah and His Messenger over love for anyone else. If she is sincere in calling him to Islam and in praying for him, Allaah may guide him at her hands. -Whoever gives up something for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will compensate him or her with something better. Allaah will never forsake His slave who gives up something he or she loves for His sake. When a woman like this becomes Muslim and leaves her husband, one of the Muslim brothers should come forward to marry her and take her children into his family, or good-hearted Muslims should undertake the responsibility of spending in charity on her and her children. We ask Allaah to guide us and grant us strength and help us to do the right thing. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly the free adult person who is of sound mind and discernment is permitted to dispose of his own wealth with no restrictions as long as he is alive, whether he is buying, renting, giving a gift, establishing a waqf (endowment) or any other kind of transaction. There is no dispute among the scholars on this point. There is also no dispute among the scholars concerning the fact that the husband does not have the right to object to the way his wife handles her wealth in transactions such as buying, renting, etc., if the woman is of sound mind and there is no reason why she should not handle her own money and she is not one of those who may be tricked. (Muraatib al-Ijmaa li Ibn Hazm, 162; al-Ijmaa fil-Fiqh al-Islami, Abu Habeeb, 2/566). But the scholars differed as to whether a woman has the right to give all or some of her wealth in charity or as a gift without the permission of her husband. The details of their opinions are as follows: The first opinion: The husband has the right to prevent her from giving if the amount is more than one third of her wealth, but he does not have this right with regard to lesser amounts. This is the opinion of the Malikis and Hanbalis, and one of the two views narrated from Ahmad. (Sharh al-Khurashi, 7/103; al-Mughni, 4/513; Nayl al-Awtaar, 6/22). The evidence for this is reports and qiyaas (analogy). Among the reports referred to are the following: The report that Khayrah, the wife of Kab ibn Maalik, came to the Prophet with some jewellery of hers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: It is not permissible for a woman [to dispose of] her wealth without the permission of her husband. Have you asked Kabs permission? She said, Yes. So the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent for Kab ibn Maalik, her husband, and asked him, Have you given permission to Khayrah to give her jewellery in charity? He said, Yes, so the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted it from her. (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2380; its isnaad includes Abd-Allaah ibn Yahya and his father, who are majhool (not known, i.e., not enough information is known about them to ascertain whether they are trustworthy)). The report narrated from Umar ibn Shuayb from his father from his grandfather that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in a khutbah (sermon) he gave: It is not permissible for a woman to give anything except with the permission of her husband. (Sunan Abi Dawood, Buyoo, Baab 84; Sunan al-Nisaai, Zakaah, Baab 58; Musnad Ahmad, 2/179; Sunan Ibn Maajah, 2/798). According to another version: A woman has no right to her money if she is married. (Reported by five, except al-Tirmidhi). These reports are taken as evidence that a woman does not have the right to spend her money except with her husbands permission, which means that the husbands permission is a condition any time she wants to spend; his right to stop her spending is limited to amounts over one-third of her wealth, because there are reports that indicate that the owner has the right to dispose of one-third or less of his wealth in his will, but he does not have the right to dispose of more than that without the permission of his heirs. This is seen in the famous story of Sad ibn Abi Waqqaas, who asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if he could give all of his wealth in charity, and he said, No. Sad asked, What about two-thirds? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, No. Sad said, What about half? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, No. Sad said, What about a third? The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, [Yes,] a third, but a third is still a lot. (Agreed upon) With regard to their using qiyaas (analogy) as evidence, they say that the husbands rights are connected to the wifes wealth, on the basis of the hadeeth: A woman may be married for her wealth, her beauty or her religious commitment. (Reported by the seven scholars). Usually a husband increases his mahr because of the wifes wealth, and he will be able to spend her money, and if he cannot afford to spend on her, she will not complain (because she has her own money). This is similar to the rights of heirs in relation to a sick person's wealth. (al-Mughni, 4/514). The second opinion: The husband has the right to stop his wife from spending in all cases, whether it is a small amount or a large amount, except in the case of insignificant things. This is the opinion of al-Layth ibn Sad. (Nayl al-Awtaar, 6/22). The third opinion: The woman is not allowed to spend anything of her wealth at all, except with the permission of her husband. This is the opinion of Taawoos (Fath al-Baari, 5/218). Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath, and Taawoos used as evidence, the hadeeth of Umar ibn Shuayb, It is not permissible for a woman to give anything of her own wealth except with the permission of her husband. This was reported by Abu Dawood and al-Nisaai. Ibn Battaal said: The hadeeth narrated in this chapter are more sound. The fourth opinion: The woman has the right to spend her own money in all circumstances, whether in a transaction or otherwise, whether this involves all of her wealth or part of it. This is the opinion of the majority, and is the opinion of the Hanafis, Shaafais and Hanbalis, and of Ibn al-Mundhir. (al-Mughni, 4/513; al-Ansaaf, 5/342; Maaani al-Athaar, 4/354; al-Baari, 5/318; al-Awtaar, 6/22). This is the soundest opinion, and is most in accordance with the Quraan, the Sunnah and common sense. In the Quraan, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And give to the women (whom you marry) their Mahr (obligatory bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) with a good heart, but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful).[al-Nisa 4:4] Allaah allows the husband to take what his wife gives him willingly. Allaah also says (interpretation of the meaning): And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have appointed unto them the mahr (bridal money given by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (mahr), unless the women agree to forego it[al-Baqarah 2:237] Here Allaah allows women to give up as much of the mahr as they wish if their husbands divorce them, without them having to ask permission from anybody. This indicates that women have the right to decide what to do with their own money, and that a woman has rights to her wealth just as a man has rights to his wealth. (Sharh al-Maaani al-Athaar, 4/352). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And try orphans (as regards their intelligence) until they reach the age of marriage; if then you find sound judgement in them, release their property to them [al-Nisa 4:6] This clearly means that when the female orphan becomes wise and discerning, she is allowed to handle her own wealth. Similarly, when the women gave their jewellery in charity after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had addressed them during his Eid sermon, this was an indication that they are allowed to dispose of their wealth without asking permission from anybody. (See Ittihaaf al-Khilaan bi Huqooq al-Zawjayn fil-Islam by Dr. Fayhaan ibn Ateeq al-Mutayri, pp. 92-96). It says in Nayl al-Awtaar: the majority of scholars agreed that women are allowed [to handle their own wealth] with no restrictions and without having to ask their husbands permission, so long as they are not foolish, but if they are foolish, it is not permitted. It says in al-Fath: The majority have a lot of evidence in the Quraan and Sunnah. The majority of scholars argued against those who used as evidence the hadeeth It is not permissible for a woman to give anything except with the permission of her husband. (Reported by Abu Dawood, 3079; Saheeh al-Jaami, 7265; some of its narrators have already been mentioned). The majority of scholars said that this has to do with the good manners and proper etiquette required of the wife because of the rights her husband has over her, and because of his status, experience in life and wisdom. Al-Sindi said in his commentary on al-Nisaai with regard to the hadeeth quoted: According to the majority of scholars, this has to do with good manners and making the husband feel good. It was reported from al-Shaafai that the hadeeth was not proven, so how can we use it as evidence when the Quraan, Sunnah, other reports and common sense indicate the opposite? Maymoonah freed a slave before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) knew anything about it, and he did not tell her off. This and other reports indicate that if this hadeeth is true, it is to be interpreted as being the matter of good manners, and the wife has the option either to ask her husbands permission or not. So the Muslim woman is encouraged to seek her husbands permission but it is not obligatory for her to do so and she will be rewarded for doing that. Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked, Which woman is the best? He said, The one who makes [her husband] happy when he looks at her, who obeys him when he tells her to do something, and who does not oppose him in a manner he dislikes with regard to herself and her wealth. (Reported by al-Nisaai, 3179; Saheeh al-Jaami, 3292). And Allaah knows best\n",

Secondly: a mother with AIDS taking care of her healthy child and breastfeeding him: Because current medical knowledge indicates that there is no definite risk to the child from a mother who has AIDS, because the way she deals with him is the ordinary way of mixing with people, from the point of view of sharee’ah, there is no reason why the mother should not take care of her child and breastfeed him, so long as there is no medical report to state that she should not do so.

If what is meant is that they recite it all together, in unison, pausing and stopping at the same time, then this is not prescribed in Islam and at the very least it is makrooh (disliked), because it is not reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or his Companions (may Allaah be pleased with them) did any such thing. But if this is done for the purpose of teaching, we hope that there is nothing wrong with it. If what is meant is that the people gather to recite Qur’aan in order to memorize and learn it, and each one recites whilst the others listen, or each one reads to himself – not in unison with the others – then this is permissible because it was reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “No group of people gathers in one of the houses of Allaah to recite the Book of Allaah and study it together, but tranquillity descends upon them, the angels surround them, mercy comes down upon them, and Allaah mentions them to those who are with Him.” (Reported by Muslim).\n",

If a person wants to learn medicine, for example, and studies medical books, he cannot learn anything from them unless he understands what they mean and it is explained to him. Indeed, he would very keen to understand what they say so that he can put it into practice. So how about the Book of Allaah which is healing for what is in people’s hearts and exhortation for all people? What about a person who reads it and does not understand or ponder its meanings? The Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) would not go beyond ten aayaat until they had learnt them and understood the knowledge therein and how to act upon it. A person will be rewarded for reading Qur’aan whether or not he understands it, but he should try his best to find out what it means and to seek this knowledge from scholars who can be trusted.

      "Praise be to Allah.Knowing the Beautiful Names of Allaah is very important indeed, for the following reasons: Knowledge of Allaah and His Names and Attributes is the noblest and best of all knowledge, because the level of honour of any kind of knowledge has to do with the object of knowledge, and the object of knowledge in this case is Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, through His Names, Attributes and Deeds. Occupying oneself with seeking this knowledge and studying it properly is the pursuit of the highest objective, and acquiring this knowledge is one of the best gifts a person may be given. Because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained it very clearly and was very keen to do so, the Sahaabah never disputed in this matter as they did over some of the rulings (ahkaam). Knowing Allaah makes a person love and fear Him, and put his hope in Him, and be sincere towards Him in his actions. This is the essence of human happiness. There is no way to know Allaah except by knowing His Most Beautiful Names and seeking a proper understanding of their meanings. Knowing Allaah by His Most Beautiful Names increases ones faith, as Shaykh Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Sadi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Believing in and knowing the Most Beautiful Names of Allaah includes the three types of Tawheed: Tawheed al-Ruboobiyyah (Unity of Divine Lordship), Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Unity of the Divine Nature) and Tawheed al-Asma wal-Sifaat (Unity of the Divine Names and Attributes). These three types of Tawheed form the essence and joy of faith (the word translated here as joy implies peace and relief from stress), and this knowledge is the basis and purpose of faith. The more a person learns about the Names and Attributes of Allaah, the more his faith increases and the stronger his conviction becomes. (Al-Tawdeeh wal-Bayaan li Shajarat al-Eemaan by al-Sadi, p. 41). Allaah created His creatures to know Him and worship Him. This is what is expected from them and what they are required to do, because as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The key to the call of the Messengers, the essence of their Message, is knowing Allaah through His Names and Attributes and Deeds, because this is the foundation on which the rest of the Message, from beginning to end, is built. (Al-Sawaaiq al-Mursalah ala al-Jahamiyyah wal-Muattilah by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/150-151). So when a person occupies himself with learning about Allaah, he is doing what he was created for, but if he ignores the matter, he is neglecting what he was created for. The meaning of faith is not merely to utter words without knowing Allaah, because true faith in Allaah means that the slave knows the Lord in Whom he believes, and he makes the effort to learn about Allaah through His Names and Attributes. The more he learns about his Lord, the more he increases in faith. Knowledge of the Names of Allaah is the basis for all other knowledge, as Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Knowledge of the Most Beautiful Names of Allaah is the basis of all other kinds of knowledge, for the objects of all these other branches of knowledge were either created or commanded by Him (the various branches of knowledge either deal with objects created by Him or with the laws and guidance revealed by Him). The reason for creation and guidance is found in His Most Beautiful Names (because He is the Creator, He creates things; because He is the Guide to the Straight Path, He reveals guidance, and so on) Knowing the Most Beautiful Names is the basis of all objects of knowledge, because all knowledge stems from these Names (Badai' al-Fawaaid by Ibn al-Qayyim, 1/163).\n",

This is a duty upon them, because we should refer things to Muslims for judgements. But with regard to the issue of giving up custody – if the mother gives up custody – this does not need the ruling of a judge. If she states that, this is sufficient for it to become binding. As for spending on the children, so long as they are going to go back to their father when the mother gives up her right to custody, he is going to spend on them anyway. Question: If the kaafir judge rules that the father has to spend on them whilst they are with their mother, is this considered to be binding? Answer: Even if the judge does not state that the father has to spend on them, it is still his obligation according to sharee’ah. Question: But the amount? Answer: The amount is to be determined by ‘Urf (local custom). Question: So if the amount stipulated by the kaafir judge is in accordance with ‘Urf, is it binding on him? Answer: It is binding on him not because it is the ruling of the judge but because it is ‘Urf. Question: If the husband and wife agree to refer to a Muslim for judgement, is his ruling binding on them? In the West, the imaam may be a person who is not religious, so can they refer to him for judgement? Answer: If there is no one else available, then it is OK, but the fuqaha’ have stated the condition that he should be fit to judge, meaning that he should have knowledge of sharee’ah, but if there is no one else, let them fear Allaah as much as they can. Question: There may be no one there at all who knows about passing judgement, but if there is a wise Muslim man? Answer: If they ask him to judge between them on the basis that he is going to bring about a reconciliation, this is OK. Question: But if we say that it is only for reconciliation, his words will not be binding? Answer: No, but if he passes a judgement and they agree to it, then it will become binding. Every reconciliation that the two parties agree to is binding because of the hadeeth: “Reconciliation is permissible among Muslims”. And Allaah knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Muhammad Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen, who replied as follows: “If the Muslim students agree on something, this is OK, but if each Muslim group is adopting its own symbol, it is not right. The symbol or color that we recommend is bright green.” Is there any daleel (evidence) for this color? “No, but people like this color and in the Qur’aan it says (interpretation of the meanings): ‘Their garments will be of fine green silk’ [al-Insaan 76:21] and ‘Reclining on green cushions’ [al-Rahmaan 55:76].” Is there any indication from the reports that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had white and black banners that these colors are mustahabb in such cases? “No, we cannot use these colors, because these were the banners in that time, and each era has things that are appropriate for it. But black now is one of the symbols of the Raafidah, as is well known.” The crescent is commonly used as a symbol by Muslims to distinguish themselves from Christian groups who use the cross as a symbol. Is it permissible for us to use the crescent as a symbol in our publications and on our banners, to distinguish ourselves from other, non-Muslim groups? “I do not think this is right, because the crescent was originally a symbol that was placed on graves that were worshipped instead of Allah. We read this in an answer given by some scholars and leaders of Daw’ah. But we could use a picture of the Ka’bah as a symbol, because it is the Qiblah of all Muslims.” In some countries they put a crescent on Muslim places of worship to distinguish them from Christian places of worship, which have crosses on top of them. They do this so that people can tell them apart from a distance, because the architecture is often similar. Can we say that putting a crescent on the mosques or minarets of the Muslims is bid’ah? “It is as you say (i.e., we can say that). It is sufficient for a mosque not to have a Christian symbol on it. Symbols may be something that is present, or something that is not present. If the Christians have a symbol, namely the cross, then the fact that the Muslims have no symbol is in itself a symbol. (i.e., we do not need to put anything). And Allâh knows best.\n",

      "Praise be to Allah.What you and anyone else who finds valuable lost property should do is to announce it for one full year in the places where people gather, two or three times each month. If it is identified by the owner, then hand it over to him, otherwise the finder can keep it after one year, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) gave instructions to this effect. An exception is made in the case of lost property found in Al-Haramayn (Makkah and Madeenah) – the finder cannot keep it, and it should be announced indefinitely until its owner is found, or the finder can hand it over to the authorities in charge of the Haramayn so that they can keep it for the owner, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning Makkah, “Property lost in Makkah is not permissible for anyone except its owner.” And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I have made Madeenah sacred just as Ibraaheem made Makkah sacred.” The authenticity of the Hadeeth is agreed upon. But if the property is of insignificant value and the owner will not be bothered about it, such as a rope or shoelace or a small amount of money, then the finder does not have to announce it, and he can make use of it or give it in charity on behalf of the owner. This does not apply in the case of lost camels and other animals that are safe from small predators such as wolves etc.. It is not permissible to keep these animals, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to the one who asked him about that: “Leave it alone, for it has its feet and its water, and it can eat the trees until it finds its owner.” (Agreed upon). And Allaah is the source of strength.\n",
