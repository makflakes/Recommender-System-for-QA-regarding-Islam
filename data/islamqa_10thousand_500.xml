    <title>Interruption of Wudhu</title>
    <question>If during wudhu (ablution), one finds dirt stuck on his fingers, does working on removing the dirt by scrubbing it off disrupt the continuity of the wudhu and require repeating it?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Continuity would not be disrupted by such an action (according to the most viable opinion) even if his body had dried, because he was delayed due to an action required for his purity. The same is true if he were to move from one faucet to another in search of water. However, if continuity were disrupted due to an action not related to this, like removing impurity from his clothes, eating or drinking and the like, and the limbs became dry, then he needs to repeat the wudhu.

    <title>Time of occurence of janaba unknown.</title>
    <question>If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and several prayers have passed, what should he do?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If a man sees the signs of sexual discharge impurity (janaba) on his clothes, and he is not sure when the discharge occurred, and he had performed several prayers (salaat) not knowing, he has to perform major ablution (ghusl) and repeat the salaat from the most recent sleep in which he was wearing this clothes. However, if he finds out that the janaba was from a previous sleep, then he should repeat salaat from the last sleep he thinks the janaba occurred1. The references (adillah) on the religious duty of performing ghusl due to janaba in preparation for salaat are many, one of which is Allah's command in the Qur'an, a translated meaning of which is: &quot;O' You who believe, do not get approach salaat while you are drunk until you know what you are saying, nor while impure due to sexual discharge (junob) unless you are traveling about until you perform ghusl&quot; (4:43). And Ali's narration (hadith), (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said &quot;I was a man with frequent urethral discharge, so I kept performing ghusl until the skin of my back started cracking, so I mentioned this to the Prophet peace be upon him (or it was mentioned to him) so the messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &quot;Don't do ghusl if you see urethral discharge, just wash your male organ and perform wudu' same as wudu' of salaat. If semen appears, then perform ghusl&quot;2. This hadith indicates that appearance of semen requires ghusl whereas urethral discharge only needs washing of the sexual organ followed by wudu'.From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situtations...? 1 Al-Mughni ma'a al-Sharh il-Kabeer 1/199. 2 Narrated by Abu Dawood number 206 and verified sahih by Albani in Arwaa' al-Ghaleel number 125.</answer>

    <title>Is Circumcision Necessary for Conversion?</title>
    <question>A lawyer in Argentina is asking about the ruling on circumcision for a disbelieving man or woman who wants to enter Islam.</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Male circumcision in Islam Is male circumcision mandatory in Islam? Is circumcision necessary for conversion to Islam? Praise be to Allah.Thank you for submitting this question. The issue of circumcision is one of the issues which in several cases forms a barrier for some of those who want to enter the religion of Islam. The matter is easier than many people think. Male circumcision in Islam As for circumcision, it is one of the symbols of Islam. It is part of sound human nature (fitrah), and is part of the way of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], to follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth. [an-Nahl 16:123] The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: The prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) circumcised himself when he was eighty years old (Narrated by al-Bukhari, 6/388) Is male circumcision mandatory in Islam? Circumcision is obligatory for a Muslim man, if he is able to do it. If he is not able to do it, such as if he fears that he may die if he is circumcised, or if a trustworthy doctor has told him that it will lead to haemorrhaging that may cause his death, then he is exempt from circumcision in that case, and he is not sinning if he does not do it. Is circumcision necessary for conversion to Islam? It is not appropriate under any circumstances to let the issue of circumcision be a barrier that prevents a person from entering the faith; rather the soundness of a persons Islam does not depend upon him being circumcised. A persons entering the religion of Islam is valid even if he does not get circumcised . With regard to the issue of female circumcision, you will find the answer in question no. 427 . I ask Allah to enable you to do all that is good and to protect you from all that is evil. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>When Can You Pray After a Miscarriage?</title>
    <question>If a woman has a miscarriage and has discharge of blood, does she pray?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.This case depends on the type of blood. Is the blood what is known as post-natal bleeding (nifas) or vaginal bleeding (istihadah ) (but not part of her regular period)? The scholars have declared the regulation in this matter. They said: &quot;If she sees the blood after the abortion of a formed human being, then it is nifas; if she sees blood after the abortion of a clot, then it is not nifas.&quot; (Al-Mughni ma' al-Sharh al-Kabir 1/361) In the latter case, she is considered to be mustahada, so she performs wudu for every prayer when the time for it is due and she prays. Whereas if the aborted object is a fetus or has human-formed organs like an arm or a leg or a head, then it is considered nifas. For the case where the aborted object is disposed of in the hospital before the woman saw it, the scholars have mentioned that the least amount of time human form starts to take place is eighty one days after pregnancy. (Majmu Fatawa Ibn Uthaymin 4/292) This is based on the report of Abdullah Bin Masud's hadith (may Allah be pleased with him), in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) spoke to us, and he is the truthful and believed one, and said: &quot;Each one of you, human creation, forms in his mother's womb for forty days, then he is a hanging clot for the same amount of time, then he is a mudghah (the size of a morsel) for the same amount of time, then Allah sends an angel who is commanded with four things: he is told to write his deeds, his livelihood and sustenance, whether he is happy or distressed &quot; (Sahih al-Buhari 6/303) Ladies in this case should spend the effort to find out from the doctors' estimations until her situation is clear to her. As for the blood that is discharged just prior to a normal delivery, if it is accompanied with the pains of contraction, then it is nifas, and if not, then it is not. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah (may the mercy of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;What she sees when the contractions commence is nifas. What is referred to here is contractions after which follows delivery; otherwise it is not nifas.&quot; (Majmu Fatawa Ibn Uthaymin 4/327) Reference: What Should You Do in the Following Situations by Sheikh Muhammad Salih Al-Munajjid.</answer>

    <answer>Contents Related Satanic whispers during prayer Tips on how to stay focused in prayer Praise be to Allah.Satanic whispers during prayer This happened to one of the Companions of the Prophet (blessings and peace be upon him) whose name is Uthman ibn Abi Al-As, (may Allah be pleased with him). Uthman came complaining to the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him), and said: &quot;The Shaytan comes between me and my prayer and causes me problems with my recitation.&quot; So the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;That is a Shaytan called Khanzab , so if you feel his presence, seek refuge in Allah and blow a mist to your left three times.&quot; He said: &quot;I applied this advice and Allah has rid me of him. (Sahih Muslim, 2203) Tips on how to stay focused in prayer This hadith includes two ways on how to get rid of the shaytan while praying . Seeking refuge in Allah from the Shaytan's evil by pronouncing the words of seeking refuge and this is OK in this case. Blowing with mist to the left three times. This is basically blowing air in a similar manner to spitting, but with a minute mist of saliva, on the condition that this does not disturb or bother the person next to him, nor make the masjid dirty.

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If he knows without doubt that wind has passed, then he should leave the prayer. However, if he is in doubt but is not certain, then he should not leave unless he becomes certain--by hearing the wind pass or smelling it.

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Yes, if the call to prayer was during his witr, he should complete the prayer and he is excused. This matter is part of the case of the timing of witr prayer: i.e., does witr end at the start of the timing of the fajr prayer or at the end of the timing of the fajr prayer?

    <title>How to pray if not sure imam is traveling or resident</title>
    <question>If a traveling person comes upon a congregation praying, and he does not know if: (1) the imam (prayer leader) is a traveler, meaning that he should join the prayer with the intention of qasr (shortening prayer), or (2) if he is resident, and thus should pray the complete prayer, what should he do?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The answer that is apparent is: he acts based on what is clear to him from the signs of travel on the imam from clothes or travel gear. If it appears to him that the imam is resident, then he should pray the complete prayer. The evidence: what Imam Ahmad authenticated and narrated that Ibn Abbas was asked: &quot;What is reason that the traveler prays two rakaat (iterations of prayer) if he is alone and four rakaat if he is led in [a full] prayer by a resident? So he said, that is the sunna (tradition of the Prophet ), and in another narration &quot;That is the sunna of Abi Al-Qasim.&quot; Take the case of one who assumes that the imam is a traveler, and thus prays with him two rakaat with intention of qasr. Then, after salaam (completion of prayer) with the imam, it becomes clear to him [from speaking with others after the prayer, for example] that the imam is actually a resident and that the two rakaat that he had prayed were the imams third and fourth. In such an instance, he should stand up and make two rakaat to complete the prayer, he makes sujood sahw (an extra two prostrations). Whatever speaking was done or questions asked to investigate do not harm his prayer.1 From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations... ? 1 Al-Majmooa lil-Nawawi 4/356</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Ibn Qudama, (may the mercy of Allah be upon him), said: &quot;As soon as the ill person during prayer is able to do what he was not able to do when he commenced the prayer, whether it be standing, sitting, bowing, prostrating, or bowing, then he should move on and build on what has been already completed from his prayer. The same if he began the prayer completely capable of performing all actions, then suddenly became unable to perform certain actions. In this case he continues praying in the best shape he can and builds on what he previously had completed as though nothing has changed in his condition.&quot;1 The evidence is: hadith Umran Bin Hossayn, (may Allah be pleased with him), who said, &quot;I had bawaseer (hemorrhoids) so I asked the Prophet (peace be upon him), about salaat, and he said: 'Pray standing up; if you cannot, then sitting down; if you can not, then on your side.' &quot;2 From the book What Should You Do in the Following Situations... ? 1 Al-Mughni maa al-Sharh al-Kabeer 1/782, and likewise in Al-Majmooa lil-Nawawi 4/318. 2 Sunan Abu Dawood 922 and Sahih Sunan Abu Dawood 815</answer>

    <title>Repentance (tawbah) from murder</title>
    <question>How does a murderer repent for his sin?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.A murderer has three rights on him. That of Allah, that of the murdered person, and those of his or her immediate kin. As for Allah's right it cannot be requited but with true repentance. The right of the immediate kin can be requited by the murderer by handing himself over to them in order that they either: a) turn him over to the authorities for execution; b) accept monetary compensation from him; or c) forgive him. The right of the person himself who was murdered cannot be compensated for in this world. Some scholars are of the opinion - and this seems to be the preferable opinion - that if the murderer is true in his repentance, Allah will clear him of his sin and compensate on his behalf by satisfying the person murdered on the Day of Judgment.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The scholars have expressed different opinions. The moderate and most just opinion is that you return the entire original sum to the orphans plus half of the profits, as if you and they had been partners with their capital and your labor, hence the division. This ruling has come from Imam AHED. It is also the opinion of Ibn Taymiyya which his pupil Imam Ibn ul-Qayyim prefers.

    <answer>Praise be to Allah. He who has done business in things that are prohibited in Islam, such as musical instruments, prohibited cassettes, cigarettes etc. while knowing the ruling on them then wishes to repent, needs to give away in charity all the profits he made from them. This will be a means of purification and will not be counted as spending in the way of Allah, for Allah is pure and does not accept but the pure. Further, if this money gets mixed up with other earnings, as in the case of a shop owner who sells many other items, then if he can compute the amount of profits made from them, he should do so in the hope of purifying the rest of his earnings. In other words, he who has some money earned through unlawful means and intends to repent, should: 1- If he was an unbeliever at the time of earning the money, he is not obliged to atone for them or seek their purification. For the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not demand from his followers that they purify their wealth after coming into the fold of Islam. 2- If he was Muslim at the time of earning the money, well aware of its Islamic ban and prohibition, then he should separate it out at the time of repentance.</answer>

    <question>A man used to accept bribes. Then Allah guided him to righteousness. What should he do with what he used to earn as bribes?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There can be two situations. Either the bribes he used to accept were from those that had been wronged who had to offer bribes as a means of obtaining what was their right, in which case the repentant should return them their amounts or articles or whatever, for what he took from them is considered as having been taken by force or through deceit. Or, the bribe was taken from an unjust (zalim) man like he was himself before he repented. That is, someone who achieved or attained things via bribes which were not his right. This amount is not to be returned to him. Instead the repentant should spend it in a charitable way, such as on the poor and the destitute. Likewise, he must repent from the harm he caused to people by giving their right away to others who had no right to them, but rather obtained them via the use of bribes.

    <title>Money earned from doing forbidden things</title>
    <question>I used to do forbidden things and get paid for them. Now I have repented. Do I have to return the amounts thus earned?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Yes, one who commits haram (forbidden) deeds and accepts payments for them, should get rid of the amounts earned from them when he repents. But such amounts should not be returned to those who paid them. For instance, when a call-girl repents, she should not return her wages of sin to her customers. When a singer repents he should not return the wages he earned to the band to which he belonged or the party which paid. When a man who used to sell wine or drugs repents he should not return the amounts to those who used to buy from him. Nor should he who used to swear for others as a false witness return the amounts he earned to those for whose benefit he used to swear. The reason being that if he returns the amounts to him who paid, then he will be depositing with him both the unlawful money as well as the unlawful commodity that he took through bribe or wages of sin. Therefore it will be enough if he gets rid of such unlawful earning himself. This is the preference of Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah as well as his pupil Ibn ul-Qayyim as stated in his Madarij.</answer>

    <title>Using clothing of the kuffar (unbelievers)</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on using clothing of the kuffar (unbelievers)?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The use of clothing of the kuffar (unbelievers) which they have worn is permissible as long as there is no known najasa (impurity) regarding it, because the default for things in general is tahaarah (purity) and it is not overridden by mere doubt. Likewise, what they have woven and dyed and what has been imported from their countries are also permissible, as long as they do not comprise anything haram (forbidden), because the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his sahaba (his companions) wore items the kuffar had woven and made, and likewise the Prophet (peace be upon him) wore a Roman jubba (a long outer garment, open in front, with wide sleeves).</answer>

    <title>Repentance From Fornication and Status of Child</title>
    <question>There is another problem that has been worrying me for some timenamely, I committed fornication with a woman. How do I repent? Can I marry her in order to cover up the whole affair?

Another man says he committed fornication outside his country, and he knows that the woman conceived and delivered a child. Is this his child? And is it obligatory for him to bear the costs of the childs upbringing?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Questions of this sort are asked so often and by so many that it is time Muslims paid serious attention to their reformation in the light of the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings), in order that such things do not occur in the first place. Special stress is to be placed on the lowering of the gaze, no bodily contact (including shaking hands) between men and women, wearing of the full hijab (womens Islamic dress code), prohibition of meetings in secrecy in particular and of mixing of sexes in general, discouraging unwarranted travel to non-Muslim countries, and early marriages. As for the question about one who committed fornication, there can be two situations. Either the man did it by force, that is, raped the woman. Such a man should pay her the amount of mahr (dower) in accordance with her social class, as compensation for what harm he caused her. As for himself, he should sincerely repent. And, if the matter has reached the authorities, then he should be punished according to the law of shariah (Islamic law). See Madarij. Or, he has had sex with a woman who consented to the act. There is nothing due from such a man except repentance. Neither the child is his, nor is the cost of upbringing born by him because it is an illegal child and must be attached to the mother and not the father. The mans marriage to the woman, for the sake of covering up the issue, is also not permissible. For Allah revealed in the Quran a verse whose meaning can be translated as: An adulterer does not marry but an adulteress or mushrika (female polytheist). And an adulteress does not marry but an adulterer or mushrik (male polytheist). (24:3) It is also not permissible to marry a woman who is pregnant from an adulterous act, even if the man has fathered the baby in the womb, as it is also not permissible to marry a woman about whom it is not known if she is pregnant or not. Nonetheless, if he repents, and she also repents, and she is not carrying a child, then it is permissible for him to marry her and begin a new life. If she is carrying a child, they must wait until she gives birth. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <question>A woman says she married a virtuous man. But she had committed things before marriage that Allah disapproves of. Now her conscience pricks her. She would like to know if it is necessary for her to confess to her husband what she used to do before marriage?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.No, it is not necessary for either of the two spouses to inform the other of what they used to do before their marriage. Let he or she who happens to have fallen in such evils conceal himself or herself just as Allah has concealed them. A true repentance should suffice. As for he who married a virgin, but it became apparent to him at consummation that she is not so for reasons of promiscuity committed before marriage, then he has the to take back the mahr (dower) he paid her and separate from her. Nevertheless, if he finds that she has truly repented, then if he keeps it confidential and conceals the matter and retains her in marriage, surely he will be rewarded for it by Allah.</answer>

    <title>What to do With Forbidden Items after Repentance</title>
    <question>I have repented. But in my possession are some forbidden things such as musical instruments, cassettes, films, etc. Is it permissible for me to sell them, particularly since they are worth a large amount?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Sale of such banned articles is not permissible in Islam. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When Allah forbids a thing, then He forbids its price (as well). (i.e., its sale/purchase/trading.) [Abu Dawood, and it is authentic] Also, you know well that whomever you sell it to will use it in a forbidden act; thus, it is not permissible for you to sell it to him as Allah has prohibited this in commanding us (in meaning): do not assist one another in sins and enmity. And no matter how much you lose in worldly wealth, have faith that what is in store with Allah is worthier and longer lasting. He will compensate you with His grace, and His favor and His generosity.

    <title>Repentance from Spreading Anti-Islamic Materials</title>
    <question>I was a misguided person spreading secularist ideologies, and writing heretical stories and articles, and using my poetry as a vehicle to spread corruption and liberalism. Then Allah turned to me with His mercy and brought me forth from darkness into light. How should I repent?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This of course is a great blessing of Allah and a favor. We pray to Allah that He grant you perseverance. As for those who were engaged with their tongue and their pen in a war against Islam by spreading distorted ideologies and doctrines, or by spreading misguided innovations and corruption, the following is incumbent upon them: Announce their repentance and renounce all that they used to spread in antagonism to Islam, in order that the renunciation becomes well known, and so that no one can claim to be misguided by their disowned writings. This renunciation is an obligation and is a precondition for the acceptance of repentance. Allah says (what means): Save for those who repent, make amends and show clearly [what they used to say/rule wrongly], it is from those whom I accept their repentance, and I am very Forgiving, very Compassionate. [2:160] The tafseer (explanation) for this verse indicates that it was revealed regarding the scholars of ahl ul-kitab (People of the Book) who used to conceal what had been revealed regarding the signs of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the commands to believe in him. The repentant person should now engage themselves in the spread of the truth of Islam, spending their energies in defense of its teachings, and educating people in their religion. They should use their power of speech or writing to counterattack the forces of falsehood, to expose their deceits, plans and strategies, even as he used to co-operate with them in opposing Islam, and thus become a sword in the defense of Islam. It is also binding on he who convinced another man, even if in a private meeting, against things declared haram (forbidden) by Islam, such as, for instance, taking interest, to get in touch with the person he was instrumental in changing his opinion and let him know of his own renewed enlightenment.

    <title>Can You Pray the Same Salah Twice?</title>
    <question>If a person has already prayed in a mosque then goes to another one and finds people there praying the congregational prayer, should he pray again?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.If a person prays in a mosque and then goes to another one to attend a lecture or for any other reason, and finds the people there praying, then he should join them and his prayer would be considered a supererogatory (nafilah, nafl, tatawwu) prayer . He should do so even if it is during the prohibited times of prayer because there is a reason behind it. The evidence for this comes from what has been narrated in the hadith of Yazid bin Al-Aswad (may Allah be pleased with him) in Sunan Al-Tirmidhi in the chapter on What has been reported about a person who prayed alone and then joins a congregation: He said: I performed Hajj with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and prayed Fajr with him in Masjid Al-Khayf. When he completed his prayer and turned around, he found two people who did not pray with him. He said: I have to talk to them. So he came to them and they were trembling. He asked them: What prevented you two from praying with us? They said: O Prophet of Allah! We had already prayed in our places. He said: Do not do that. If you already prayed at your places and then came to a congregational mosque, pray with them too and it will become a supererogatory prayer for you. (Sunan Al-Tirmidhi, No. 219; Sahih Al-Jami, No. 667) In another hadith it is narrated that the two came after the Fajr prayer which is a prohibited time for prayer. Imam Malik has reported in Muwatta in the chapter on What has been narrated about repeating the prayer with the Imam after a person has prayed individually: Mihjan (may Allah be pleased with him), says that he was in the company of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) prayed in congregation and returned while Mihjan himself did not pray with them. So the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: What prevented you from praying with the people? Are you not a Muslim? He said: Indeed, O Prophet of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)! But I had already prayed at home. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him: When you come (to the mosque) then pray with the people even if you have prayed.

    <title>Informed about correct direction of qiblah during prayer</title>
    <question>What should one who is informed about the correct direction of the qiblah during a prayer?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If there is a congregation praying, and during their prayer they are informed about the right direction of qiblah, they should all turn towards the correct direction. The same is also true for someone praying individually. Whatever part of their prayer has been performed (before changing direction) will be correct. The evidence for this a narration by Imam Muslim from Anas (may Allah be please with him), that: While the Prophet (peace be upon him) was praying towards Bayt-al-Maqdis (Jerusalem), the verse was revealed to him (translation of meaning): Verily! We have seen the turning of your face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a qiblah that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram. (Al-Baqarah, 2:144). A man from Bani Salamah was passing by and found them (i.e., the people of Bani Salamah) in the state of ruku in the Fajr prayer in the second rakah. He shouted to them: Indeed the qiblah has been changed. So, turn to the qiblah as they (i.e., the Prophet and his Companions) have. (Sahih Musim, No. 527) If some of the people were informed and the others were not, then the one to whom it was made clear should turn to the direction he believes to be the correct direction of qiblah. Now if all of these people (who were informed or not) were originally praying together in the same direction, and some of them turned towards right and some towards left, it is correct for some to follow others. But the scholars have a difference of opinion about some people following others in the situation where there was complete disagreement (among the praying people) about the direction of the qiblah. If there was someone among them who was completely ignorant about the direction, he should follow the one who is more aware amongst them of the direction of the qiblah.1 For the one who was uninformed about the direction f the qiblah, must ask someone if he can, or else he should make ijtihad (make a judgment based on the best of his ability with the information available) if he is able to, otherwise he must follow someone who is reliable. If he cannot find one, then he should do his best in obedience to Allah and complete his prayer, and his prayer is correct. This sometimes happens to a number of those who travel to the lands of disbelievers and find no Muslim around them to inform them of the correct direction of qiblah. If one was capable of finding out the direction of the qiblah, but was neglectful and prayed without making all possible efforts, he should repeat his prayer because he was careless.2 1 Al-Mughni, 1/473. 2Al-Mughni, 1/490</answer>

    <title>Imam nullifies his ablution during prayer</title>
    <question>What happens if the Imam nullifies his ablution during the prayer? Or what if he suddenly recalls that he in fact was not in a state of wudu in the first place? What should he do? Is the prayer of the people praying behind him still valid or do they need to make up all or part of it?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If the Imam enters the state that nullifies his ablution or prayer, or remembers during the prayer that he did not perform ablution, then he should come out from prayer and appoint someone from the attendees who can lead them to completion. This has been narrated from Umar, Ali, Alqamah and Ataa. If he did not appoint anyone and the people prayed individually, this would be acceptable, and this is the opinion taken by Imam Al-Shafii. If he elected someone and advanced him to lead them, that is also permitted. The evidence for this is what has been narrated regarding Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) when he was stabbed. He took Abdur Rahman bin Auf who led the prayer to completion.1 And the reason for this deduction is that Umar did so in the presence of a number of Companions and others and no one opposed this act, so it became a consensus (ijma).2 If the Imam remembers that he is not in a state of purity, he should indicate to the followers to remain as they are and purify himself and come back to lead them. The evidence for this is the following narration of Abu Dawud from Abu Bakrah: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) entered into the Fajr prayer and indicated to the people that they should stay in their places. Then he came back to lead them and water was dripping from his head. (Sunan Abi Dawud, No. 233; Sahih Sunan Abi Dawud, 1/45) Commenting on this hadith, Imam Al-Khatabi says: In this hadith there is an evidence that if one is leading the people in prayer while in a state of impurity and the people do no know of it, then their prayer is unaffected and there is no need for them to repeat it. But the Imam has to repeat his prayer.3 If one is praying (either as Imam or follower or individually) and recalls that he had wiped over his socks during wudu while the duration of wiping had expired, he should terminate his prayer because his ablution is incorrect. This is what has been quoted from Imams Ahmad and Al-Shafii.4 Sahih Al-Bukhari/Fath Al-Bari, 7/60. 2 Ahkam Al-Imamah by Al-Muneef, 234, 1st Edition. 3 Maalim As-Sunan by Al-Khatabi (Collected by Al-Daas) 1/159. 4 Al-Mughni, 2/505.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If a person dozes while listening to the Friday sermon, it is recommended for him to change the place with the person next to him. In doing this he should be careful not to speak; rather, he should use some gestures (hand movements, etc.). The evidence for this is the hadith narrated by Samrah who said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If one of you dozes during the Friday sermon, he should exchange his position with the person sitting next to him. (Al-Baihaqi, 3/238; Sahih Al-Jami No. 812) Another hadith has been narrated by Ibn Umar who said: The Prophet said: If one of you dozes in the mosque on Friday, he should move his position to another place.

    <title>Asking for the return of a sadaqa</title>
    <question>We have collected some money to buy or build a Masjid and a School for Muslim children. Almost, everyone in the community donated some money. Before collecting the donations we were considering a certain piece of land; but the deal failed through. Some of the people who donated money requested the money back. There excuse was that they are donating the money for that certain piece of land only, but no one in the community leaders said they are collecting the money to buy this certain piece of land.
our questions:Can we give them the money back?
If we can give them the money back, is the money lawful for them to use as they please?
If they decide to donate the money once we find the right property for the masjid and the school, can we accept their money?
There are Muslims who have stores that sell liquor and pork; can we ask these people for donations?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.1 &amp; 2. If a donor's intention when he donated the money was for the purchase of the particular land in question, you became his trustee and representative with this money. If the efforts to buy this land have stopped or been cancelled, and the donor requests the return of the amount donated, then he has the right to have the money returned to him. However, since this money has been donated for the sake of Allah and is a sadaqa, they cannot spend it for personal use. You need to advise them that it then becomes their responsibility to spend it for a similar charitable purpose. However, if the intention at the time of donation was for the purpose of the project and not for the particular land in question, then you are not obliged to return them the money, and you should try to spend it in a timely manner for the project for which it was appropriated. 3. There is nothing against accepting donations from such people, whenever they are willing to donate, and I advise you to be vigilant not to allow any personal enmity to grow among the parties involved, since the donors are at the root muhsinoon (good-doers). 4. Yes, you can ask for donations from such people, on the condition that it is not understood that you agree with the forbidden (haram) actions which they are practicing. Additionally, it is incumbent upon you to advise and caution them that they must give up selling such items which are haram.</answer>

    <title>A woman whos period lasts longer than 15 days</title>
    <question>What is the ruling if a womans period lasts longer than 15 days?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If blood continues to flow and a woman is still waiting to purify herself, and it exceeds 15 days, then she should fall back to her normal period as a reference. Accordingly, she must make ghusl, and start praying, and in addition make up the prayers for the days which she did not pray since the time when her normal period would have ended. For example, suppose a woman has a normal period of 6 days. However, during a given month blood continued to flow until 15 days had passed, while she is still waiting for the end of the period. In this case she makes ghusl immediately, and starts praying, and prays all the prayers for the 9 days counted from the end of her normal period until she made ghusl. The reason for this is that the longest that a woman's menstrual cycle can be is 15 days according to madhab Imam Ahmed and many scholars (al-Mughni 1:388). Thus, if the flow continues past 15 days, then everything after the number of days in a normal cycle is considered istihada (which is blood that flows from a woman due to reasons other than menstruation, such as from a burst vein, hemorrhage, etc.) Regarding making up the missed prayers, she should pray them consecutively in order by intention, in one session, and she can rest if she gets tired.</answer>

    <title>Woman&amp;#146;s right to refuse marriage to someone</title>
    <question>I have a question for my friend. She is 17 years old and they just moved here from their home country and her guardians and mom want her to marry her cousin who lived in their same house back home but this girl really refuses to marry him because she dislikes for some reason and she is begging and crying in front of her mother not to make her marry him. This girl is saying she will not be happy with him My question is does any girl have the RIGHT to say no for her marriage if she does not like the man? This girl is Islamic and going to school and she doesn't know anybody to talk to but she really doesnt want to marry him and her mother is utterly pressuring her by telling her she will die and she will be destroyed if she doesnt marry this guy and her mother is telling her that nobody will marry her because she is not beautiful and rich.
Sorry it was long question but please reply me as soon as possible.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah). This situation about which this sister is asking is a common one and occurs often as a result of a clash of desires between parents and their daughter. It could be for a benefit or interest the mother or father sees and the young woman doesnt, and each regards the issue from a different perspective or with a particular consideration. And perhaps the opinion of the parents is the appropriate and correct one as a result of their prior trials and longer experience in life, and perhaps the woman sometimes looks to the appearance of the groom more than anything else, whereas the parents may look to other considerations, such as his family status, or his long-term career or employment. Of course none of this means that the womans opinion isnt sometimes more correct and preferable, particularly when the opinion of the parents stems from a benefit they may realize if the marriage is accomplished, and they do not actually make the priority their daughter who is the most important thing in this issue. And while being vigilant in advising you of the importance of obeying ones parents and struggling with oneself to realize their wishes and desires and giving their opinion the priority, the point must clearly be made that the following two hadeeth from the Prophet (peace be upon him) must be abided by and carried out, as within them are the complete answer to your question and questions from others in similar situations: The first hadeeth: If he whose character and deen (practice of religion) pleases you, approaches you in marriage, then marry him, for if you dont, their will be fitna in the land and vast corruption. (Tirmidhi and others, see Sunan Tirmidhi #1085 and it is hassan (reliable) as per Sahih ul-Jaami #270). (fitna here can be understood to refer to the temptation for fornication, enmity and the cutting off of relations among the people and relatives, and the spreading of hatred) The second: Buraida (may Allah be pleased with him) said that a young woman came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, My father married me to his brothers son (i.e. her cousin) in order to raise his standing among the people, so the Prophet (peace be upon him) put the matter in her hands (i.e. asserted that the validity of the marriage is conditioned on her approval and negated by her refusal). So she said, I authorize and endorse what he has done but I wanted women to know that fathers cannot force their will in these matters. And it was narrated by NisaaI via Abdullah ibn Buraida via Aaisha that a young woman came to her and said, My father married me to his brothers son in order to raise his standing among the people and I am unwilling (to agree to it), so she said, Sit until the Prophet (peace be upon him) comes. So the Prophet (peace be upon him) came and she informed him of the situation, so he sent for her father and invited him (over) and asserted that the matter is in the brides hands. So she said, Oh Prophet of Allah I have authorized and endorsed what my father has done, but I wanted to know if women had a say in the matter or not. (Sunan al-NisaaI, Kitaab al-Nikaah min Sunanihi and it is sahih). I ask Allah for you success and guidance to that in which there is blessings for you and your family, and may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad .</answer>

Praise be to Allah.Man-woman relationship before marriage Before responding to this question, a comment must be made regarding an objectionable and reprehensible issue implied in the question, and that is the mentioning by the sister that he falls in love with another woman. It is known that it is not permissible in the Islamic religion to establish a relationship between a man and a woman who is ajanabiyya to him (lit. foreign, i.e., marriageable) before marriage, for Allah revealed in Surat al-Maidah (the Table), ayah 5 a verse whose meaning can be translated as: This day are (all) things good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste and virtuous women who are believers, but chaste women among People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues. If anyone rejects faith, fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (all spiritual good). And the word akhdan that appears in this ayah (appearing above as secret intrigues) means intimate friend or companion, and in this case refers to a lover , and Allah has indicated in Surat al-Ahzab (33:53) that a condition for talking with women when it is needed is: (a translation of the meaning) and if you ask them (women) for something you want, ask them from behind a hijab (both in the sense of a physical barrier such as a screen or wall, as well as in clothing); that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs And Allah has commanded women not to speak with soft, sensual voices with a man who is ajnabi (lit. foreign, meaning one to whom marriage is not forbidden) so that he is not tempted by their voices, and so as not to provoke feelings of lust. Allah ta'ala said in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 32, a verse whose meaning can be translated as:  if you do fear (Allah) be not too complacent of speech lest one in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire; but utter sufficient and appropriate speech. (33:32) So how could it possibly be permissible after all of these injunctions to establish love or friendship relations among women and men who are ajanib (marriageable)? Conditions to marry a second wife in Islam And as for the original matter of the question, Allah (subhanahu wa-taala), Who is al-Hakim (All Wise) al-Khabir (All Experienced), and Who is more knowledgeable about the human beings He created than they themselves are about themselves, has ordained that a man is allowed to marry whom he wills among women as long as he does not bond in marriage under his care and responsibility more than four women . And this is conditioned upon him dealing justly among them the known justice specified by Shariah which includes overnight stays and spending. If he does not have the ability and capacity to deal with such justice , then he should suffice with one, as Allah indicates in Surat al-Nisa in ayah 3, which has a meaning that can be translated as:  marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if you fear that you will not be able to deal justly (with them) then only one (4:3) And Allahs Shariah (law) is all just and wise, and He ordains what He wills and does what He wants and it is incumbent upon as human beings to believe and have faith and submit and obey and abide by the Shari`ah, otherwise then we are not Muslims nor muminin (believers). As Allah also said in Surat al-Nisa, ayah 65, a verse whose meaning can be translated as: But no, by your Lord, they can have no (real) faith until they make you judge in all disputes between them, and find in their souls no resistance against your decisions, but accept them with the fullest conviction (4:65) and in Surat al-Ahzab, ayah 36, a meaning that can be translated as: It is not fitting for a mumin (believing man) or muminah (believing woman) when a matter has been decided by Allah and His Messenger to have any option about their decision: if anyone disobeys Allah and His Apostle he is indeed strayed on a manifestly wrong path. (33:36) Second marriage in Islam: Do you need permission from your first wife? Furthermore, no evidence appears either in the Quran or sunnah requiring the permission of the first wife if her husband wishes to marry another wife, and therefore he is not required to ask her permission. However, he needs to be judicious in taking this decision and to weigh it carefully with respect to benefits and drawbacks and to look with the eye of wisdom at all of the considerations pertaining to the matter, and he should strive all he can to conciliate, reassure, and satisfy his first wife, in order to ease and mitigate the effect of the matter upon her.</answer>

    <title>Minimum amount (nisaab) required to pay zakat in dollars</title>
    <question>I live in the united states. How much is Nesab el-Zakat in US
  dollars?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Nisaab ul-Zakat for naqd (gold and silver) is defined as the minimum amount of naqd specified by sharia below which one is not required to pay zakat, whereas if ones wealth exceeds it then zakat becomes incumbent. And it is known that zakat ul-maal (wealth) in sharia is required for the two types of naqdgold and silverand what serves their function in modern times (commonly referred to as cash), whether it is dollars or riyals or pounds or otherwise. Nisaab for gold as our Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed us (and for currencies made from gold) is 20 mithqaalan, a measure which is equivalent to 85 grams of pure gold (1 mithqaal = 4.25 grams). It becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%. Nisaab for silver and currencies made from silver is 200 dirhams, which is equivalent to 595 grams of pure silver (1 dirham = 2.975 grams). Likewise, it becomes incumbent upon anyone who owns such an amount in any form to pay zakat on it in the amount of 2.5%. It is well known that there is a noticeable disparity between the value of nisaab for gold and that of silver in our times. The best and most conservative for a poor person is to assess how many dollars he has that have been in his possession for a complete lunar year (Hijri, which is 354 days). If the amount reaches the value of nisaab for silver or more, then he should pay from it for every 1000 dollars, 25 dollars (i.e., 2.5%) to be spent in the prescribed benficiaries as specified by shariah, and we ask Allah to aid us and help us succeed in haqq il-maal wa salla allahu ala nabiyyana muhammad</answer>

    <title>What to do with income partly haram and partly halal</title>
    <question>My friend is asking againHe was working in a restaurant, serving everything except wine (khamr)but the meat there is not halal and he knows that; he was carrying the empty glasses of wine and washing them, he knows that that is not allowed. His Q is: he felt guilty so he left the restaurant. He had money out of that job and he wants to start a new halal business.
CAN HE USE THAT MONEY TO START A NEW JOB? IF HIS MONEY IS NOT HALAL, DOES HE NEED TO GET RID OF THAT MONEY OR CAN HE WORK WITH IT AND FROM THE PROFIT HE CAN TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY?
WAJAZAKUM ALLAH KHAYRAYAMAN</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The job which this brother was performing is the kind in which halal and haram have been mixed together. At the same time that he was serving food that contained haram ingredients such as pork or lahm ul-maita (meat not properly slaughtered), he was serving things that are halal as well washing dishes and glasses. If he had known at the time he was working about the prohibition of the haram things, then his income in this situation comprises mixed money, both halal and haram. So if he wants to repent to Allah, then he needs to get rid of the portion of his income which his haram, by estimating and approximating to his best judgment how much the haram portion of the income was which was earned via haram service. He can spend it in any of the various charitable means, and he cannot benefit from it whether by investment or otherwise. As for the remaining portion which is the halal amount, he is allowed to use it to his benefit.</answer>

    <title>Permissibility of eating food cooked by kaafir (unbeliever)</title>
    <question>Can Muslims eat in restaurants owned and directed by people who are not worshipping Allah? For example, Chinese restaurants. Keeping in mind that the type of food in these places is not HARAM in itself but the people making this food are KOFFAR.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah). There is no objection for a Muslim to eat from food that a kaafir (unbeliever), whether polytheist or otherwise, has cooked, as the issue of cooking does not involve slaughtering according to Islamic guidelines so that we would require the person to be from ahl il-kitaab (People of the Book) among the kuffar. In fact, it is only a matter of cooking, so the only issues that concern us are cleanliness and the avoidance of najasa (impurity), and likewise that nothing haram (forbidden) is mixed with the food such as khamr (wine or alcoholic beverages) or lard. May Allah protect us from harm, evil and the things he has forbidden (al-muharramaat).</answer>

    <title>Ruling on Congregational Prayer in the Mosque</title>
    <question>Dear brother in faith.
I start with the name of Allah. I would like to thank you for your prompt response for our previous question which was of a great help to our community (All thanks be to Allah).
What is the Islamic point-of-view regarding those who attend Friday prayers in the Masjid and fail to attend any other of the daily prayers? Do you have to attend the prayers at the Masjid if time permits?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praise is due to Allaah A- Evidence From The Qur'an First Evidence Our Lord tabaraka wa ta'aala said what may be translated as {And when you [i.e., the commander of an army] are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you and let them carry their arms. And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you} (Quran 4:102) I say: In the verse is an order to establish salat, and the order was repeated once more, &quot;and let the other party ...&quot; There is evidence here that jama'ah meaning congregational prayer is obligatory on all because the obligation did not fall from being upon the second party simply by the congregation of the first party. Allah has commanded a congregational prayer while they are in a state of war and fear, and if it were only a sunnah then it would have been better to abandon the congregational prayer; however, since Allah has ordered it, and obligations like following the Imam are allowed to be violated in order for the second party to pray behind the Imam. This proves clearly that the congregational prayer is obligatory. This is a clear proof, and there is none amongst Muslims (scholars) that denies the salat of fear ordered in this verse. Second Evidence Our Lord the Exalted has said what may be translated as &quot;The day that a Shin shall be laid bare, and they shall be summoned to prostrate, but they shall not be able to. Their eyes will be cast down, ignominy will cover them, seeing that they had been summoned aforetime to bow in adoration while they were whole, and had refused.&quot; (Quran 68:42-43) The evidence here is from several facets amongst them: Allah punished them because they did not answer the call to prostrate. The one that is calling to salat is the one calling Athan. As has been explained by the hadeeth of Ibn Abi Maktoom: the Prophet told him &quot;do you hear Hayya Alassalat, Hayya Alalfalah (parts of the call to prayer)&quot;? He said yes, then the Prophet said &quot;fahayhala&quot; which means something like &quot;then go answer the call.&quot; This hadeeth is sahih (which means sound, and authentic) and is narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad. So he learned that the one who does not answer the call, has not answered. Third Evidence Allah ta'aala said what might be translated as &quot;Establish salat and pay your zakat and bow with those that are bowing&quot;. (Quran 2:43) The proof therein is: That Allah ordered us to bow, and meaning salat because it is a pillar of the salat. His statement which was translated as &quot;with those that are bowing&quot; is an order to bow with those that are bowing, and that is not accomplished except through congregation. So this is evidence that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because the meaning of the verse is not accomplished except through congregation. B- Evidence From The Sunnah First Evidence Abu Huraira narrated that the Messenger of Allah said &quot;The heaviest salat for the hypocrite is that of Isha'a and Fajr and if they knew what was in them they would have attended them even if it meant crawling, and I have a strong desire to order the salat to be established, then order a man to lead the people in salat then I would go with some men carrying bundles of wood to a people not attending the salat and burn their houses on them.&quot; Agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim, and this was Muslim's version. This hadeeth proves that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory because one's house would not be burned for leaving a sunnah. Those of the opinion that salat al-jama'ah is not obligatory find refuge in a few excuses with regards to this hadeeth which follow: They said this punishment is in reference to those that do not attend the Jum'ah (Friday) prayer, and their evidence in this regard is the hadeeth of Abdullah Bin Mas'ood narrated by Muslim that the Prophet said to a people that miss the Friday prayer &quot;I have a strong desire to order a person to lead the salat and I would burn the homes of those that have missed the Friday prayer&quot;. This is not in contradiction to the hadeeth of Abu Huraira because Ibn Mas'ood is stating that the burning is for those that miss the Friday prayer, and Abu Huraira is stating that the burning is for those that miss salat al-jama'ah and there is no contradiction between the two because the hadeeth of Abu Huraira clearly states the Isha'a and Fajr and it is likely that what is meant is to show that both cases are worthy of the burning. They say: This has been abrogated! My reply is: Where is the proof that this has been abrogated, and who has narrated it? However, to simply claim abrogation without evidence is a forgery upon Allah which is not backed by any knowledge. They say: The Prophet wanted to burn their houses because they were hypocrites, not because they did not attend the prayer in congregation. The best rebuttal of this statement was given by Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him in his statement, ...as for your claim that he wanted to punish them because of their hypocrisy, and not for missing the congregation this implies two errors: The first: cancelling what the Messenger confirmed and related to missing the congregation. The second: Confirming what the Messenger cancelled. For he never punished the hypocrites for their hypocrisy; to the contrary, he used to accept from them what they announced, and left what they concealed between them and Allah. As such the hadeeth of Abu Huraira remains a strong argument for the obligation of salat al jama'ah. Second Evidence What Muslim narrated in his Sahih that a blind man said, &quot;Oh Messenger of Allah, I do not have someone to guide me to the Mosque,&quot; and thus asked the Messenger to grant him special permission not to attend congregational prayers. As he was leaving, the Messenger called him and said &quot;Do you hear the call? &quot;, he said &quot;yes&quot;. He said, &quot;Then answer.&quot; Authentic versions narrated by Ahmed and others came as: narrated by Ibn Maktoom that he said: &quot;Oh Messenger of Allah, I am blind, live far away, and have a guide that does not suit me, so can't you give me consent to pray at home?&quot; He said &quot;Do you hear the call?&quot; Ibn Maktoom replied &quot;Yes&quot;. The Prophet then said &quot;I cannot find an excuse for you&quot;. If the blind man has no excuse not to pray in congregation, how can there be an excuse for the one that can see? Those that conclude salat al-jama'ah to be sunnah say, &quot;This is an order to pray in congregation that implies the preference not the obligation of salat al-jama'ah&quot;. The response to this is that since the order here was unrestricted one needs supportive evidence to conclude that it was only meant to show preference. Now how about supportive evidence confirming salat al-jama'ah to be obligatory. If supportive evidence were not necessary to conclude that an order was stated to imply preference then each and every order could be understood to have been implying preference, and nothing would remain obligatory. Third Evidence Narrated by Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them (him, and his father), that the Prophet said, &quot;Whosover hears the call to salat, and does not respond, then there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse.&quot; This is a sound, and authentic hadeeth. Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote in his Risalat Assalat &quot;... and mind you this chain (referring to chain of narration of the above hadeeth) is authentic.&quot; This hadeeth has been narrated by Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah, Daar qutni, Al-Hakim, Al-Baghawi, Bayhaqi, and has also been traced and judged authentic by the following scholars: Al-Thahabi, Al-Nawawi, Ibn Hajar Al Asqalani, Ibn Taimiya, Ibn Qayyim Al, and Al-Albani. Some have spoken about this hadeeth, claiming that its chain is stopped (literal translation for the Arabic word mawqoof; however, the authentic chains of narrations which have been traced to the Prophet contradict their claim. That hadeeth states that whoever does not answer the call, there is no salat for him, and this judgment would not be passed to someone who is simply going against an order which implies preference, and not obligation. Fourth Evidence Abdullah Bin Mas'ood said: who ever would be pleased to meet Allah as a Muslim, then let him take care of those salat which are called to because they are of the ways of huda (guidance), and Allah has given to your Prophet the ways of huda. And if you were to establish salat in your homes, like that person staying behind in his home, you would be abandoning the sunnah of your Prophet, and if you were to abandon the sunnah of your prophet you would surely go astray. And there is not a man amongst you that purifies himself (yatatahhar), and does so properly, then directs himself to one of these mosques except that Allah will write for him with each step he takes a hasanah (merit), and raises him a grade, and drops from him a sayyi'ah (demerit). And I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind from prayer in congregation except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy is known. And one that could not come on his own would be carried between two men until he is stood in the row. In another narration he said, &quot;the Messenger of Allah taught us the ways of huda, and amongst the ways of huda is salat in the Mosque in which Athan is called&quot;. Narrated by Muslim. The evidence in this hadeeth is that not praying in congregation is considered a sign of confirmed hypocrisy. It is known that the signs of hypocrisy are those of abandoning something which is obligatory, or doing something which is haram (unlawful.) And there is not a Muslim in whose heart iman (faith) has established itself, that would want to be like the hypocrites in their attributes. Fifth Evidence Ibu Sa'eed Al-Khudry said that the Messenger of Allah said, &quot;If there are three let one of them be their Imam, and the one with the strongest right to be Imam is the one that is the best reciter of the Quran (both in terms of the amount memorized, and ability to recite it properly)&quot;. Abu Ad-Darda'a said that the Messenger of Allah said &quot;There are not three in a town where no Athan is called, and congregational prayers are not established amongst them except that the Sheitan will overcome them, so you must stick to jama'ah because the wolf gets the stray one&quot;. Authentic hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmed. Sixth Evidence Abu Asha'a'thaa'a Al-Muharibi said: We were sitting in the masjid (mosque) then the Mu'athin (the one that makes the call to prayer) made the call to prayer. Then a man got up from the masjid walking. Abu Huraira followed him with his sight until he left the Masjid. Then Abu Huraira said &quot;as for this person he has disobeyed Abal Qasim (the Messenger) &quot;. Narrated by Muslim. Abu Huraira, may Allah be pleased with him, judged this man as having disobeyed Abal Qasim , and Abu Huraira would not have passed this verdict without knowledge of the sunnah of Abal Qasim . And whosoever is considered among the disobedient then he has left something which is obligatory. These, my Muslim brothers are some of the pieces of evidence that oblige the Muslim servant to pray in congregation, and whoever ponders in the Quran and Sunnah will find more and more. Each piece of the preceding evidence is enough in itself to be proof that salat al-jama'ah is obligatory. We also remind our brothers that the Muslim servant is not allowed to reject anything from Allah or his Messenger just because a certain scholar ruled differently. Evidence is an argument against all people. Imam's that have concluded differently are expected to have a valid excuse because even they cannot contradict clear evidence from Quran and Sunnah. Their teachings that people must follow Quran and Sunnah are well known, and they, may Allah have mercy upon them, did not become Imam's except by strong adherence to Quran and Sunnah. Know this because it is beneficial to you... Of Allah's bounty upon us with regards to this issue is that the best of people, the companions of the Messenger , have had Ijma'a (consensus) in it. There are no narrations passed down from any one of them giving leave not to pray in congregation. And following is what has been confirmed by them: Ibn Mas'ood said, &quot;and I have seen us, where not one of us would stay behind except for a hypocrite whose hypocrisy was known.&quot; (5th evidence) Ibn Mas'ood, Abu Musa Al-Ash'ary, Ali, Abu Huraira, Ayesha, and Ibn Abbas have stated, &quot;Whoever hears the call to salat and does not answer, there is no salat for him unless he has a valid excuse.&quot; (3rd evidence) Ibn Al-Qayyim said after he presented the statements of the companions: &quot;These are statements of the companions as you find them, authentic and well known, and there is not one known statement from any of the companions which contradicts this. Each of these pieces of evidence is enough all by itself, so how about when they all enforce one another. Verily in Allah is our success.&quot; These are the statements of the people of knowledge: Al-Baghawi wrote in Sharh Assunnah (3/349), &quot;More than one of the companions were of the opinion that whoever hears the call and does not answer, then there is no salat for him.&quot; Ata'a bin Rabah said, &quot;There is no excuse for anyone created by Allah in a city or country side not to attend if he hears the call to prayer.&quot; Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, &quot;If his mother forbids him from praying Isha'a in congregation, out of pity, he should not obey her. Al-Awza'i said: &quot;There is no obedience to the father in leaving the Friday prayer, or the daily congregational prayers, regardless of whether one heard the call to prayer or not.&quot; Amongst those that have said that it is obligatory as well are Ibn Khuzaima, Al-Shafi'i, Al-Bukhari, Ibn Hibban, Dawood, Ahl Al-Dhahir, Hanabila, Ishaaq, and most of Ahl Al-Hadeeth, and some of the companions of Al-Shafi'i. You now know, may Allah have mercy upon you, the preceding evidence concerning the obligatory status of salat al-jama'ah,and the statements of those that conclude it as such from amongst the pious predecessors of our Ummah (nation.) Now what remains for you to know is that whoever prays alone, then his prayer is correct; however, he has the ithm (sin) of leaving the jama'ah (congregation). As for the acceptance, or rejection, this is up to The Creator, and no one can say that the prayer of Zaid is accepted while the prayer of Obaid is not. We ask Allaah to help us in remembering and thanking him and better worshipping him. Allaah the exalted knows best.</answer>

    <title>Interruption of tawaaf or sa'I</title>
    <question>Is it permissible to interrupt tawaaf or sa'i?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If a person is performing tawaaf (circumabulation around the Ka'bah) or sa'i (between Safa and Marwah), and he comes across a need (e.g., he is thirsty and wants to drink something, or loses someone from his family members and stops to look for him, or becomes tired and wants to take some rest), and if the break was short, then he may continue his tawaaf from where he left off. If the prayer is called and he interrupts his tawaaf to pray, the scholars have disagreed on this issue. The most conservative opinion is that when he continues his tawaaf, he should not count the last round which he left incomplete.1 The issue of taking a rest in tawaaf and sa'i, however, is based on the condition that tawaaf and sa'i should be completed contiguously. In sa'i, continuity is not a requirement according to the best opinion.2 So, if a person is performing sa'i, and he breaks after some of the rounds, and then comes back to complete them, this would be considered permissible. However, regarding continuity of tawaaf, the scholars have two opinions: That continuity is waajib (mandatory), and that a long discontinuity without due justification nullifies the tawaaf. That continuity is a sunnah, and the tawaaf is not nullified even though the break was long.3 However, it is better to act according to the first opinion. 1 Fataawa Al-Hajj Wal 'Umrah by Ibn Baz, p. 80; Al Majmu' by Al-Nawawi, 8/49. 2 Al-Mughni, 3/414. 3 Al-Majmu' by Al-Nawawi, 8/47</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If a person is ordered to perform a certain assignment at his work, he should consider itif the act does not involve any disobedience to Allah (subhaanahu WA ta'aala) he should execute it. Otherwise, if it does involve some disobedience to Allah (subhaanahu WA ta'aala), he should not obey the command, or else he will be a partner in sin and wrong-doing. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &quot;A human must not be obeyed if that (i.e., obeying the human) causes disobedience to Allah (subhaanahu wa ta'aala). Indeed, obedience is only in righteous deeds&quot; (Sahih Al-Bukhari with Fath Al-Bari, 13/121; Ahmad, 1/91; and the context is found in Al-Silsilah As-Sahihah, No. 181) And Allah (subhaanahu wa ta'aala) said (about the people who went astray) in the Qur'an (an interpretation of the meaning): &quot;They will say: Our Lord! We followed in the footsteps of our leaders and elders and they misguided us from the right path&quot;.</answer>

    <title>Minimum distance to allow shortening prayer</title>
    <question>What is the distance which, once one has set out for it, allows one to shorten the prayer?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars (al-jumhoor) comprising the Maliki's and the Shafiei's and the Hanbali's have taken the opinion that the recognized distance for one who has undertaken its travel in shortening the prayer is four burud (an antiquated unit of distance), which is two average day's travel by heavily-loaded camels (equivalent to 88.7 km in distance). Among what they have quoted as evidence is what was authentically (sahih) narrated by Ibn Omar and Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that they used to shorten the prayers and break fasting at a distance of four BURUD. This quoted distance is approximate and not exactly limited as per the majority of scholars, and thus what is slightly less is exempted as well. Some scholars including ibn Qadama and Sheikh ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyya and his pupil Ibn ul-Qayyim have taken the opinion that all that is referred to as travel in practice and in language, and requires preparation of provisions as well as rest and similar things, falls under the licenses of shari'a such as the shortening of the prayer and breaking the fast of Ramadan. Their pretext and justification is the generalization in the wording referring to the shortening of the prayer as it appears in the Qur'an and sunnah, as in the example of surat al-Nisaa', verses 4:101-102: &quot;When you travel through the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you: for the unbelievers are unto you open enemies. When you (O Messenger) are with them, and stand to lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear. And let the other party come up - which has not yet prayed - and let them pray with you, taking all precautions, and bearing arms: the Unbelievers wish, if you were careless of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the unbelievers Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment.&quot; And in the following hadith: Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 2960: Ya'la bin Umayyah said: I said to 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab &quot;Verily Allaah has said ' if you shorten your prayers, for fear the unbelievers may attack you' and now the people feel secure.&quot; 'Umar said, &quot;[Indeed] I wondered the same thing you are wondering, so I mentioned it to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and he said '[It is] a charity that Allaah has bestowed upon you so accept His charity.' &quot; (Abu 'Isa said this hadith is hasan sahih.) Al-Tirmidhi, hadith 453: Umayyah ibn Abdullah ibn Khaalid ibn Asid said to Ibn 'Umar, &quot;How can you shorten the prayer when Allaah the Almighty has said, 'there is no blame on you if you shorten your prayers, for fear' ,&quot; so Ibn 'Umar said, &quot;O son of my brother, verily the Prophet (peace be upon him) came to us when we were misguided, so he taught us, and among what he taught us was that Allaah the Almighty has ordered us to pray two raka'a during travel.&quot; (Al-Shu'aithiy said that al-Zuhriy used to relate this hadith via Abdullah ibn Abu Bakr.) The ayah expresses the permission for shortening the prayer for one who travels without specifically restricting the distance. Thus the Qur'an and sunnah mention &quot;travel&quot; and do not differentiate a particular travel from another, and as such if one travels via air for one hour without any burden or hardship it would be permissible for him or her to shorten the prayer and break the mandatory fast. In fact, this is the most viable opinion, unless for a particularly case there is confusion as to whether it is commonly regarded as travel or not, in which case one falls back to the opinion of the majority of scholars (al-jumhoor) (regarding the minimum required distance).</answer>

    <title>Returning after traveling a short distance and shortening the prayer</title>
    <question>If one commences travel and shortens the prayers, then it becomes evident that one must return, and one has only traveled a short distance, what is the ruling on his prayers?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.His prayers are valid since the precept to be followed is one's intention to complete the distance of travel and not actually completing the full distance. The required condition of shortening the prayer is that one resolves in the beginning of his travel to traverse a given distance, and if he both leaves and heads out with such intention then he is permitted to shorten the prayer.</answer>

    <title>Shortening the prayer when returning from cancelled travel plans</title>
    <question>If one who is traveling decides to return and alters his travel plan should he shorten his prayer on his way back?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If what remains from his return trip would commonly be known locally as &quot;travel,&quot; then there is no objection to his shortening the prayer. This opinion would be the ruling as per those who regard what is commonly accepted by custom and traditions in the local area as the basis for defining travel. As for the majority of scholars (al-jumhoor), they place the condition that the distance for the return in and of itself must meet the distance required to be considered travel (88.7 km plus or minus), even if he is returning to get something he forgot and plans to return to his original travel plans. This is because the return trip should be considered an independent travel in and of itself.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If one does not know and there is nothing to indicate whether or not the distance is far enough, then a traveler is not allowed to shorten the prayers.

    <question>When one leaves his/her home town traveling without a specific destination until reaching the distance limit for shortening the prayer (e.g. a shepherd looking for good grazing for his sheep, a picnicker searching for a more suitable place for camping, or one chasing a fugitive) is he/she allowed to shorten prayers?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.According to the majority (of Muslim scholars) one would not be allowed to shorten prayers, since the traveler in such a case has set off without the intention beforehand (and the intention is of significance in Islam). Therefore he/she has not met the condition of being a traveler.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If the people in question know beforehand that those whom they are following had the intention to travel, then they would be permitted to shorten. On the other hand, if they were fully unaware of the intentions of those whom they were following, they would be allowed to shorten prayers once they themselves set-off with the intention to travel apart from their companions.

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The majority of the Muslim scholars assert the condition that a traveler must depart from all the housings and buildings of his/her home town relying on the fact that Allaah (glory be to Him) relates shortening to travel (specifically darb fil-ardh), and such travel only happens once departing one's home-town. Moreover, the Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) himself shortened at a place called (Dhul-Hulaiyfah) after departing from al-Madinah.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If the airport, sea-port or railway station are within the outskirts of the traveler's home-town, or even linked to his/her home-town by contiguous dwellings or buildings, no license to shorten prayers is allowed, since he/she would not be considered to have departed the dwelling or town. Once the plane, ship, or train has traveled away from all housing and buildings, only then is he/she allowed to shorten and/or perform together two prayers. If the airport, harbor, or train station is outside the home town, a traveler is allowed to utilize the license to shorten and combine two prayers together based on the fact that he or she in this case has departed from his/her city and has already commenced on his/her journey.</answer>

    <title>Libaas ul-shuhrah and wearing extravagant clothing</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on libaas ul-shuhrah or the wearing of extravagant clothing?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All praise and thanks be to Allaah the Lord of the worlds. Regarding your question about the prohibition of so-called &quot;libaas ul-shuhrah&quot; (lit. dress of high repute, i.e. to show-off or as a status symbol), there is a sound and truthful hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that Allah's messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: &quot;He who wears libaas ul-shuhra in this world will be dressed in humiliating clothes on the day of judgment.&quot; (narrated by Ahmed &amp; Abu Dawood, confirmed sahih by Al Albani in Sahih Al-Jami' 6526) Those who wear libaas ul-shuhrah will be punished on the day of judgment in accordance with their deeds (as you sow, so you reap), provided that he/she meant sovereignty and supremacy upon mankind. In return, Allaah Almighty will humiliate him/her on the day of judgment and will suppress him/her to put-on such a dress for which people would despise him/her and mock at him/her (as you sow, so you reap). The question here is: &quot; What consists libaas ul-shurah?&quot; What is meant by this expression is a anything worn to show-off and to attract the attentions of others, so as to look upwards unto him/her once he/she appears wearing it. This, of course is due either to its strange colors amongst the ordinary dresses of other people or due to the stylish models or even to how precious, expensive or even to the contrary of this as being trivial and completely valueless. Hence, our righteous forefathers (may Allaah have mercy upon their souls) used to hate, disregard and even despise either extremity of the fame-clothing: i.e. those which are highly bombastic &amp; precious and/or vise versa alike. All we wish of His All-Mighty is to grant us the righteous clothing and save us in this world and in the hereafter. Aameen.</answer>

    <title>Repenting but Repeatedly Sinning</title>
    <question>I fall into sin and then repent. But my base self overcomes me and I fall into it again. Does this nullify my earlier repentance leaving the previous sins intact and not forgiven?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.In the opinion of the majority of scholars it is not a condition for a repentance to be accepted that the penitent does not fall into the same sin again. It is a condition that the sin be given up immediately and that there should be true feelings of regret in the heart. This should be accompanied by the firm intention not to fall into it again. Now, with these conditions met, if he falls into it again, then this will be considered a new sin altogether, requiring a new repentance and with no connection to those of the past.

    <title>Repentance for Neglecting Acts of Worship</title>
    <question>I have neglected many rights of Allah in the past, such as prayers, fasts, and zakah (paying poor-due). Am I required to repeat them or to compensate for them?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.As far as the five daily prayers are concerned, the preferred opinion is that the repetition or compensation (or what is known as qadha in Arabic), is not obligatory for the reason that prayers are obligatory at a particular time, and once that time has elapsed, there is no way to offer them. However, one should seek Allah's forgiveness and offer as many nawafil (voluntary prayers) as possible. As for fasting-yes; if a person was a Muslim at the time they became obligatory and he did not fast, then their performance is required, accompanied by the feeding of a poor Muslim for every day of fastng that was not observed during previous years. What is required is always a day for a day-no more, no less. Example 1: A person did not fast three days of Ramadan in the year 1400 A.H., and five days of Ramadan in the year 1401 A.H., all out of negligence. He must now fast eight days, and feed eight poor Muslims in compensation. Example 2: A girl reached puberty in Ramadan of the year 1400 A.H. but out of shame and modesty did not inform anyone of her menstruation, and, rather, continued fasting say for eight days of her period. Thereafter, she repented. She would then be required to redo eight days of fasting. It may also be pointed out here that this is the predominant position. A minority opinion is that the ruling for fasting is the same as that for the prayers, i.e., there is no qadha (making up) for fasting in the case of a person who did not fast and did not have a valid reason for not fasting. As for he who did not offer the obligatory zakah, it is necessary for the repentant to pay it for all previous unpaid years, for it is, from one angle, Allah's right, while from another, the poor people's right.

    <title>Repentance from One Type of Sin While Committing Another</title>
    <question>Is repentance from a particular sin acceptable while I am a victim of another?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Yes, repentance from a particular sin is acceptable even if the repentant insists on another sin which is of a different nature and not the same as the one from which he has repented. For example, if a man repents from having accepted interest but not from drinking wine, his repentance over accepting interest is acceptable, and vice versa. But if he repents from simple interest but not compound interest then his repentance is invalid. Or if he repents from taking drugs but insists on drinking wine, or vice versa, then the repentance is invalid too. It will also be incorrect and unacceptable if a man repents from adultery with one woman but commits it with another. In all of these cases they have only shifted from one variety of sin to another within the same kind. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Returning stolen money when owner not reachable</title>
    <question>I stole from certain people. Now I have repented, but I do not know where they live. Perhaps another may say,&quot; I embezzled some money from a firm which has closed up its business.&quot; Or yet another person may say,&quot; I pilfered some material from an establishment which has shifted its premises.&quot; What shall I do now?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.In all these cases it is incumbent upon you to search for them to the extent of your means. If you find them, return them their right. If the owner or owners have died, then their right should be returned to their immediate kin. However, if you cannot locate them, then spend in charity equal amounts on their behalf. Allah will give them the reward of this charity. And if they are unbelievers, Allah will compensate them in some way or other in this world itself, since there are no rewards for the unbelievers in the Hereafter. This is similar to the story that Ibn ul-Qayyim has written in his Madarij Al-Salikin (1/388). He states that a soldier of a Muslim regiment ghalla [i.e., stole from al-ghaneema (the war spoils)]. Then, after some time, he repented and took with him what he had stolen and reported to the commander of the regiment. But the commander refused to accept it back saying, 'And how do I return this to the soldiers [seeing that they have dispersed].' The man then went to a scholar - Hajjaj bin al-Sha'ir [seeking his advice]. He [Hajjaj] told him: 'Listen! Allah knows the army involved and each soldier's name and lineage. Send one fifth of the amount to the one whose right is one-fifth (this is in reference to bait ul-maal, or the central depository in the Islamic government which contains money to be spent in charity, and which receives one-fifth of all spoils of war), and spend the rest in charity in their name and Allah will give convey it to them.' The man did so. And when the news reached Mu'awiyya bin Sufyan [who was then the khalifa], he said: 'That I had been the man who gave that ruling, is dearer to me than half of what I rule over.' Imam Ibn Taymiyya has also given a similar ruling. (See Madarij)</answer>

    <title>Repentance From Backbiting and Informing Victim</title>
    <question>I have committed backbiting involving a person or a group of people, or have unjustly slandered some people regarding things with which they didn't have anything to do. Is it a condition of repentance that I should inform them and seek their pardon? And if this is not required then how do I repent?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The answer will depend on the nature of the interests of the people involved. If the case is such that if he were to inform them of what he had once said about them, it would not be likely to increase their anger, then, he should do that and seek their forgiveness. He may then tell them - in general terms, and without offering details - that he had wronged them in the past by expressing such sentiments about them that were not right and just, and that now he has repented and seeks their forgiveness. But if the case is the opposite, that is, the fear is that if he told them of the previous backbiting or slander, they will - and in most cases that is most likely to happen - be angry with him, or will not be satisfied with the general terms, rather, will demand to know all the details, which is sure to provoke them to anger, then, in such a case, it is not obligatory on him to let them know and seek their forgiveness for the sharee'ah (Islamic law) does not order adding insult to injury. And informing a person who was in a happy mood, of things that will evoke feelings of distress or anger, is something against the purpose of the sharee'ah, which enjoins the spread of happiness and brotherliness. In fact, sometimes such action may give place to animosity where there was love. In such situations it is enough to repent in the following manner. Evoke in oneself the feeling of regret, and seek forgiveness from Allah accompanied by the conviction that it was an abominable and unlawful thing in which he had indulged. Try and make up for what he had said earlier before others by denying the presence of things and qualities he had alleged were in them and clear the person or persons involved. Follow up by mentioning and asserting good qualities of those he had spoken ill of in the presence of the same people in whose company he had slandered them. Defend the people he had slandered when they are slandered in his presence. Pray to Allah in private to forgive the sins and shortcomings of those he had wronged. (See Madarij Al-Salikin, and Al-Mughni with explanatory notes for further elucidation). You must note, dear brother Muslim or sister Muslimah, that there is a difference between the material rights of the people and non-material rights, between backbiting and defamation. When the material rights are returned to the people, they are put to some use and cause increase in happiness, and therefore they must not be put under the mattress. Whereas non-material rights, such as those concerning a man's honor, when returned to the people can only cause increase in distress. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Repentance from Sins Involving the Rights of Others</title>
    <question>If the sin involves the rights of another person then what form should repentance take?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The basis for the answer is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: &quot;He upon whom his brother has a right, be it of the nature of money or honor, let him compensate for it before he is made to compensate for it on a day when there will be neither dinar nor dirham to deal with. Instead, if he has a good deed in his account it will be taken away from him and given to the person he had wronged. And if he has no good deeds in his account, sins of the other person will be taken from him and added to his account&quot; (al-Bukhari). Accordingly, the repentant can escape the questioning only by either giving back to the people wronged their due or seeking their forgiveness. If they forgive, he need not worry, but if they do not, then he must return their dues. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Permissibility of eating meat slaughtered by Christians and Jews</title>
    <question>I have read several articles on what foods are halal and what foods are haraam. But when I go to a restaurant I still [doubt] if what I am eating is halal. I know that the meat needs to be slaughtered in the name of Allah, and it shall be done by the people of the book. Currently in the United States, the Christians and the Jews don't follow the true Bible and the Torah. The Christians call Isa (may Allah be pleased with him) the son of God. Is the meat cut by these people halal, can it be eaten?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah).al-hamdu lillah (all praise be to Allah). The Christians and the Jews of the People of the Book in our times are indeed those People of the Book that are mentioned in the texts of shari'ah in the Qur'an and sunnah, and they are the kuffar (unbelievers) of the Jews and Christians that existed at the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). They are the people of the corrupted Torah and corrputed Injeel, as evidenced by the fact that Allah (swt) addressed them and named them &quot;People of the Book&quot; despite their being kuffar and their books being corrupted, as indicated in the following interpretations of the meanings of the aayaat: Aala 'imran: 70: O People of the Book! why do you reject the Signs of Allah, of which you are (yourselves) witnesses? Al-maa'ida: 15: O People of the Book! there has come to you Our Messenger, revealing to you much that you used to hide in the Book, and passing over much (that is now unnecessary): There has come to you from Allah a (new) light and a perspicuous Book. Al-hashr: 2: (in regards to the Battle of Bani al-Nadeer): It is He Who got out the Unbelievers among the People of the Book from their homes at the first gathering (of the forces) These kuffar among the People of the Book have certain abrogating qualities distinguishing them from the rest of the kuffar, by virtue of the fact that they are recipients of heavenly guidance and are people of previously revealed divine bookseven though they corrupted themunlike the remainder of the kuffar who have neither a previous book nor messenger, such as the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the communists, and others. Because of this distinguishing quality, the shari'ah has specified special rulings particular to the People of the Book, and exceptions specific to them in some rulings, such as allowing marriage to the the chaste and virtuous (whether virgins or previously married) among their women and the permissibility of eating their slaughtered meat, as indicated in the following ayah (interpretation of the meaning): Maa'ida: 5 This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues The preceding discussion is in regards to the general ruling with respect to slaughtered meat of the People of the Book; as for the specifics, the slaughtered meat of People of the Book can be one of several cases: That he slaughters it via the known way specified by shari'ah and he speaks the name of Allah upon it. In this case there is no problem in the permissibility of eating it. That he does not slaughter it by the way specified by shari'ah as is the case if he chokes it or electrocutes it until it dies or drowns it in water until it dies or kills it by a bullet, etc. In this case there is no doubt that eating it is forbidden since it is maita (meat of an animal that has died without properly being slaughtered) and Allah has forbidden it in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; and forbidden unto you is maita&quot; (al-Maa'ida:3) That he mentions the name of someone or something other than Allah upon it as he is slaughtering, such as the Messiah or otherwise. Likewise there is no doubt that the meat in this case is haraam, since it is among what has been dedicated to other than Allah, which is specifically forbidden in the ayah in surat al-Maa'ida: 3 (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Forbidden to you (for food) are: maita, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which has ben invoked the name of other than Allah; that which has been killed by strangling or by a violent blow&quot; That we receive their meat and we don't know if it has been slaughtered properly or not. In this case the rule of thumb is that if we don't know the way of slaughter, the default is that it is permitted if it has been slaughtered by Muslims or Ahl il-Kitaab (Fatawa Islamiyya, Sheikh Abdel-Aziz Bin Baz, 3/404), as per the generally encompassing ayah (interpretation of the meaning) &quot;and the food of the people to whom have been revealed the Book is permitted for you.&quot; (al-Maa'ida:5) If it becomes evident to us that they have not slaughtered it properly then it would not be permisible. That we receive their meat and we don't know what they have mentioned upon it, and in this case likewise the preferrable and recommended opinion is the permissibility of eating it, as per the hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari via Aa'isha (may Allah be pleased with her) that some people said to the Prophet (peace be upon him) that a people come to them with meat which they do not know whether they have mentioned the name of Allah upon it or not. The Prophet replied &quot;Mention the name of Allah upon it and eat it.&quot;</answer>

    <title>Ruling on marrying cousins</title>
    <question>Is it correct that our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) discouraged marrying cousins? Should marrying cousins be the last resort?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Can you marry your cousin? Should marrying cousins be the last resort? Praise be to Allah.Can you marry your cousin? There is no objection whatsoever in the Islamic religion for a man to marry any of his relatives except al-maharim (those forbidden for marriage ) whom Allah mentioned in Surat Al-Nisa, 4:23 (interpretation of the meaning): Prohibited to you (for marriage) are: your mothers, daughters, sisters; father's sisters, mother's sisters; brother's daughters, sister's daughters; foster-mothers (who breast-fed you), foster-sisters (who breast-fed from the same woman as you); your wives' mothers; your step-daughters under your guardianship, born of your wives with whom you have consummated marriage, no prohibition if ye have not consummated; (those who have been) wives of your sons proceeding from your loins; and two sisters in wedlock at one and the same time, except for what is past; for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Thus, when Allah mentioned for us the relatives to whom marriage is forbidden, we then come to know that there is no objection for the remainder of the family relations. Should marrying cousins be the last resort? Furthermore, there is no condition that it be the last resort as indicated in the question. Among the most prominent evidence of this fact is that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) married his daughter Fatimah to Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) and he is the son of her father's uncle, as well as the marriage of the Prophet himself to Zainab bint Jahsh (may Allah be pleased with her) and she is his aunt's daughter (i.e. his cousin); and there are many other such examples. However, a different question may be asked, namely: &quot;Is it better or preferable for a Muslim to marry someone he is not related to rather than a relative?&quot; The answer to this question varies from case to case, and perhaps it may be preferable to marry people who are non-relations, for example if one aspires to form new social ties or bonds, and regards the existence of a marriage relationship with a different family as constructive in widening the circle of social bonds.

    <title>Ruling on smoking</title>
    <question>Is smoking cigarettes Haraam?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.And peace and blessings be on His Prophet. Smoking is one of the things which has caused a lot of problems and harm these days and it has spread like wild fire. Before we discuss this topic in detail, we should know that Allaah the Almighty has divided things in the world into two types, good or permissible (al-tayyibaat, al-halaal) and evil or prohibited (al-khabaa'ith, al-haraam), and there is no third type. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning) in surat al-A'raaf (7:157): &quot;And He makes good things halaal for them and bad things haraam.&quot; Considering this fact, smoking can either be permissible and good or prohibited and evil. Thus, we present some of its characteristics and let the person asking the question see himself in which type lies smoking. There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for health. It is one of the major causes of lung cancer and other diseases. It is also one of the major causes of death. Since, it is known that the Islamic law prohibits everything that is harmful for a human being. Allah said (interpretation of meaning): &quot;Do not kill yourself. Allah is Merciful unto you.&quot; (Surat al-Nisaa' 4:29) In addition, His Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;There is no harm or causing of harm (in Islaam).&quot; (Arabic &quot;laa darar wa laa diraar&quot;) He (peace and blessings be upon him) also said: &quot;A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ... his body as to what he engaged it in.&quot; Smoking also goes against the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him): &quot;Your body has a right on you.&quot; There is no disagreement among the physicians and sane people that smoking is harmful for the health of others who inhale the polluted breath of the smoker. Medical research has proven the harmful effects of smoking mothers on their children. The offensive smell caused by smoking is a source of pain to the worshippers of Allah among humans and angels. The angels are offended and suffer from the same things that the human beings suffer from. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Those who cause harm to believing men and women without any reason do a great sin.&quot; (Surat al-Ahzaab, 33:58) The money that is spent on cigarettes is used on buying a harmful thing and is therefore an extravagance. Allah said (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; and do not be extravagant wasters. Those who are extravagant are kinsmen of Satan.&quot; (Surat al-Israa' 17:26-27) Extravagance (in Islam) means spending on something haraam. Spending money on cigarettes is a waste of resources as well. The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;A person will not be able to move on the Day of Judgment until he is asked about ..... what he owned as to how he spent it.&quot; Considering all that has been presented, it can be clearly seen that smoking is an evil among many others. It is not permissible to indulge in it, or buy and sell it, or even to offer it to others. It is incumbent on a person who is addicted to it that he must make all efforts and get whatever necessary treatment to stop it. If the unbelievers have understood the harm caused by smoking and made laws regarding it, the Muslims should be even more eager to stop it and treat those who are addicted to it. We ask Allah the Almighty to cure everyone indulging in this evil and help him in giving it up. Allah is the Best Guide to the Right Path.</answer>

    <title>How to Embrace Islam</title>
    <question>I have a dear friend that has converted to Islam. I am in support of her decision. Could you explain the process of how to convert to Islam?
Is it haram in Islam to date? Is there halal dating in Islam? What is the process of finding a suitable wife in Islam?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related A message of thanks How to embrace Islam The meaning of the shahadah Convert to Islam NOW before it is too late Is dating haram in Islam? How to approach a woman for marriage in Islam Praise be to Allah.A message of thanks Respected questioner (may Allah protect you from every evil), Please accept from me a well-intentioned greeting! I commend and appreciate your wise and mature sense of judgment in supporting your friend's decision to accept Islam. It shows admirable wisdom and a balanced sense of sagacity and understanding of this blessed event. How to embrace Islam Regarding the procedure for embracing the religion of Islam, it is actually an extremely simple process, without complication or prolongment. This is because it is something between a person and his Lord and there are no other parties involved. All that is required of a person in order to embrace Islam is that he or she pronounces the two testaments of belief in the Islamic creed, believing in their meaning, then to take a complete bath with the intention of (ritual) purification in order to start performing prayers (note to ensure complete cleanliness one should shave pubic and under-arm hair, and a man should be circumcized if he is not already--Islam places great emphasis on proper hygiene and personal cleanliness). The meaning of the shahadah As for the two testimonies of creed, the first is &quot;ash-hadu an la ilaha illa Allah&quot; (I testify that there is no deity other than Allah), which means that one believes and confirms that there is nothing to be worshipped other than Allah and that one is prepared to implement His divine rulings and guidelines (Shari`ah) for all aspects of life. The second is &quot;ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasool ullah&quot; which means the belief that Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) is the seal of the prophets (i.e. the final one), whom Allah has sent with the Islamic religion to supercede all other previous religions and that it is obligatory to comply with what he has enjoined, and to abstain and renounce all that he has prohibited and restrained. Convert to Islam NOW before it is too late I tend to gather from your question that there is a degree of pondering on your part or inclination towards embracing the Islamic religion, joining the example of your friend. I would invite you to carry through with it without excessive delay and reluctance , for one does not know when one's fate will come. So why not meet one's unavoidable fate as a believer in Allah (God) and the Hereafter, a member of the religion of Islam? It is the religion which Allah has specified that He will not accept any other religion besides it, and He will not save anyone from Hell besides its followers. Undoubtedly, this step will be the greatest thing that you will ever have experienced in your life. Surely you will not regret it at all and Allah will help you to surmount the difficulties you perhaps may face in your path after accepting Islam, such as the scorn of some relatives or family members or the alientation of some friends. However, the step in fulfilling your destiny is much more important and significant than all this. We pray for you to be bestowed with grace, and may Allah guide you to success. Waiting for glad tidings in the near future, may Allah guard and protect you. For more about the pillars of Islam, please see this answer: 13569 Is dating haram in Islam? I was extremely pleased to receive your questions regarding the nature of the relationship between men and women in Islam. Regarding the issue of dating in Islam , one must first define what is meant by &quot;dating.&quot; If dating is understood to mean how a man and a woman get to know each other for the purpose of marriage, then there are certain guidelines and established procedures which can be discussed. However, if dating is understood to refer to casual relationships between men and women for the purpose of &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;going out&quot; and such, then there is no provision for this in Islam. Such a situation is not considered respectful for either the man or the woman, nor is it constructive for the concept or the building of the family or society or social responsibility. Opening the door to relationships of love and infatuation and passion and pre-marital sex is categorically prohibited in Islam. It does not lead to the establishment of a family nor to proper and virtuous upbringing of children nor to stability and mutual care and tranquility and peace of mind between a man and woman. Rather, dating leads to disorder, the disgracing of one's honor and dignity, and to a lifestyle similar to that of animals, and to that of illegitimate children who are subjected to a life of vagrancy and loss. (Please see question # 61 which addresses the issue of prohibition of pre-marital relationships). How to approach a woman for marriage in Islam As for the former case, regarding how a man and a woman come to know each other for the purpose of marriage , it varies from circumstance to circumstance. Normally if a man has the desire to marry and has the ability to accept the responsibility, and he does not have anyone in mind, he will ask his friends, family, and relatives if there is a lady that may be suitable for him and his expectations among their acquaintances and relatives. If someone is suggested, he normally asks about her extensively, about her religious observance, her personality, her knowledge, strengths, weaknesses, suitability as a wife willing to accept all the relevant responsibilities, etc. If preliminary information seems appealing, then normally she is told that there is someone interested in meeting her and she is likewise given relevant information about him. At this point, assuming the man and the woman as well as both families involved agree that there is potential, then the man usually visits the woman's family, often accompanied by members of his own. They are given the opportunity to see each other and sit and talk together, to converse modestly (but not in complete solitude) regarding whatever is relevant to making an informed judgment. The intention for this meeting should be for them to be able to make a decision whether or not they feel they are mutually suitable. Afterwards, they each evaluate their own and their families' reactions, and pray to Allah that He guides them to what is in their best interest, and to make them accept the outcome. When both sides feel comfortable and feel they know everything they need to, based on all that has been mentioned such as asking about the other person, knowing their family, meeting in person, etc., they can make a final decision whether to carry on with marriage or not. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Ban on muslim women marrying kafir (unbeliever)</title>
    <question>Can a non-muslim man marry a muslim woman?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is absolutely not permissible under any circumstances in Islamic law (shari'a) of Allah, the most esteemed and exhalted, for a non-Muslim to marry a Muslim woman, as per what He has said regarding the marriage of a kafir (unbeliever) to a Muslim woman and vice versa: (interpretation of the meaning). They are not lawful (wives) for the unbelievers, nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them... (Al-Mumtahina:10) And Allah the most esteemed and exhalted has also said (interpretation of the meaning): Nor marry (your girls) to unbelievers until they believe... (Al-Baqara:221) i.e., it is not ever permissable for someone to marry his Muslim daughter or sister or any Muslim woman for whom he is a guardian to a kafir. Islam must be exhalted and cannot be subjugated, so how could a Muslim woman be put under the care of a kafir man, when the man is normally naturally in a stronger position? In such a situation he could cause her to corrupt the practice of her religion or force her into subdual by causing her to live a life of oppression with him. He could also prevent her from practicing some of her religious rites. These are among the reasons for the aforementioned ban expressed in the previous ayaat. wallahu a'lam (and Allah is the most knowledgable).</answer>

    <title>Woman who accepts Islam and whose husband is a kaafir</title>
    <question>If a lady reverts to Islam and is married to a non-Muslim man, must she divorce this man? If he refuses to become a Muslim, can she continue to live with him?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All praise be to Allah the Almighty. If a woman becomes a Muslima and her husband is a kaafir, then it becomes mandatory for her to separate from him and it is not permissible for her to remain with him in his state of shirk (disbelief), as per Allah's injunction (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; do not send them back to the disbelieversthey are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for them&quot; (Al-Mumtahinah 60:10). It is her duty to invite him to Islam and to attempt to convince him via various approaches in the hope that Allah may accept her efforts and give her the great reward for his guidance through her. The prophet (peace be upon him) once told Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) when he sent him to a people who were idol-worshippers: &quot;Invite them to Islam and inform them what is required of them, for (I swear) by Allah, that Allah guides a man through you is better than if you had humr un-na'am (a particular kind of camel which is the most sought-after wealth among the Arabs)&quot; (Al-Bukhari, Fath il-Baari 3009). As for the course of the marriage, and what she should do if her husband accepts Islam or doesn't, Ibn ul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy upon him) said: What is indicated by evidence of his (i.e., the prophet's) ruling is that the marriage is mawqoof, or in abeyance (i.e. suspension); if her husband accepts Islam before the elapsing of her 'iddah (waiting period), then she remains his wife. If her 'iddah elapses then she has the right to marry whom she pleases or if she likes she may wait (in the hope he may still accept Islam). If he then accepts Islam, she becomes his wife without need of renewing the marriage. (Zaad ul-Ma'aad, Vol 5 p.138). wallahu a'lam.

    <title>Timing of Ramadhaan this year</title>
    <question>When is the romedon holiday? I hope the spelling is correct.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The pronunciation and spelling of the word which is closest to the Arabic pronunciation is Ramadhaan. The month of Ramadhaan for this Hijrah year 1418H is expected to commence on 30 or 31 December 1997, as will be established by sighting of the moon. Allah has said in surat al-Baqarah, 2:189 (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;They ask you [O Muhammad ] about the new moons. Tell them they are signs for people to mark fixed periods of time and for the pilgrimage...&quot; so that they may fix their times of worship and other appointments. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: &quot;Begin fasting after sighting the moon.&quot; One should note in comparing and contrasting the beginning of the month of Ramadhaan for this Hijrah year with the Gregorian date at that time. We will begin the Holy month of Ramadhaan in shaa' Allaah while the Christians will be celebrating New Year and Christmas. While we will be refraining from eating and drinking, in worship and obedience to the Lord of the worlds, they will be involved in the worst of all sins and malpractice. So Muslims should be warned against participating with them, and be sure to distance themselves from their imitation. May Allah guide us and you to the best.</answer>

    <title>Salaried imam receiving a portion of zakaat collected</title>
    <question>Dear brother in faith.
I start with the name of Allah. I would like to thank you for your prompt response for our previous answer which was of a great help to our community (all thanks be to Allah). We are still have not purchased a masjid yet. We are considering an older church, with the will of Allah, we will convert it into a masjid and a school. Therefore, we are still collecting donations, which leads to my questions:
Our Imam has been leading the efforts in gathering the donations from local sources and out of town resources. The Imam is on a bi-weekly salary and it is not in his contract to collect donations for the masjid. The Imam has suggested the idea of building or purchasing a masjid, and he also suggested collecting the donations. It has been suggested to us by one of the brothers that the Imam should get a percentage of the donations he collects according to Surah 6 Tawbah #60 &quot;Alms are for the poor and the needy, and those employed to administer the (funds)&quot; 
1. Is the Imam entitled to a percentage of what he collected; if so, what is the percentage. Note that no prior agreement with Imam was established.
2. If a percentage is to be paid, when should this percentage be given to the Imam.
3. If the Imam is not entitled for a percentage, is the board of trustees in the community permitted to give him a reward for his efforts from the money collected.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All praises be to Allaah, Lord and Sustainer of the worlds, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and upon his family and companions. Dear brothers: As-salaamu alaikum wa-rahamat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh, I ask Allah ta'ala that this message finds you all in good health and that He brings you success in all that is good. Before answering your most recent question, the following point must be made clear: Performing the duties of a mufti, a judge, an imam, a khateeb, or a mu'adhin is considered a duty of shari'ah, associated with the Hereafter, which must be rooted in one's volunteering and seeking the reward from Allah. It is not a worldly employment for profit or attaining income, and thus one cannot apply the principle of identifying a remuneration or compensation for specifically defined duties as one would do in the case of a worldly employment contract. If one cannot find those who are willing to volunteer to fill these duties without compensation, then it is permissible to arrange a payment for he who will execute these tasks and free himself up for them, since his duties as an imam or judge or mufti or similar functions may occupy his time such that he may not find the opportunity to gain his income through other means. Note that this payment is appointed for him for the purpose of freeing him up for his duties vis-a-vis shari'ah, and it is NOT a &quot;fee for hire&quot;, i.e. NOT a salary compensating for work done. Thus, the correct case is that he accepts money so that he can be free to make fataawa (for a mufti), NOT that he makes fataawa so that he can make money; likewise, he accepts money so that he can be free to be an imam, NOT that he works as an imam so as to make money, etc. Both the correct and invalid cases are a means to an end; what makes one correct and the other invalid is what comprises the means and what comprises the end. The accepting of money must be the means, i.e. an instrument, aiding a person to the end, which is to establish and conduct acts of worship and pleasing Allaah, and to free himself up for this. Acts of worship cannot be the means to the end of achieving an income. Now we come to your question regarding giving the imam a portion of the zakaat which he is gathering for the purpose of the charitable project. This suggestion is based on the fact that he is among those who administer the funds, a category mentioned in the aayah regarding eligible parties that may receive from the zakaat funds. This category must be identified by its definition according to shari'ah, and it is: those officials appointed by the khalifah of the Muslims and their Imam for collecting zakaat, keeping account of it, guarding it, and distributing it among those who deserve it. Among the prerequisites required of those who collect zakaat are: that they are Muslim; that they are respected and trusted and don't betray; that they are reliable, trustworthy, and impartial, not inclined to favor anyone; fair and not liable to deal unjustly; knowledgeable in the required Islamic fiqh, aware of what is to be taken and what is not; disciplined and able to perform the duties. It is permissible for to give such persons a compensation from the zakaat itself or a salary from bait ul-maal from other funds. However, the official cannot take anything from the zakaat other than what the imam gives him, nor is he allowed to accept any gifts from those from whom he is collecting zakaat, as has been indicated by authentic ahaadeeth. If there is no khalifah of the Muslims to appoint those who will collect the zakaat or the khalifah has not sent someone to collect it (in a particular, perhaps remote, location), it becomes an obligation upon those who have wealth to pay it themselves and distribute it to those who deserve it. Further, the venerable Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baaz has given us a fatwah indicating that it is permissible when necessary for the president of the Islamic center, or whoever is responsible for the matters of the Muslims, in non-Muslim countries, to appoint someone to collect zakaat and to give them an appropriate portion of it as a compensation, as they would be considered as among those employed to administer it. Important observation: If the person collecting zakaat is already receiving a salary from bait ul-maal such as a judge (qaadi), mufti, imam, etc., then he does not receive anything (additional) from the zakaat because he already has an income taken from bait ul-maal. In addition, the duties of anyone in such a position includes general work for the good of the Muslims (see Al-Mughni ma'al-Sharh al-Kabeer, Vol 7, p. 319, and al-Majmoo' lil-Nawawi, Vol 6, p.188). If what he receives does not cover his needs then he would be classified as being among the poor (al-fuqaraa'), and thus would be entitled to be given enough to meet his needs. Note, again, that he should not take anything himself unilaterally, so as not to compromise his impartiality and sincerity. And Allah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is best most correct.</answer>

    <title>Changing one's name upon accepting Islam</title>
    <question>Assalamu'alaikum. I am very in love with my girlfriend, a Chinese non-muslim.We've been together for 5 years and planned to be wed soon. The problem is she is the eldest in her family and by tradition has to look after her parents who are non-muslim.I have tried to convert them to the islamic faith but they refused to submit to islam.As a muslim, i respect their decision but will i be doing a sin if they continued to livewith my girlfriend and I after we wed.I deeply love and respect them even though they rejected our religion as they are my girlfriend's parents. They however were understanding enough to not keep idols and dieties in the house after we wed but they love to eat pork (just like any other chinese) What am i supposed to do? My girlfriend doesn't eat pork anymore and she has submitted to islam willingly but she is concerned about changing her name as her parents want her to keep her original name(ie Wong Wan Pei). Can this be allowed?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) &quot;not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)&quot; (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of this issue in question #61) As for your statement: &quot;I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,&quot; by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred&quot; We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider them carefully. Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worship per of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissable and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah.</answer>

    <title>Permissibility of women visiting graves</title>
    <question>Our extended family seem to de divided on the issue of women visiting graves. Some say it is perfectly okay and do so and some say it is not permitted and do not visit graves. Please let me know if it is permissible for women to visit graves.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Paying visits by Muslim men to cemeteries is a practice of the sunnah, and it reminds one of his destiny so that he may strive for it. As the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &quot;I [once] had forbid you from visiting graves, [and I now enjoin] you to do so, so that the visit may serve as a beneficial reminder.&quot; (related by Muslim and others) and in the version of al-Haakim: &quot; for [such visits] soften the heart, bring tears to the eyes, and serve as a reminder of the Hereafter, [but be careful] not to speak forbidden expressions [i.e. while visiting].&quot; (Sahih al-Jaami' 4584) Concerning visits to cemeteries by women, scholars have varied opinions on this issue: it is allowed or preferred and their case is similar to that of men it is makrooh (reprehensible), which is the opinion of jumhoor ul-'ulemaa' (the majority of the scholars) it is forbidden, this one probably being the strongest opinion, as indicated by al-hadith al-sahih in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &quot;Allaah has cursed women who frequent graves,&quot; related by Ahmed and Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah and in one version, &quot;Allaah has cursed women who visit graves and those who build mosques and place lights upon them.&quot; (related by Abu Dawood, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaa'i and al-Haakim) This condemnation would warrant the validity of the argument against women visiting cemeteries as the lawmaker (i.e. Allaah) would not condemn something that is permissible or reprehensibleonly that which is forbidden completely. Regarding what would be the reason for this condemnation, the scholars have cited two main arguments: Firstly, that women for the most part are emotionally weaker in accepting calamities and perhaps being in sight of her dear one's graves may break into wailing and loud weeping, which would be detrimental to her religious character and harmful for her body as well. Secondly, cemeteries are oftentimes isolated places which may not be safe for someone being alone, possibly exposing a woman to people of corrupt or loose moral character. In summary, the rationale behind this prohibition is that women are often not as strong emotionally in the face of calamities, and not visiting graves prevents them from the trial and from being exposed to unnecessary fitnah. Allaah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is most correct and best.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on naming humans with the names of angels</title>
    <question>As-Salaamu 'Alaikum wa RaHmatullahBy Allah's mercy, many Muslims are entering Islaam in America.Many Muslims change their names after accepting Islaam. Some change their names to names of angels like Jibreel or Mika'il, etc. According to the 'aqeedah of Ahl-us-Sunnah, angels are neither male nor female. If one says they are male, this is bida'ah and if one says they are female, thisis kufr. So, I would like to know in light of all of this, what is the proper status of changing ones name to the nameof an angel. Is it haraam, makruh, mubaH, etc.?Please help me with this answer for I have been asking and I have yet to receive a response. May Allah rewrd you foryour answer. What advice would you give someone who has changed his or her name to the name of an angel? was-salaam.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillah., Ibn ul-Qayyim said in his book &quot;Tuhfat il-Mawdood fi Ahkaam il-Mawlood&quot; in the second chapter under &quot;What is preferred among the names and what is considered reprehensible among them&quot; said: ... and among them are the names of the angels such as Gibraa'eel and Meekaa'eel and Israafeel, it is makrooh to name human beings with these names. Ash'had said: Imam Maalik (may Allah have mercy upon him) was asked regarding naming someone the name Gibreel he abhorred it and it didn't please him; Judge 'ayaad said: &quot;... and others allowed it.&quot; Abdul-Razzak said in al-Jaami' via Ma'mar: &quot;I said to Hammaad ibn Abi Sulaiman what would you say regarding a man whose name is Gibreel or Mikaa'eel, and he responded, 'There is no objection.' (laa ba's bi-hi)&quot; Regarding the hadeeth: &quot;laa tusammow bi-asmaa' il-malaa'ikah&quot; (&quot;don't name yourselves with the names of the angels&quot;), al-Bukhari has said that the validity of its chain of narration is questionable. This means that the hadith would not be considered sahih. (&quot;Tuhfat il-Mawdood,&quot; p. 83) In al-Mawsoo'ah al-Fiqhiyya most of the scholars have ruled that using the names of the angels like Gibreel and Mikaa'eel is not makrooh (disagreeable or reprehensible). Maalik, on the other hand, has ruled that it is makrooh. (al-Mawsoo'ah al-Fiqhiyya, al-Kuwait, Vol 11/p.334) Some have stated that the meaning of Gibreel is Abdullah and likewise Mikaa'eel. See Tafseer Ibn Katheer under aayaat numbers 97-98 in Surat il-Baqarah. Thus, based on what has been presented, it is preferable not to use the names of the angels, and that we follow the rightly-guided forefathers in the naming of our children and in the naming of those who accept Islam among the non-believers. The most preferred names, no doubt, are Abdullah and Abdul-Rahman as has been related in the sound hadeeth. wallahu a'lam. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Is Ghusl Necessary Before Intercourse and After Menstruation?</title>
    <question>After a woman reaches the end of her menstruation cycle, what is the order for her before she can have relations with her husband? I mean is it mandatory for her to perform Ghusl before resuming relations with her husband?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.It mandatory for a Muslim woman to perform Ghusl after her menstrual cycle so she can perform prayers. It is not permissible for her to have intercourse with her husband until she performs Ghusl, as Allah Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;.. and when they have purified themselves (from menses, have taken a bath) approach them (i.e. for intercourse) as Allah has ordained for you (i.e. in any manner so long as it is in the vagina).&quot; (Al-Baqarah 2:222) Purification does not mean merely that the blood stops, but also the act of Ghusl afterwards. It is performed by washing the whole body, and it is Sunnah to wipe the area from which the blood effuses with a perfumed (Musk) cloth as indicated by the Hadith in which the Prophet ( peace be upon him ) says: &quot;Take a piece of cloth or cotton that is perfumed with Musk and purify yourself with it&quot;.

    <title>Men's 'awrah and wearing pants with shirt tucked in</title>
    <question>Is it permissible for a Muslim man to wear his shirt tucked in his pants, showing the shape of his legs, buttocks, etc., especially in some countries where women are not ashamed to look at them? And when they perform prayer, shouldn't they be wearing a long shirt covering their private parts while they prostrate?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The `awrah (private parts to be necessarily covered) for men includes what is between the navel and the knees as stated by the Prophet SAWS (peace be upon him), so covering it is obligatory according to Islamic law. Wearing shorts that disclose the thighs or show the shape of the buttocks, does not cover the `awrah. Neither does a dress that is transparent and displays skin complexion, nor a tight dress that shows the size, shape or bends of the `awrah. All of this is prohibited (haraam) in front of people whether the women are ashamed of looking at it or not (as asked in the question). If the trousers (or pants) are wide enough and not tight, then one may tuck his shirt in it as long as it does not display his `awrah. Covering the `awrah is obligatory during the prayer and outside it. What many people do is cover their `awrah while going to prayer but are negligent of it outside the prayer. This is a clear mistake and a wrong act which happens due to lack of understanding or as a result of a misunderstanding of the matter. May Allah cover our sins in this world and in the hereafter.</answer>

    <title>Manhaj al-salaf and ahl ul-sunnah wal-jamaa'ah</title>
    <question>My question is about manhaj salaf. I said that manhaj salaf was not different with Ahlus sunnah wal jama'ah. But my friends told that it was different. So, how do you think about that? What do you think about salafi ?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. &quot;Al-salaf&quot; (the forefathers, or ones who passed before) are one and the same as &quot;ahl ul-sunnah wal-jamaa'ah&quot; (the followers of the sunnah and the united Islamic community). They comprise those who follow the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his companions (may Allaah be pleased with him), and adhere to their principles, beliefs, and practices. This fact is witnessed by the Prophet's statement when he was asked about the party that will be saved and spared (from Hell), in which he said: &quot;They are those who are (i.e., live, act, and believe) as I and my companions are today.&quot;</answer>

    <question>Assalaam Aleikum,Is it sinful to buy liqor or other Alcoholic drinks to non muslims? As for myself I have never even tested alcohol and would discourage other muslims from doing so.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. It is not permissible for a Muslim to sell wine (or any other intoxicating substance) to non-Muslims, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &quot;Verily when Allaah forbids something, he forbids its price&quot; (i.e. forbids earning money from it). The Prophet also cursed ten types of people relating to the issue of wine, among them the one who sells it. In addition, selling it would be assisting and abetting people in sin and transgression, and Allaah the Almighty has said (interpretation of the meaning): ...and do not aid and abet one another in sin and transgression. (al-Maa'ida 5:2) It is incumbent upon you to advise those who have fallen into this evil among the Muslims, that he should repent to Allah the Most Glorified and desist this practice.</answer>

    <title>Walking in front of someone while praying</title>
    <question>Is it permissible to walk across in front of someone who is praying Salaat?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to walk across in front of someone who is praying, and it is a great sin, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said (approximate translation of meaning is): &quot;If the one crossing in front of a praying person knew what sin is upon him, it would be better for him to wait forty than walk across.&quot; Abu Al-Nadhr (one of the narrators of the hadith) said: I don't know whether he said forth days, months, or years. (Bukhari) Imam Al-Bukhari (R) has named the chapter in which he brings the hadith as follows: Chapter on the sin of walking across in front of a praying person. When the praying person is the leader in the prayer or praying alone, and he has a sutrah( some object like a peice of wood) in front of him, then walking across in between him and his sutrah is not permitted. However, if he is praying without a sutrah, it is not permissible to walk across in between him and his place of prostration. For the followers (in a jamaa'ah prayer), the leader's sutrah is enough for them. Based on this, it is permissible to walk through in front of a row if need be. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Obligation of wearing hijaab</title>
    <question>Assalam alaikoum, I'm a muslima since august 1996. My problem is about hijaab. I really want to wear it but it's very difficult to do it in France. I'm not married (I will be next year, incha Allah) and I live alone, so I'm obliged to work in my country. In France, it is extremely difficult to find a job and wearing hijaab. I feel very bad about that, I know the meaning of wearing hijaab, I don't want to wear it and to take it off later. For the moment, I have large garments and do my best to have a correct attitude. I plan to go to Boston for working next year, I know there is no problem of that kind there. My problem is just in France and just for one year, I don't want to stay there because of the reaction of French people (I'm French with no Arabic origins). So my question is: Is it possible (I mean correct) to wear hijaab all the time except for working ? thank you very much.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All praise be to Allaah, who has guided you to Islam, and we ask Allaah to give you the strength and courage to be steadfast in following His guidance. It is the greatest blessing He has bestowed upon you, and it is incumbent upon you to express and show thanks for this blessing, by worshipping and obeying Him. As for your question, wearing hijaab is a mandatory obligation which cannot be neglected. If you cannot find a place in France that will allow you to work while wearing hijaab, then you must strive to move to a country you can wear the hijaab while working, as you have indicated. It is not permissible for you to not wear hijaab under any circumstance. If it is possible for you to accelerate your efforts to get married so that you may be able to manage without working under such circumstances, this would be even better and preferable. We share with you your feelings, in the sense of religious brotherhood, of the hardship that faces our fellow sisters in France with regards to the issue of hijaab, and ask Allaah to strengthen you with the courage it takes to stand up to it. By no means is it easy, and it takes great will and determination.</answer>

    <title>All About Gog and Magog, the Anti-Christ, and the Beast</title>
    <question>Can you give us an idea about the Dajjal, Al-Dabbah and Yajuj and Majuj?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Three major signs of the Day of Judgement The Antichrist (Al-Dajjal) Gog and Magog The Beast Praise be to Allah.Three major signs of the Day of Judgement There follows a brief description from the Quran and authentic Sunnah narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) about Gog and Magog, the Antichrist, and the Beast which are three major signs that will precede the Hour and will come at the end of time just before the Day of Resurrection. The Antichrist (Al-Dajjal) The Dajjal  a man created by Allah, who will appear at the end of time because of something that makes Allah angry. He will spread corruption on earth and will claim divinity, calling on people to worship him. People will be tested by the extraordinary powers that Allah will grant him, such as causing rain to fall, reviving the earth with vegetation and extracting the treasures of the earth. The Antichrist will be a young man with a ruddy complexion, short of stature, with curly hair. He will be one-eyed; his right eye will be flat and his other eye will have a thick piece of flesh over it. Written between his eyes will be the word Kafir (disbeliever). Most of those who follow him will be Jews. He will meet his end at the hands of Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus the son of Mary) who will kill him with a spear in Lod, which is in Palestine. Gog and Magog Yajuj and Majuj are two disbelieving tribes from among the sons of Adam. They have wide faces and small eyes. They used to spread mischief on earth, so Allah gave Dhul-Qarnayn the power to build a barrier to detain them. They will keep on digging at it until Allah gives them permission to come out at the end of time, after Isa (peace be upon him) has killed the Dajjal. Gog and Magog will emerge in huge numbers and will drink up the lake of Tiberias (in Palestine). They will spread mischief on earth and no one will be able to resist them. Jesus (peace be upon him) and the believers with him will take refuge in Mount Tur until Allah destroys Yajuj and Majuj by sending worms that will eat their necks. Then Allah will send rain to wash away their bodies into the sea and cleanse the earth of their stench. The Beast Al-Dabbah is a great creature which Allah will cause to emerge when the people become corrupt. It will speak to mankind and exhort them, having the ability to reason and speak. It will make marks on the peoples noses which will distinguish the believers from the disbelievers. (For more, please see Ashrat al-Saah by Yusuf al-Wabil or al-Qiyamah al-Kubra by Umar al-Ashqar). The responsibility of the Muslim is to believe in what was narrated from Allah and His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him). How many wondrous and strange things has Allah created in this world, which speak of His might and power, may He be glorified and exalted. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Receiving meat as a gift from non-Muslim parent</title>
    <question>Assalam'alaicum wa rahmatoullahi wa barakatouh
My father, who is a non-Muslim, is very generous.As he knows that my husband and I don't have a lot of money, he gives us all the meat we need. We know that we should eat only the meat which has been slaughtered by Muslims, but what can we do with all the meat my father gives us? Are we going to throw it in the garbage? One may say that we should tell him where to buy it (i.e. halal store), but when someone gives you food so generously, it would be very impolite to tell him where he should go to buy it, wouldn't it?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.wa alaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh All Praise be to Allaah. First of all, we pray that Allaah hastens with blessing your generous and considerate father with the guidance of Islam, for indeed He is The All-Hearer, and the One who grants the requests of His worshippers. It is incumbent upon you to invite him to Islam and show him and explain to him the light of truth. Your should solicit the assistance and participation of your husband in this effort as well. Second of all, regarding the ruling on eating the meat found in non-Muslim countries, please refer to question # 103. Thirdly, a Muslim should be clever and sagacious in choosing the appropriate words and gentle-mannered approach to inform such a kind person of the place where one can buy &quot;halaal&quot; meat. Since he is already spending money on the meat whether he buys Islamically-slaughtered meat or otherwise, your guiding him to the appropriate place preserves the benefits and interests from all facets, i.e.: not refusing his gift; and achieving the permissibility of eating the meat. In fact, it would be a wise idea even for the meat he buys for himself and his house, as it will be better and healthier. Perhaps you could approach him with the idea as a suggestion and not as a firm requirement, explaining to him the reasons behind it both from the point of view of the Islamic shari'ah as well as health reasons. Thus, it would not be something you are presenting as forcing your opinion upon him; rather, you would express the importance of the issue for you, while at the same time complimenting and praising him for his generosity, expressing your embarrassment for having opened the subject. I would expect such a generous man to accept a well-mannered approach, don't you think?</answer>

    <title>Interweaving the name of Allah and Muhammad</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on having the word allaah and the word  muhammad  written in an interwoven fashion on the door of a mosque?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Among what the Islamic shariah asserts is the binding and coupling of the testimony of oneness for Allah and the testimony of the calling and message of prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Examples of such linking are in the adhan for salaat and in the iqaamah for it. Additionally, in a hadith the prophet (peace be upon him) teaches: Islam was built upon five pillars: to witness that there is no deity except Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah . It represents what a mukallaf (one who is legally capable, liable for ones actions, and obliged to perform required acts, which in Islamic law, shariah, starts at puberty) is required to believe. It must be understood together, and are pronounced together as a testimony of belief. As for writing it interwoven, nothing is available neither in the Book of Allah nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). As a result, there is great danger in this. For it has a resemblance to the false precept in the Christian faith of trinity, and the concept that the father and the son and the holy spirit are one deity. Further, it could be construed as an emblem representing the false faith of the unity of existence. In addition, it may be used as support for the extremism in the Prophet and worshipping him with Allah. Therefore, writing the name of Allah (the Most High) with the name of his prophet Mohammed (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in this way, i.e. making the letters of their names interwoven and the crossing of the letters of each of their names with the other, must be prevented. It is even not permissible to write (Allah - Muhammad) on the door of the masjid, nor in other locations, due to the confusion, misrepresentation, and serious concerns described and warned of above.</answer>

    <title>One who lives among people who commit shirk</title>
    <question>A man lives within a community that commits shirk (polytheism) by appealing for help from other than Allah. Is he allowed to pray with them with their leading the prayer? Is it obligatory to abandon them? Is their Shirk considered shirk al-akbar (great and serious act of disbelief by associating other beings with Allahs supremacy)? Is alliance with them treated the same as alliance with true non-believers?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If the condition of those with whom you live is as you mentioned, appealing for help from other than Allah, such as appealing for help from the dead and the non-living or the trees or stones or planets and the like, then they are committing the greatest shirk which causes expulsion from the community and faith of Islam. It is not allowed to ally with them just as it is not permissible to ally with non-believers. Praying behind them is not valid. It is not allowed to mix socially with them nor to reside amongst them except for the one who calls them to the truth with knowledge, and sees hope that they will accept and that their religious condition will become correct due to his efforts. Otherwise, it becomes obligatory for him to abandon them and to join a different community in which he can work with on establishing the fundamentals of Islam and its branches and reviving the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him). If he is not able to find the proper community, he should seclude himself from all communities, even if he experiences harshness, as has been related by Huthaifa (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The people used to ask the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) about goodness. And I used to ask him about evil from fear of falling in it. So I said, O Messenger of Allah, we used to be in ignorance and evil but Allah gave us this goodness, so is there evil after this goodness? He said: Yes. So I said is their goodness after this evil? He said Yes and it has some darkness I said what is its darkness? He said: A people following an example other than my example and calling to a guidance other than my guidance; you would agree with some of what they do and disagree with some. So, I said is there any evil after that goodness? He said: Yes, callers on the doors of Jahanam (the Hellfire); whoever answers their call to it are thrown in it. So, I said: O Messenger of Allah describe them to us. He said: They are from amongst us and they speak with our tongues I said: O Messenger of Allah, what do you command me to do if this happens in my time. He said: Adhere to the community of Muslims and their leader. So, I said: What if there werent a community of Muslims nor a leader? He said: Then seclude yourself from all the communities, even if you were to bite on the root of a tree until death Mutafaqun alayh (lit. agreed upon, i.e. narrated by both Muslim and Bukhari).

    <title>Ruling on loving non-Muslims</title>
    <question>Assalamu'alaikum. I am very in love with my girlfriend, a Chinese non-Muslim.We've been together for 5 years and planned to be wed soon. The problem is she is the eldest in her family and by tradition has to look after her parents who are non-Muslim.I have tried to convert them to the Islamic faith but they refused to submit to Islam. As a Muslim, I respect their decision but will I be doing a sin if they continued to live with my girlfriend and I after we wed. I deeply love and respect them even though they rejected our religion as they are my girlfriend's parents. They however were understanding enough to not keep idols and deities in the house after we wed but they love to eat pork (just like any other Chinese) What am I supposed to do? My girlfriend doesn't eat pork anymore and she has submitted to Islam willingly but she is concerned about changing her name as her parents want her to keep her original name(i.e. Wong Wan Pei). Can this be allowed?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allah. First of all, we praise Allah the most glorified that He guided this woman to Islam and that you are now allowed to marry her under Islamic law (shari'ah). May Allah the Almighty help you to remain firm toward your faith. Out of compassion and caring for your sake, please allow me to reproach a particular aspect of your question, which is that you did not indicate any regret on your part regarding the sinful and forbidden relationship of taking a girlfriend and continuing with her in a friendship that angers and displeases Allah regardless of the extent of that friendship. Your question focused on a secondary issue regarding the ruling on changing one's name which is not as serious as what you have practiced for the past five years. Allah the most glorified has forbidden such an indecent relationship in the Qur'an (interpretation of the meaning, ) &quot;not committing fornication, nor taking them as lovers (i.e. girlfriends)&quot; (Al-Maa'ida, 5:5) So, it is obligatory upon you to repent to Allah and to regret what has passed and to have the firm will not to return to the same action again, and to do good deeds and perform acts of worship to expiate the evils of that sin, and Allah is surely forgiving and merciful. (Please see also similar discussion of this issue in question #61) As for your statement: &quot;I deeply love my girlfriend's parents even though they rejected our religion,&quot; by Allah it is extremely astonishing how a Muslim man that believes in Allah and the last day can love people who are non-believers that don't believe in Allah and the last day and don't forbid what Allah forbids and don't practice the religion of truth and also refuse the religion of Islam??! Is this not a clear violation of Allah's statement in the Qur'an in surat al-Mujadlilah 58:22 (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day, making friendship with and loving those who oppose Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad- Peace and Blessings of Allah be Upon Him), even if they are their fathers or their sons or their kindred&quot; We are not saying to you curse them or pick up arms against them; however, it is obligatory upon you to abhor them for their disbelief and their denial of the Lord of the worlds and to hate the invalid and untruthful religion that they are practicing. On the other hand, there is no objection for you to treat them with kindnesswhile disliking them in your heartand to be amicable towards them so that perhaps Allah will guide them through you. You will find no conflict or contradiction between these two ideas if you consider them carefully. Furthermore, there is no objection to her parents living with you after marriage if they do not perform forbidden acts in the home (e.g., eating pork, drinking alcohol, etc.) As for the question raised at the end of your letter regarding changing her name, the answer is: if the name of the person has a forbidden meaning, like the name of an idol or one of their deities or a name that means worshipping other than Allah, such as Abdul-Maseeh (worshipper of Jesus the messiah) or Abdul-Hussain (worshipper of Hussain) then it is mandatory to change it. However, if its meaning is permissible and not objectionable, e.g. if it means one of the colors such as red or green or a vocation like carpenter or baker, then it is OK and it is not obligatory to change it. However, if changing the name in official documents would cause the person much distress or harm, then it suffices to change it amongst his family and acquaintances. Finally, I ask Allah to give you and this woman a halaal (lawful and good) and blissful life, full of imaan (faith) and taqwa (piety - God-fearing) and enriched with righteous posterity. All success is from Allah.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on a menstruating woman entering rooms etc. attached to the mosque</title>
    <question>In America there is a mosque which
   consists of three levels or floors. The top floor is the womens prayer hall, the
   floor beneath it is the main prayer hall, and the floor beneath that is a kind of
   basement, in which there are washrooms, a room for Islamic magazines and publications, and
   classrooms for women; there is also an extra place for women to pray.Is it permissible for menstruating women to enter this lower level?Also, there are pillars in the mosque which interrupt the rows of
   worshippers, splitting a row into two halves. Does this break the row or not?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If the building you describe was intended as a mosque, and the people on the higher and lower floors can hear the voice of the Imaam, then the prayer of all of them is valid. In this case it is not permissible for menstruating women to sit in the place that is prepared for prayer in the lower level, because it is part of the mosque. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: I do not make the mosque permissible for menstruating women and those in a state of ritual impurity. As for a menstruating woman passing through the mosque for some purpose, as long as she takes care to ensure that no blood leaks, then there is nothing wrong with this, because Allh says (interpretation of the meaning):  Approach not As-Salaah (the prayer) when you are in a state of Janaabah (i.e., when you are in a state of sexual impurity and have not yet taken a bath) except when travelling on the road (without enough water, or when passing through a mosque) [al-Nisa 4:43] And it was reported that the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told Aaishah to fetch his prayer rug from the mosque, and she said that she was menstruating. He SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told her: Your menstruation is not in your hand. But if it was not the intention of those who established this mosque that the lower floor was to be part of the mosque, but it was to be a storeroom or to serve some other purpose, as mentioned in the question, then it does not come under the rulings governing mosques. It is permissible for menstruating woman and those who are in a state of impurity to sit there. There is nothing wrong with praying there in the places that are pure (taahir) and are not part of the washrooms, as it is permissible to pray in all clean places where there is no shari reason not to pray. But anyone who prays there cannot be considered to be following the imaam who is praying on the upper floor, if he cannot see him or any of the people who are praying behind him, and because this is not a part of the mosque, according to the more correct scholarly opinion. With regard to the pillars which interrupt the rows, they do not adversely affect the prayer, but if it is possible to form the rows in front of or behind the pillars so that the row will not be interrupted, this is better. And Allaah is the source of strength.</answer>

We Muslims know well the aayah (Quraanic verse) in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad) whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) (Deut, xviii 15) and the Injeel (Gospel) (John, xiv 16),  he commands them for Al-Maroof (i.e. Islmic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained); and forbids them from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful AtTayyibaat (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), and prohibits them as unlawful AlKhabaaith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaahs Covenant with the children of Israel), and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Quraan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful [al-Araaf 7:157] Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse:  Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)  this is a description of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the books of the Prophets who gave their nations the glad tidings of his coming and commanded them to follow him. This description is still there in their books and their scholars and rabbis know it. Imaam Ahmad narrated: Ismaaeel told us from al-Jareeri from Abu Sakhr al-Aqeeli, a man from among the Bedouin told me, I brought a milch-camel to Madeenah during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). When I had sold her, I said, Let me meet this man [the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] and listen to him. I met him walking between Abu Bakr and Umar, and I followed them until they came to a Jewish man who was reading from a scroll of the Torah, consoling himself for the plight of his son who lay dying, a boy who was very handsome and good looking. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, I ask you by the One Who revealed this Torah, do you find any mention in this book of yours of my attributes and my coming? The man gestured with his head to indicate No. But his son said, Yes indeed, by the One who revealed the Torah, we do find mention of your attributes and your coming in our book, and I bear witness that there is no god except Allaah and that you are the Messenger of Allaah. [The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)] said, Keep this Jew away from your brother. Then he took care of shrouding him and praying [the funeral prayer] over him. This is a qawiy jayyid hadeeth. It was narrated that Ataa ibn Yassaar said: I met Abd-Allaah ibn Amr and said, Tell me about the attributes of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) described in the Torah. He said, Yes, by Allaah he is described in the Torah as he is described in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner [al-Fath 48:8]  and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger; your name is al-Mutawakkil; you are not harsh and aggressive; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes. Ataa said: Then I met Kab (who was one of the People of the Book who had become Muslim) and I asked him about that, and he told me exactly the same, not even one letter was different Al-Bukhaari narrated in his Saheeh that Ataa ibn Yassaar said:  I met Abd-Allaah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas (may Allaah be pleased with him) and said, Tell me about the description of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Torah. He said, Yes, by Allaah, he is described in the Torah in some of the same terms as he is described in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness, as a bearer of glad tidings, and as a warner [al-Fath 48:8]  and as a saviour to the unlettered; you are My slave and My messenger; your name is al-Mutawakkil; he is not harsh and aggressive, and he does not make a noise in the market-place; he does not repay evil with evil, rather he overlooks and forgives; Allaah will not take him (in death) until He has straightened a crooked nation through him so that they will say that there is no god except Allaah, and has opened hard hearts, deaf ears and blind eyes. (al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2125) Allaah did not send any Prophet without taking from him the covenant and promise that if the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) were to appear during his lifetime, he would follow Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Allaah says in Soorat Aal Imraan (which no Christian reads with an open mind but he will become Muslim) (interpretation of the meaning): And (remember) when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allaah), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him. Allaah said: Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)? They said: We agree. He said: Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this). [Aal Imraan 3:81] Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary (tafseer) on this verse: It is said that Allaah took the covenant from the Prophets that they would confirm one another, and He commanded them to believe in one another. This is the meaning of believing and helping (you must, then, believe in him and help him) Taawoos said: Allaah took the covenant from the first Prophets that they would believe in the Message of the later Prophets The Messenger here is Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), according to the view of Ali and Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with them). Allaah took the covenant from all the Prophets that they would believe in Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) if they met him, and He commanded them to take the same covenant from their nations. If you want to know more about the references to the coming of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Bible (even after it has been altered!) we refer you to the books Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the Bible and What the Bible says about Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) by Ahmad Deedat. We ask Allaah to guide you.</answer>

    <title>A woman asking for divorce because of herhusbands addiction</title>
    <question>A sister's husband became addicted to crack cocaine, and he beat her badly, threw a knife at her and tried to kill her, and abandoned her for four months. She requested a khula from the Imaam of the community and even though everyone could see how badly she was beaten (scars, bruises) and that her husband was no longer home, the Imaam refused to nullify the contract unless the wife drew up a written summary on paper of why she wanted a khula, which as she puts it &quot;is long as a book.&quot; She refused to write it, and she did not get divorced. And as the weeks passed, it became apparent that the Imaam (who is a part of the bid'ah of giving bay'ah) was incompetant and handled the situation badly. Her husband rehabbed himself, and came home, and she accepted him back, and months later, his addiction came up again and he left weeks ago. She now wants a khula again, but she does not know what to do. Please Advice.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.the Lord of the Worlds. If what is described in the question is true, then it is a lesson and a warning about how sin can destroy homes and families. Every Muslim must repent to Allaah and give up sin and disobedience. It is very strange that this sister does not want to write down her reasons for asking for divorce. She should respond to this request what harm could it possibly do? If the influential person who is responsible for the affairs of the Muslim community in that place sees that there is no possibility of reconciling the two partners and continuing the marriage, he should issue a divorce (khula divorce instigated by the woman) freeing her from the husband, on conditions that are mutually acceptable. We ask Allaah to protect our families and the families of all Muslims from fitnah (temptation, tribulation), and to rectify all our affairs.</answer>

    <title>Status of witr prayer while traveling</title>
    <question>If you traveling and you are shortening your prayers, is the witr prayer still wajib?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The majority of scholars (jumhoor ul-'ulmeaa') assert that salaat ul-witr (witr prayer) is a sunnah mu'akkada (confirmed sunnah that the Prophet peace be upon him, practiced consistently), and that it is not obligatory. This is based on the hadith (saying) regarding the bedouin who once came to the Prophet asking about Islam, the Prophet answered, &quot;Five prayers within one day-and-night.&quot; The bedouin asked, &quot;Am I obliged to other than those?&quot; The Prophet replied, &quot;Unless you volunteer of your own.&quot; (al-hadith muttafaqun alaih.) Some scholars have said that qiyaam ul-layl (prayer at the heart of night) and salaat ul-witr are the best of the voluntary prayers (al-nawaafil). Therefore, one should consistently practice them and not neglect them. The Prophet did not neglect the prayers during night nor two rak'ah before al-fajr neither in residence nor in travel (as related in al-sunnah al-sahihah).</answer>

    <title>How many adhaan for fajr</title>
    <question>How many adthans are there for fajr? If people are in the mosque do you still say &quot;prayer is better than sleep&quot; I heard it is a biddah to do this. Apparently there is a hadith to this effect. Could you send something?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There were two calls for salaat ul-fajr (prayer) at the time of Allaah's Messenger (peace be upon him), the first just before dawnfor those who are awake performing night prayers( Qe iaam Al-lyl) so as for them to either rest for Fajr or have food if they intend to fast the next day, and for those who are asleep in order they may begin to arouse and be ready for Fajr( since it is preferred as early as possible)and the second at the actual time of fajr to indicate the appropriate time and to call people to the prayer, among other benefits of the adhaan. Regarding the second point, jumhoor al-'ulemaa' (majority of the scholars) agree that the statement (within adhaan for fajr) &quot;prayer is superior to sleeping&quot; should be said in the second call to prayer. Hence, the caller or mu'athin should adhere to the saying phrase and recite it even if people are inside the mosque. It contains benefits which might be slip one's mind. Moreover, it reminds people of the very fact: &quot;prayer is superior to sleep&quot; which concerns the immediate day as well as all forthcoming days. Muslims benefit from it even when they are already in the mosque and gain the reward of repeating it after mu'athin, as per the saying of the Prophet : &quot;If you hear al-Mu'athin, say [i.e, repeat] as he says&quot; which is hadith sahih. Perhaps women and children who live near the masjid may benefit as well, and even the Muslims among the jinn. Additionally, there may be some people who feel sleepy inside the mosque or those who have nodded off while sitting. Thus, Muslims should preserve and practice this sunnah and not abandon it. May Allaah make us all successful in following the sunnah and vigilant in adhering and preserving it.</answer>

    <title>Foods produced in
      the West, such as gelatin</title>
    <question>For a great time now my community and I have been concerned with the issue of foods such as Gelatin, mono and dyglycerides, pepsin and rennetAll these thing are in our foods today and yet we do not know what we can eat and the reason for each. PLease give me a very detailed response that could end this trouble.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Allaah has blessed His slaves by creating for them all kinds of provision on earth, and He has permitted them to eat from that which is halaal (permissible) and good; this includes very many things, it is not limited. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth, and follow not the footsteps of Shaytaan (Satan). Verily, he is to you an open enemy. [al-Baqarah 2:168] Allaah forbids a limited number of foods, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): Say (O Muhammad): I find not in that which has been revealed to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be Maitah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering or the like), or the flesh of swine (pork); for that surely, is impure or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah (or has been slaughtered for idols, or on which Allaahs Name has not been mentioned while slaughtering). [al-Anaam 6:145] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the eating of every carnivorous animal that has fangs, and every bird which has talons. (Narrated by Muslim, 6/60) And he forbade the flesh of (domestic) donkeys (narrated by al-Mukhari in al-Fath, no. 4215). Of the foods which are to be found nowadays, some of them are clearly haraam, such as dead meat [from an animal which has died naturally as opposed to being slaughtered properly] and pork. Some foods may contain ingredients and derivatives which come from haraam sources, so we have to find out where they come from so that we may know what the ruling is concerning them. The gelatin which was mentioned in the question may originate from the skin, muscles and bones of haraam animals such as pigs. Hence gelatin which is derived from collagen which comes from pigs is haraam, because it is as if the pig had been turned into salt. The most correct view is that it is haraam even if it has been changed, so long as it originally came from a pig, which is haraam. The fats which are used in foods come either from vegetable sources or animal sources. If they come from vegetable sources they are halaal, so long as they have not been mixed with anything that is impure (najjis) or anything that could contaminate them. If they come from animal sources, they are either from animals that we are permitted to eat or animals that we are not permitted to eat. If they come from an animal that we are permitted to eat, then they come under the same ruling as the meat of that animal. If they come from an animal which it is haraam for us to eat  such as pigs  then we look at whether they are used in foods or for other purposes. If they are usedfor non-food purposes, e.g. many fats are used in making soap, then there is a difference of scholarly opinion, but the most correct view is that they are haraam. If they are used in foods, e.g., pig fat (lard) is used in making sweets and other foods, this is haraam. With regard to cheese: if it is made from the milk of an animal which we are not permitted to eat, then according to scholarly consensus it is not permissible to eat it. If it is made from the milk of an animal which we are permitted to eat, and it is known that it is made with rennet that has been derived from an animal slaughtered according to shareeah andit has not been mixed with any najaasah (impurity), then it may be eaten. If it was made with rennet derived from dead meat, there is a difference of scholarly opinion as to whether we may eat it, but the most correct view is that it is haraam. If it was made with rennet from a source which is inherently naajis (impure), such as rennet derived from pigs, then it should not be eaten. See Ahkaam al-Atimah fil-Shareeah al-Islamiyyah by al-Tareeqi, p. 482 In many cases these matters are unclear to the Muslim (he does not know the source of food ingredients). In this case, it is better to fear Allaah and be cautious. Avoiding doubtful things may be preferable to using them in these circumstances, as stated in the hadeeth narrated by al-Numaan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him) who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say  and al-Numaan pointed to hisears  That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain, and between the two of them there are doubtful matters about which not many people know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honour, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allaahs sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh which, if it is sound, all the body issound and which, if it is corrupt, all of it will be corrupt. Truly it is the heart. (Narrated by Muslim, 1599). From the above we learn that the basic principle concerning food is that it is halaal, apart from those things for which there is clear evidence (daleel) that they are haraam, such as dead meat, blood, animals sacrificed to other than Allaah and meat over which the name of Allaah was not pronounced at the time of slaughter. Concerning the foods mentioned in the question: if it is proven that they contain ingredients derived from haraam sources, it is necessary to avoid them, otherwise they need not be avoided. If you are not sure whether they contain anything haraam or not  without being paranoid or succumbing to the waswaas (insinuating whispers of the Shaytaan)  then it is preferable to avoid them as a precaution out of fear of Allaah. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Sujood Ul-Sahw if in doubt while praying</title>
    <question>Salam
The question is regarding the unsureness of the number of rakaats ones prayed. How would we go about correcting it. Some say at the end of prayer you say salam once and go into sujdah and others say you finish your prayer and than do the sujdah.
This issue is very confusing please explain.
Salam</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The prostration of forgetfulness (sujood ul-sahw) is required whenever one inadvertently adds extraneous parts or misses parts or is in doubt regarding parts of the arkaan (essential pillars) of the prayer and/or its other requirements. The question posed regards what to do when in doubt regarding the number of rakaaat prayed, and the answer is covered in the following points: First, definition of doubtfulness: when two possibilities are equally probable without knowing or feeling one is more likely true than the other. Second, when one doubts after performing salaam: One should disregard such doubt. For example, take the case of one who has completed praying dhuhr then questions after finishing the prayer, &quot;Did I really pray four rakaaat or only three?&quot; Such doubt should be disregarded completely unless it is substantiated by clear and certain indications; otherwise, it opens the door to waswasah (the whispering of Satan) and unwarranted extraneous additions to the prayer. Third, when one doubts during the prayer; this must fall into one of the following two cases: One can discern that one of the two possibilities about which one is in doubt is more likely or more certain by virtue of ones prevalent feeling or most likely inclination: In this case, one should act according to his best assumption and perform the prostration of forgetfulness after the salaam. The evidence for this opinion is what was related by Ibn Masood, may Allaah be pleased with him, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed either an extraneous addition or missed an essential part of the prayer (one of the narrators of the hadeeth was in doubt which). After saying salaam, it was said to him, &quot;Oh Prophet of Allaah, has there been a new change in [the way of performing] the prayer?&quot; He replied, &quot;Why [would you say that]?&quot; They responded, &quot;You prayed in such and such manner.&quot; So he bent his legs and faced towards the qiblah and performed two prostrations then performed tasleem (saying salaam to the right then the left). After facing towards us, he said, &quot;If something new had been introduced regarding the prayers, I would have informed you about it. To the contrary, I am but a human like you I forget as you forget, so if I forget, remind and inform me. If any of you doubts during his prayer then he should try to discern the more certain and correct case, then complete the prayer based upon it, then perform tasleem, followed by two prostrations.&quot; (Al-Bukhari, Fath Al-Baari #401). One cannot discern nor is there any prevalence apparent to indicate which of the two cases is more certain: In this case, one should assume the least of the two and continue based on this assumption, then perform the two prostrations of doubt before tasleem. An example of this would be one who while praying the dhuhr prayer is completely uncertain whether he has completed three or four rakaaat and cannot determine which is more true. Thus, he would assume the lesser of the two, i.e. three, and complete another rakaah then sit for the tashahhud, then prostrate two prostrations before saying &quot;salaam.&quot; The basis for this ruling is the hadeeth related by Abu Saeed Al-Khudri, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said: the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &quot;If any of you doubts during his prayer and he does not know how many [rakaaat] he has prayed, whether it is three or four, then he should discard and cast away his doubt. He is to continue upon what one is sure of [i.e. the lesser] then perform two prostrations before making tasleem. If he ends up [in reality] praying five [rakaaat], then his prayer will be an intercession for him; and if he ends up completely the [requisite] four [rakaaat] then it is targheeman for shaytaan.&quot; (targheeman: i.e., a way of vexing Satan and humiliating and debasing him, as well as rejecting him as a result of his failure to achieve his desire of disturbing the worshipper.)

    <title>Accepting donations from non-Muslims</title>
    <question>Can muslims accept donations from
   non-muslims to use
   in Islamic Cause?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) gave one of the chapters in his Saheeh the title of Baab qabool al-hadiyah min al-mushrikeen (Chapter on accepting gifts from the polytheists), under which heading he listed a number of ahaadeeth indicating that this is permitted. Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar commented: On this topic, Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi narrated from Ayyaad ibn Himar [??] who said: I gave the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) a gift of a she-camel. He asked me, Have you become Muslim? I said, No. He said, I have been forbidden to accept the gifts of the mushrikeen. Then al-Haafiz (may Allaah have mercy on him) quoted some of the comments made by the scholars to reconcile the texts which indicate that such gifts should be refused with those which indicate that they should be accepted. (The scholars said that) gifts should be refused when the intention behind them is to win the Muslim over (by softening his heart towards them), and they should be accepted when by doing so there is the hope of befriending that person and opening his heart to Islam. There is nothing wrong with accepting unsolicited gifts and donations from non-Muslims, and it is permissible to spend them on Islamic projects and in other ways. But asking for donations from non-Muslims carries several risks, such as being humiliated in front of them or being controlled by them. If there is no danger of such things happening, there is nothing wrong with asking. When he was still in Makkah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to ask for help for the sake of dawah, without any humiliation involved, from some of the mushrikeen, such as his uncle Abu Taalib and others. There is no humiliation involved in putting out charity boxes or circulating flyers giving account numbers for donations, and so on. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Employment in private and government sectors</title>
    <question>Finding Islamic employment is sometimes difficult. Is it necessarily incorrect to work for a state government? I feel that it's better than working for most businesses, at least better than working for businesses revolve around interest transactions.
I would greatly appreciate some direction on this. Thank You</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. Muslims must realize that the age of living estranged (religiously) in non-Muslim societies effects the proliferation of the haraam and the diminishment of the halaal. It is very possible what you have suggested is true, since the business sector specifically is more involved in interest than those in the government sector. However, I do not think that this cannot be generalized as a matter of principle in this matter. In general, we can say that it is permissible for the muslim to work in any sector as long as the work there involves halaal activities, and that it is not permissible to work in any occupation or position in any sector which would involve the Muslim in a function that is muharram. (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;... And for those who fear Allaah, He (ever) prepares a way out, and He provides for him from (sources) he never could imagine. And if anyone puts his trust in Allaah, sufficient is (Allaah) for him. For Allaah will surely accomplish His purpose; indeed, for all things has Allaah appointed a due proportion&quot;.

    <title>Conditions of Muslim womans hijaab</title>
    <question>Being a Muslim Woman,how must they wear their attire to say that she is a muslim woman.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The scholars have based the conditions of the hijaab (covering) which Muslim women must wear in front of non-mahram men on the evidence in the Quraan and Sunnah. So long as a woman adheres to these conditions, she may wear whatever she likes in public places and elsewhere, and her hijaab will be considered Islamic. These conditions may be summarized as follows: The hijaab must cover her entire body It should be thick enough to conceal what is underneath it It should be loose-fitting, not tight It should not be so attractive as to call mens attention to it It should not be perfumed It should not be a dress of fame and vanity (i.e., it shouldn't be extravagant or excessively opulent) It should not resemble the dress of men It should not resemble the dress of kaafir women It should not be adorned with any crosses or pictures of animate beings Further discussion of each of the above points will appear soon, in sha Allaah.</answer>

    <title>A minor whose parents' income is haraam</title>
    <question>If you are a minor and your parents earn income that might be haram for example they service businesses among them are bars, and deal with interest like when paying deposits on a apartments they rent out. My question is that there is I think (several hadith) where it says that Allah does not accept du'as and prayers of those who get there sustenance through haram means. If a little of the sustenance (money) is from haram means, and you are a minor in this case does hadith count in your case?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Expenditure is obligatory upon a father to his son/daughter according to the Islamic law and shari'ah, as regards his/her housing, clothing, food, drink and the like. However, the concept is not tied to being a &quot;minor&quot; in the sense of Western laws. The requirement according to Islamic shari'ah are: that the person spent upon is poor or does not own anything, or does not own or possess what is enough for his requirements and is unable to gain their own income. that the one spending has enough wealth to spend on himself and his wife. that the one spending and the one spent upon are of the same religion. When the son/daughter is in need for expenses, then he/she is allowed to take from his/her father's earning even though it is haraam (forbidden). In such a case his/her du'aa' to Allaah won't be affected, since being a minor, he/she has neither might nor power. But while doing so, he/she should abide by the following observations: Not to expand and widen the scope of taking or accepting from his/her father's illegitimate earnings. He/she should try if he/she is able to earn a halaal income to become independent and self-sufficient and no longer in need of the father's support. To try as hard as possible all ways to admonish and advise he/her parents in the hope that Allah Almighty may guide them towards repentance from haraam earnings.</answer>

    <title>Responding to attacks upon and distortions of Islam</title>
    <question>I found an offensive site to Islam. Can we do something to explain the truth?
Shukran Jazillan</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.You have discovered pages at a particular site, for which you have asked a proper rejoinder, that indeed show hostility towards the religion of Islam, ridicule the personality of our Prophet (peace be upon him) and carry false accusations and distortions. However, the matter is as said by Allaah (azza wa jall) (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;They want to blow out, with their mouths, the light that Allah has sent, but Allah has decided to bring this light to a completion even though the disbelievers do not like it&quot; (Al-Tawbah 9:32) I do not see any point in announcing the URL of their page in any other Islamic page which Muslims visit frequently. We should not propagate its existence or invite people to it even by indirect means. What I see as important is that some capable persons should send the proper translation of meanings of the following verse of Qur'an and other such verses to them: &quot;Those who disbelieve spend their wealth in distracting people from the right path, will continue to spend until it becomes a source of regret for them and then they will be overcome. And the disbelievers will be resurrected towards Hellfire so that Allaah may distinguish the evil from the righteous&quot; It should be enough to send them this and similar verses of Quran in rejoinder and to raise their anger. Doing so will be an act of worship and nearness to Allaah as Allaah (azza wa jall) has informed about the true believers (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;They suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of Allaah, nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness. Surely, Allaah wastes not the reward of the righteous&quot;(At-Tawbah, 9:120) I ask Allaah to reward you for your religious spirit and protect and support you.</answer>

    <title>Mixing or travelling with the husband's brother</title>
    <question>1. What is the position of a woman when her husband invites his brother to dinner, does she eat dinner with them, can she serve him?
2. Is the husbands brother maharam, can she travel with him?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.1. A wife is permitted to serve her husband and his guests if she is wearing complete hijaab and nothing of her body can be seen. She is also permitted to sit with them so long as there is no sitting alone with one non-mahram* man, wanton display or other cause of temptation involved. As far as eating with them is concerned, if this involves uncovering some part of her body, then she should not eat with them. 2. The husband's brother is not a mahram. The various types of mahram have been described in the Qur'aan, and this matter has already been explained under question # 316. On this basis, it is not permitted for her to travel with him. In view of the seriousness of the matter of non-mahram men, especially the husband's relatives, entering upon women, and the fact that so many people take this matter lightly, there follow a few words of important advice:Warning against non-mahram relatives entering upon women in the absence of their husbands Some homes are not free of the presence of relatives of the husband who are not mahrams of his wife. They may be living with him for a number of reasons, such as brothers who are students or bachelors. These men enter the house without there being any sense of something strange, because they are known to the neighbours as relatives of the head of the household. The neighbours know that this is a brother, or nephew or uncle. This casual approach leads to many immoral deeds that earn the wrath of Allaah because the limits that He has prescribed are not being adhered to. The basic principle in this matter should be the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &quot;Beware of entering upon women.&quot; A man of the Ansaar asked, &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, what do you think about the brother-in-law?&quot; He said, &quot;The brother-in-law is death.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, 9/330) Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: This hadeeth refers to all the relatives of the husband apart from his father and sons, who are mahrams for the wife and she is allowed to be alone with them; they are not described as &quot;death.&quot; It refers to the brother, nephew, uncle, cousin and other relatives of the husband whom she would be permitted to marry if she were not already married. Because people customarily treat this matter so lightly, and a man may sit alone with his brother's wife, the brother-in-law is likened to death, and he is the foremost among non-mahram men who should be prevented from doing so. The expression &quot;the brother-in-law is death&quot; may have a number of meanings, such as the following: That being alone with a brother-in-law may lead to religious doom if it results in sin. That it may lead to actual death if an immoral deed is committed that dictates the punishment of stoning. That it may spell disaster for the woman if her husband's jealousy leads to divorce. That you should fear being alone with a non-mahram woman as much as you fear death. That being alone with a non-mahram woman is as terrible as death. All of this stems from the fact that Islam wants to preserve families and households, and prevent anything that could lead to their destruction. What do you say now, after hearing the warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) about those husbands who say to their wives: &quot;If my brother comes and I am not here, show him into the sitting-room&quot; or a woman who says to a male visitor: &quot;Go into the sitting room&quot; - when there is no-one else present in the house? To those who take the idea of trustworthiness as an excuse, and say things like, &quot;I trust my wife and I trust my brother or my cousin,&quot; we say: do not trust too much and do not doubt too much, but know that the hadeeth &quot;No man sits alone with a (non-mahram) woman, but the Shaytaan is the third among them&quot; (reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1171) includes both the most righteous of people as well as the most immoral of people, and that Islam makes no exceptions whatsoever in such reports.A real problem This is the problem: a man marries a woman and brings her to his family's home, where she lives happily with him, then his younger brother starts to enter upon her when her husband is absent, and they begin to talk in an affectionate or even passionate manner. This leads to two things: she begins to detest her husband, and grows attached to his brother, but she cannot divorce her husband, or do what she wants to with the other. This is the grievous torment. This story represents one aspect of corruption, besides which are other kinds which reach the level of immoral sexual conduct and illegitimate children. In answer to the second question, a woman is not permitted to travel with her husband's brother, who is not her mahram, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;A woman should not travel unless she is with a mahram, and no man should enter upon a woman unless she has a mahram with her.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1729). Among the conditions of a mahram for travel purposes are: he should be someone whom she is permanently forbidden to marry, such as her grandfather, father, brother, paternal uncle, nephew, etc. And Allaah knows best. * Translator's note: &quot;mahram&quot; refers to a blood-relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden, such as a woman's father, brother, son, uncle, etc.</answer>

    <title>The Merits of Islam</title>
    <question>There are many religions.
Why do Muslims think that Islam is true. Is there any factual basis?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This is a reasonable enough question for one who has not entered Islam, but one who believes in and practices this religion already knows the blessings which are his because of this religion. There are many reasons for this, which include the following: (1) The Muslim worships One God, Who has no partner, and Who has the most beautiful names and the highest attributes. Thus the Muslims focus and aim is concentrated, focused on His Lord and Creator; he puts his trust in Him and asks Him for help, patience and support; he believes that Allaah is able to do all things, and has no need of a wife or son. Allaah created the heavens and earth; He is the One Who gives life and death; He is the Creator and Sustainer from Whom the slave seeks provision. He is the All-Hearing Who responds to the supplication of His slave, and from Whom the slave hopes for a response. He is the All-Merciful and All-Forgiving, to Whom the slave turns in repentance when he has committed a sin or fallen short in his worship of Allaah. He is the Omniscient and All-Seeing, Who knows all intentions and what is hidden in peoples hearts. The slave feels ashamed to commit a sin by doing wrong to himself or to others, because his Lord is watching over him and sees all that he does. He knows that Allaah is All-Wise, the Seer of the Unseen, so he trusts that what Allaah decrees for him is good; he knows that Allaah will never be unjust to him, and that everything that Allaah decrees for him is good, even if he does not understand the wisdom behind it. (2) The effects of Islaamic worship on the soul of the Muslim include the following: Prayer keeps the slave in contact with his Lord; if he enters it in a spirit of humility and concentration, he will feel tranquil and secure, because he is seeking a &quot;powerful support,&quot; which is Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. For this reason, the Prophet of Islaam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say: &quot;Let us find relaxation and joy in prayer.&quot; If something distressed him, he would hasten to pray. Everyone who finds himself faced with disaster and tries prayer finds strength, patience and consolation, because he is reciting the words of his Lord, which cannot be compared to the effect of the words of a created being. If the words of some psychologists can offer a little comfort, what do you think of the words of the One Who created the psychologist? Now let us look at zakaat (the poor due), which is one of the pillars of Islaam. Zakaat purifies the soul from stinginess and miserliness, and accustoms people to being generous and helping the poor and needy. It will bring a great reward on the Day of Resurrection, just like other forms of worship. It is not burdensome, like man-made taxes; it is only 25 in every thousand, which the sincere Muslim pays willingly and does not try to evade or wait until someone chases him for it. Fasting involves refraining from food and sex for an appointed time. It is a form of worship, and a way in which one can feel the hunger of those who are deprived. It is also a reminder of the blessings of the Creator, and it brings rewards beyond measure. Hajj is the Pilgrimage to the sacred House of Allaah, which was built by Ibraaheem (Abraham, upon whom be peace). By performing Hajj one is obeying the command of Allaah and the call to come and meet Muslims from all over the world. (3) Islaam commands all kinds of good and forbids all kinds of evil. It encourages good manners and proper treatment of others. It enjoins good characteristics such as truthfulness, patience, deliberation, kindness, humility, modesty, keeping promises, dignity, mercy, justice, courage, patience, friendliness, contentment, chastity, good treatment, tolerance, trustworthiness, gratitude for favours, and self-control in times of anger. Islaam commands the Muslim to fulfil his duty towards his parents and to uphold family ties, to help the needy, to treat neighbours well, to protect and safeguard the wealth of the orphan, to be gentle with the young and show respect to the old, to be kind to servants and animals, to remove harmful things from the road, to speak kind words, to forgive at the time when one has the opportunity to take revenge, to be sincere towards ones fellow-Muslims, to meet the needs of the Muslims, to give the debtor time to repay his debt, to prefer others over oneself, to console others, to greet people with a smiling face, to visit the sick, to support the one who is oppressed, to give gifts to friends, to honour his guest, to treat his wife kindly and spend on her and her children, to spread the greeting of peace (salaam) and to seek permission before entering another persons house, lest one see something private that the other person does not want one to see. Some non-Muslims may do these things out of politeness or good manners, but they are not seeking reward from Allaah or salvation of the Day of Judgement. If we look at what Islam has prohibited, we will find that it is in the interests of both the individual and society as a whole. All these prohibitions serve to safeguard the relationship between the slave and his Lord, and the relationship of the individual with himself and with his fellow-man. The following examples demonstrate this: Islam forbids the association of anything in worship with Allaah and the worship of anything other than Allaah, because this spells doom and misery. Islaam also forbids visiting or believing soothsayers and fortune-tellers; magic or witchcraft that may cause a rift between two people or bring them together; belief in the influence of the stars on events and peoples lives; cursing time, because Allaah is directing its affairs; and superstition, because this is pessimism. Islam forbids cancelling out good deeds by showing off, boasting or reminding others of ones favours; bowing or prostrating to anything other than Allaah; sitting with hypocrites or immoral people for the purposes of enjoying their company or keeping them company; and invoking the curse or wrath of Allaah on one another or damning one another to Hell. Islaam forbids urinating into stagnant water; defecating on the side of the road or in places where people seek shade or where they draw water; from facing the qiblah (direction of prayer) or turning ones back towards it when passing water or stool giving the greeting of salaam (peace) to one who is answering the call of nature; and putting ones hand into any vessel before washing it, when one has just woken up. Islaam forbids the offering of any nafl (supererogatory) prayers when the sun is rising, when it is at its zenith, and when it is setting, because it rises and sets between the horns of Shaytaan (Satan); praying when there is food prepared that a person desires; praying when one urgently needs to pass water, stool or wind, because that will distract a person from concentrating properly on his prayer. Islam forbids the Muslim to raise his voice in prayer, lest it disturb other believers; to continue offering supererogatory prayers at night when one feels drowsy - such a person should sleep then get up; to stay up all night in prayer, especially one night after another; and to stop praying when there is doubt as to the validity of ones wudoo - unless one hears a sound or smells an odour. Islaam forbids buying, selling and making &quot;lost and found&quot; announcements in the mosque - because it is the place of worship and remembrance of Allaah, where worldly affairs have no place. Islam forbids haste in walking when the iqaamah (call immediately preceding congregational prayer) is given, and prescribes walking in a calm and dignified manner. It is also forbidden to boast about the cost of building a mosque; to decorate a mosque with red or yellow paint or adornments which will distract the worshippers; to fast day after day without a break . Islaam forbids building over graves, making them high, sitting on them, walking between them wearing shoes, putting lights over them or writing on them. It is forbidden to disinter the dead or to take graves as places of worship. Islam forbids wailing, tearing ones clothes or leaving ones hair unkempt when a person dies. Eulogizing the dead in the manner of the times of Ignorance (Jaahiliyyah) is also forbidden, although there is nothing wrong with informing others that a person has died. Islaam forbids the consumption of riba (interest); all kinds of selling which involve ignorance (of the product), misleading and cheating; selling blood, wine, pork, idols and everything that Allaah has forbidden - their price, whether bought or sold - is haraam (unlawful); najash, which is offering a price for something one has no intention of buying, as happens in many auctions; concealing a products faults at the time of selling; selling something which one does not own or before it comes into ones possession; undercutting, outbidding or out bargaining another; selling produce before it is clear that it is in good condition and free of blemish; cheating in weights and measures; and hoarding. A partner who has shares in a plot of land or a date palm tree is forbidden to sell his share without consulting his partners. It is forbidden to consume the wealth of orphans unjustly; to bet or gamble; to take anything by force; to accept or offer bribes; to steal peoples wealth or to consume it unjustly; to take something for the purpose of destroying it; to undermine the value of peoples possessions; to keep lost property which one has found, or to keep quiet about it and not announce it, for it belongs to the one who recognizes it; to cheat in any way; to ask for a loan with no intention of repaying it; to take anything of the wealth of a fellow-Muslim, unless it is given freely, because what is taken because of another persons shyness is haraam (impermissible); and to accept a gift because of intercession. Celibacy and castration are forbidden, as is marrying two sisters, or a woman and her aunt (paternal or maternal), whether he marries the aunt after marrying her niece or vice versa, for fear of breaking the ties of kinship. It is forbidden to make deals in marriage, such as saying &quot;Let me marry your daughter and I will give you my daughter or sister in marriage.&quot; Such reciprocal deals are a form of oppression and injustice, and haraam. Islaam forbids mutah (temporary marriage), which is a marriage contract for a period of time agreed by the two parties, at the end of which the marriage expires. Islaam forbids intercourse with a menstruating woman, until she has purified herself (by taking a bath after her period ends), and also forbids anal intercourse. A man is forbidden to propose marriage to a woman when another man has already proposed to her, unless the other man withdraws his proposal or gives him permission. It is forbidden to marry a previously-married woman without consulting her, or a virgin without seeking her permission. It is forbidden to wish (a newly married couple) &quot;Bil-rafaa wal-baneen (a joyful life and many sons),&quot; because this is the greeting of the people of Jaahiliyyah(ignorance), who hated daughters. The divorced woman is forbidden to conceal what Allaah has created in her womb (if she is pregnant). A husband and wife are forbidden to speak (to others) about the intimacies of married life. It is forbidden to turn a woman against her husband or to take divorce lightly. It is forbidden for a woman to ask for anothers divorce, such as asking a man to divorce a woman so that she can marry him. A wife is forbidden to spend her husbands money without his permission, or to keep away from his bed without good reason, because the angels will curse her if she does that. A man is forbidden to marry his fathers wife, or to have intercourse with a woman who is pregnant from another man. It is forbidden for a man to practice azl (coitus interruptus) with his free wife without her permission. It is forbidden for a man to return home from a journey late at night and startle his family, unless he has previously notified them when he will arrive home. A man is forbidden to take anything of his wifes mahr (dowry) without her consent, or to keep annoying his wife so that she will give up her wealth. Islaam forbids women to make a wanton display of themselves (tabarruj). It also forbids extreme forms of female circumcision. Women are forbidden to admit anyone into their husbands home without his permission; his general permission is acceptable so long as they stay within the limits of shareeah (Islaamic law). It is forbidden to separate a mother and child (in case of divorce); to let ones womenfolk behave foolishly (in an immoral fashion) and not say anything; to let ones gaze wander everywhere; and to follow an accidental glance with an intentional glance. Islaam forbids the eating of dead meat, regardless of whether it died by drowning, strangulation, shock or falling from a high place; eating blood, pork and anything slaughtered in a name other than that of Allaah or for idols; eating the flesh or drinking the milk of beasts that feed on filth and waste matter; eating the flesh of every carnivorous beast that has fangs and every bird that has talons; eating the meat of domesticated donkeys; killing animals by keeping them and throwing stones at them until they die, or detaining them without food until they die; slaughtering with teeth or nails; slaughtering one animal (for food) in front of another; or sharpening the knife in front of the animal to be slaughtered. In the area of clothing and adornment, men are forbidden the extravagance of wearing gold. Muslim men are forbidden to be naked or to expose their thighs; to leave their clothes long (below the ankles) and trail them on the ground for the purpose of showing off; and to wear clothes that will attract attention. It is forbidden to bear false witness; to make false accusations against a chaste believing woman; to accuse someone who is innocent; to utter lies; to slander and backbite; to call people by offensive nicknames; to spread gossip and malicious slander; to make fun of the Muslims; to boast about ones status; to shed doubts on a persons lineage; to utter slander, insults and obscenities; to speak in an indecent or rude manner; or to utter evil in public, except by one who has been wronged. Islaam forbids telling lies; one of the worst kinds of lie is to lie about dreams, like fabricating dreams and visions in order to prove ones virtue, or make some material gains, or to frighten an enemy. Muslims are forbidden to praise themselves, or to talk in a secret way: two may not converse secretly to the exclusion of a third, because this is offensive. It is forbidden to curse a believer or someone who does not deserve to be cursed. Islaam forbids speaking ill of the dead; praying for death; wishing for death because of some suffering that one is passing through; praying against ones self, ones children, ones servants or ones wealth. Muslims are told not to eat the food that is directly in front of others or to eat from the centre of the dish or platter; rather they should eat from what is directly in front of them or thereabouts, because the barakah (blessing) comes in the middle of the food. It is forbidden to drink from a broken edge of a vessel, because this could cause harm; or to drink from the mouth of a vessel; or to breathe into it. It is forbidden to eat while lying on ones stomach; to sit at a table where wine is being drunk; to leave a fire burning in ones house when one sleeps; to sleep with Ghamr in ones hand, like an offensive smell or the remainder of food (grease); to sleep on ones stomach; or to talk about or try to interpret bad dreams, because these are tricks of the Shaytaan. It is forbidden to kill another person except in cases where it is right to do so; to kill ones children for fear of poverty; to commit suicide; to commit fornication, adultery or sodomy (homosexuality); to drink wine, or even to prepare it, carry it from one place to another, or sell it. Muslims are forbidden to please people by angering Allaah; to offend their parents or even to say &quot;Uff&quot; (the slightest word of contempt) to them; to claim that a child belongs to anyone but his real father; to torture by means of fire; to burn anyone, alive or dead, with fire; to mutilate the bodies of the slain; to help anyone commit falsehood; or to cooperate in wrongdoing and sin. It is forbidden to obey any person by disobeying Allaah; to swear falsely; to swear a disastrous oath; to eavesdrop on people without their permission; to invade peoples privacy or look at their private parts; to claim something that does not belong to one or that one did not do, for the purpose of showing off; to look into someones elses house without permission; to be extravagant; to swear an oath to do something wrong; to spy on others or be suspicious about righteous men and women; to envy, hate or shun one another; to persist in falsehood; to be arrogant or feel superior; to be filled with self-admiration; to be pleased with ones arrogance. Islam forbids taking back ones charity, even if one pays to get it back; employing someone to do a job without paying him his wages; being unfair in giving gifts to ones children; bequeathing everything in ones will and leaving ones heirs poor - in such a case the will should not be executed; writing a will that concerns more than one third of ones legacy; being a bad neighbour; or changing a will to the detriment of one or some of ones heirs. A Muslim is forbidden to forsake or shun his brother for more than three days, except for a reason sanctioned by shareeah; to hold small stones between two fingers and throw them because this could cause injury to eyes or teeth; to include his heirs in a will, because Allaah has already given heirs their rights of inheritance; to disturb his neighbour; to point a weapon at his Muslim brother; to hand someone an unsheathed sword, lest it harm him; to come (walk) between two people except with their permission; to return a gift, unless there is some shari objection to it; to be extravagant; to give money to foolish people; to wish to be like someone to whom Allaah has given more of something; to cancel out his charity by giving offensive reminders of his giving; to wilfully conceal testimony; or to oppress orphans or scold one who asks for help or money. It is forbidden to treat with evil medicines, because Allaah would not create a cure for this ummah which includes something that He has forbidden. It is forbidden to kill women and children in warfare; to boast to one another; or to break promises. Islaam forbids betraying a trust; asking for charity that one does not need; alarming a Muslim brother or taking away his possessions, whether jokingly or seriously; changing ones mind after giving a gift, except in the case of a gift from a father to his child; practising medicine without experience; or killing ants, bees and hoopoe birds. A man is forbidden to look at the awrah (private parts) of another man, and a woman is forbidden to look at the awrah of another woman. It is forbidden to sit between two people without their permission; or to greet only those whom one knows, because the greeting is to be given to those whom you know and those whom you do not know. A Muslim is forbidden to let an oath come between him and good deeds; he should do what is good and make expiation for the oath. It is forbidden to judge between two disputing parties when one is angry, or to judge in favour of one party without hearing what the other has to say. It is forbidden for a man to walk through the market-place carrying something - like a sharp weapon - that could harm the Muslims, unless it is properly covered. A Muslim is forbidden to make another person get up, so that he can take his place. There are more commands and prohibitions which came for the benefit and happiness of individuals and mankind as a whole. Have you ever seen any other religion that can compare to this religion? Read this response again, then ask yourself: is it not a great pity that I am not one of them? Allaah says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&quot; [Aal Imraan 3:85] Finally, I hope that everyone who reads this will be guided to the correct way and to follow the truth. May Allaah protect you and us from all evil.</answer>

    <title>No prescribed period for consummating marriage</title>
    <question>How soon do a married couple have to consumate their marriage in Islam? If one of the partners feels uncomfortable, what is he/she
to do, if he/she does not want to consumate right away, but
would prefer to wait about 3 months?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. If a man executes a valid marriage contract with a woman then it is permissible for the two to do as they please between themselves, even with only the contract. There is no period prescribed by Islamic shari'ah between the contract and consummation of the marriage, so this issue is up to the two partners as to what they decide is most appropriate and in their best interests. It is incumbent upon both parties to consider, respect, and ensure the other one's personal comfort and ease. Thus, if the husband sees that the wife needs some time to become acclimated and develop their relationship and level of intimacy before consummation, such as 3 months, for example, he should do so, and vice versa. Likewise, it is incumbent upon the wife if she sees that her husband feels an urgent need to guard his chastity by consummating the marriage that she should not prolong the period so that he does not fall into a state of awkward discomfort and difficulty, and vice versa.</answer>

    <title>Performing aqeeqah for oneself and older children, and borrowing for it</title>
    <question>Assalam'alaicum wa rahmatoullahi wa barakatouh I heard a muslim brother and a imam saying that: a) People who have children and embrace islam should make a 'aqiqa for them
(the children), no matter how old they are and also one for themselves
because their non-muslim parents did not make one for them;

b) Making a 'aqiqa is so important that if one doesn't have the money to
make it, he should borrow that money.

However, they didn't give any references to prove what they said. What is
the truth?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.wa aliaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh. al-hamdu lillaah. (a) Jumhoor al-ulemaa' (vast majority of the scholars) agree that the aqeeqa is a sunnah mustahabbah for those who are capable of doing it and can afford it. Among its benefits are breaking the influence of the shaitaan on the new-born. It is also permissible for a Muslim to make an aqeeqah for himself if his parents did not perform it for him. Similarly, he can do it for his children even if it is after many years if he didn't do it when they were young. Refer to the book &quot;Tuhfat ul-Mawdood bi-Ahkaam il-Mawlood&quot; by Imam Ibn ul-Qayyim, Chapter 6: &quot;The Aqeeqah and its Rulings&quot;, Part 19: &quot;The Ruling for One Whose Parents Did Not Perform an Aqeeqah--Should He Perform one on His Own Behalf?&quot; for more details. It is mentioned there that Ismaa'il ibn Sa'eed al-Shaalanji asked (Imam) Ahmed regarding a man whose father informed him that he did not perform an aqeeqah on his behalf--should he perform it on his own behalf? He said, &quot;That is the father's duty.&quot; ... and it was said, &quot;Should one perform an aqeeqah on his own behalf as an adult?&quot; ... and I saw that it is preferrable if an aqeeqah was not performed as a child then it should be performed as an adult, and (Imam Ahmed) said: &quot;If someone does that I would not discourage it or regard it as reprehensible.&quot; (b) It is not mandatory for a person to take a loan in order to spend on an aqeeqah. However, if he does it then it would be considered commendable as per Imam Ahmed's opinion. It was related by Abi il-Harith that he asked Abu Abdullah regarding one who doesn't have enough to perform an aqeeqah; Imam Ahmed said, &quot;If he borrowed for it I hope Allaah would reward and provide for him by virtue that he has observed a sunnah.&quot; Refer to &quot;Tuhfat il-Mawdood,&quot; same chapter, Part 11: &quot;Regarding Borrowing for an Aqeeqah and its Rulings and Benefits.&quot;</answer>

    <question>Being a Muslim woman, how must they wear their attire to say that she is a Muslim woman?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.Scholars have specified the requirements of the Muslim-woman's proper dress before al-ajanib (lit. foreigners, i.e., those to whom marriage is permissible) from both the Glorious Quran and the Sunnah.

It should be loose and not tight on her body. It should not be decorated or ornate such as to attract onlookers. It should not be perfumed. It should not be considered libas al-shuhrah. It should not resemble the dress of men. It should not resemble the dress of the unbelievers.

Likewise, it is also permissible to donate blood to non-Muslims as long as they are not fighters of Islam. A fighter of Islam would be defined as one who fights Muslims with weapons or finances such fighting with his wealth, or helps such fighting. If one is not able to know for sure, then it suffices to act according to ghalabat ul-zann (one's best estimate or what is most likely and probable). ahabbak allaah ul-ladhi ahbabtani fih.

    <title>Signs of Black Magic and Satanic Possession</title>
    <question>My brother, after returning from a trip, started acting very strangely. He would say weird things and now doesn't talk to anyone at all. He has been sitting outside for 2 months now. He has even spit on our mother. At first we thought there was something psychologically wrong with him. However, when we took him to a mental doctor, he talked as if he was fine. We think he is either possessed by a Jinn or some magic was done to him.

How can you tell if someone is possessed or if magic was done to them? How do you remove it? My mother is getting very sick over this.</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Signs of jinn or Satanic possession Signs of black magic How to protect yourself from black magic and Satanic possession Praise be to Allah.Signs of jinn or Satanic possession People who have had experience with such situations have related that the following are among the signs of a person who is possessed by jinn (or Satan): Strong repulsion when hearing the Quran or Athan (call for prayers). Episodes of losing consciousness and/or epileptic attacks, especially when Quran is recited for the possessed person. Frequent nightmares during sleep. Tendency to avoid people accompanied by out-of-the-norm behavior. The jinni who possess him might speak when the Quran is recited for the possessed person. Madness, as stated in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Those who devour usury will not stand except as stands one whom Satan by his touch hath driven to [epileptic] madness&quot; (2:275) Signs of black magic As for a person struck by magic he might experience the following: Dislike of ones spouse, as indicated in the Quran by the following verse (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife...&quot; (Al-Baqarah, 2:102) Different attitude in the house from that which is outside the house. For example, a person will feel that he is missing his family when is outside the house but when he goes home, love changes quickly to extreme hatred. Inability to have sexual intercourse with ones spouse. Frequent miscarriage for pregnant women. Sudden change in behavior without obvious reason. Complete loss of appetite for food. Thinking or imagining one has done something when in reality one has not. Sudden obedience and/or love for a particular person. It should be noted that if a person experiences some of the above symptoms this does not necessarily mean that he is either possessed by a jinni or struck by black magic. It might be due to physiological or psychological reasons. How to protect yourself from black magic and Satanic possession As for curing this condition the following steps are recommended: Putting ones trust in Allah with a sincere belief that He is the only cure for everything. Reading Quran and known supplications expressing seeking refuge, the most important and effective of which is sura 113 and 114, Al-Falaq and Al-Nas, which were used to cure the Prophet himself. Surah 112, Al-Ikhlas, is recommended along with them, as well as the opening chapter of the Quran, Al-Fatihah. To cure black magic, some have successfully used seven lote-tree leaves. The leaves should be crushed, then mixed with water (enough for taking a bath). The following verses from the Quran are then recited: verse Al-Kursi (2:255), surah Al-Kafirun (109), surah 112, 113, 114; the verses which mention magic, which are: in surah Al-Baqarah (2:102), Al-Araf (7:117-119), Yunus (10:79-82), and Taha (20:65-69). The possessed person drinks some of the water, and the rest is used to give him a bath. Removing the elements of magic as was done by the Prophet when he was struck by black magic by a Jewish man called Lubaid ibn Al-Asim. Eating seven Aliya Al-Barniy dates (among the dates of Al-Madinah) first thing in the morning; if not possible, any dates will suffice, by the will of Allah. Cupping --removing excess blood. Offering supplications. And we ask Allah to cure your brother and ease your hardship and his, as He is the One who cures and there is no one else who can cure. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Profit and salaries made from a business financed with interest</title>
    <question>As Salam aliakum
I have purchase a business ( Dry Cleaners ) and we have borrow some money from Credit Cards, on which we are paying interest. My question is , is the money we are making and paying off our Debts is Hilal or Haram, plus the profits. Second thing, i am working their too and i take salary, is that Halal ? Thank u,,,,</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Borrowing with interest is considered one of the greatest of the major sins (al-kabaa'ir). The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) has cursed those who consume interest, and those who pay it. Borrowing money with interest is considered as peddling in it as the borrower pays it to the borrower. Whoever does this is to repent and express remorse, and he is to try as much as he can to return only the principle he borrowed without the interest, advising the person who lent him the money against this practice. If he cannot, as in the case of borrowing from interest-based banks, which rarely forgive but rather get back their dues even if by force, he is to return the principle plus the interest offering repentance to Allaah at the same time. Whatever the borrower has bought or developed in terms of legitimate and Islamically-permitted business based on the borrowed money, can remain in his possession. He is allowed to continue his enterprise and profit from it, paying sadaqah at the time on a frequent basis to purify his business and himself of the misdeed he has committed. Those who work in businesses functioning on money borrowed using interest for which they are not responsible can continue to work in such enterprises as long as the nature of the business is halaal and legitimate such as a Laundromat, etc. Allaah the Most Knowledgeable knows what is most correct and best.</answer>

    <title>Rejecting the sunnah and praying behind someone who does</title>
    <question>Assalamalaykum wa rahmatulla wa barakatuh,
My family is not very religious but I try to be, but am constantly mocked and ridiculed for trying to follow the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad and enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong. My family think I am extreme in my views because I hold hadith in high regard, whereas my father does not. He believes that a hadith explaining the commandments in the Qur'an, for example praying, should be followed, but those concerning matters outside of the Quern, for example prohibition of touching a female who is not your mehram, should not be followed. He has many other beliefs, but my question is this:
Is it permissible for me to pray behind him with him as the Imam? If not, is it permissible for me to pretend that I am praying so that he does not feel offended that I do not want to pray behind him? Because I have read in Quern that children should not hurt their parents, and one of the biggest sins in Islam is a child making his parents cry, and I feel that in telling him that I am not able to pray behind him, I would infact hurt him.
I eagerly await your response. Jazzakallahkhairum for your help.
Wa alaykum-as-salam wa rahmatulla wa barakatuh.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. The situation in which you are, dear brother, is certainly a difficult one. It is not easy to live with a father that has aberrations and perversities stemming from being misguided from the true path of ahl us-sunnah wal-jamaaah (the followers of the Quraan, sunnah, and our pious predecessors). However, a Muslim is to anticipate and seek reward from Allaah for: being patient with and persevering in dealing with your father; and, being polite when counseling and showing him the truth of guidance, using appropriate and agreeable methods that do not give your father the impression that you are trying to show superiority or arrogance, or that you are belittling him. Instead, your father should feel that the advice is from a son that acknowledges and respects his position as his father, and that your concern is out of care and veneration., as the case was with Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when calling his father to the path of truth. Allaah the Most Glorious said in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): When he (Ibrahim) said to his father: &quot;O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything? O my father! Verily, there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you. So follow me; I will guide you to a straight path. O my father! Worship not Satan. Verily, Satan has been a rebel against the Most Beneficent (Allah). O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allaah) overtake you, so that you become a companion of Satan ( in Hell-Fire).&quot; He (the father) said: &quot; Do you reject my gods, O Ibrahim? If you do not stop (this), I will indeed stone you. So get away from me safely before I punish you.&quot; Ibrahim said :&quot; Peace be upon you. I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me, ever most gracious. (surat Maryam, 19:41-47) Note that Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) addressed his father in the most subordinate and most refined, courteous, and polite expression (abati in Arabic). Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) did not say to him, &quot;I am a scholar and you are ignorant&quot;; instead, he said &quot;There has come to me of knowledge (as a Prophet) that which has not come unto you.&quot; Ibrahim (peace be upon him) showed his concern and compassion towards his fathers well-being when he said, &quot;O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Beneficent (Allaah) overtake you.&quot; When his father rejected the truth and threatened to stone him, Ibrahim (peace be upon him) replied in utmost politeness, &quot;Peace be upon you,&quot; and promised him that he will pray to his Lord on his behalf for forgiveness. This is how a righteous son should advise his misguided father. You also should know that rejecting or denying the sunnah of our Prophet (peace be upon him) is an extremely grave matter; hopefully this subject will be covered in detail as a separate issue. In brief, if your fathers bidaah (innovation in religion) takes him out of the fold of Islam, then your prayers behind him is not valid since he would be a kafir (infidel, unbeliever). Such would be the case if, for example, he insists and persists in completely rejecting the sunnah in its entirety, even after the proof and evidence demonstrating and substantiating the truth and validity of the matter is presented to him. On the other hand, if your fathers bidaah does not take him out of the fold of Islam, such as the case of refusing to perform certain acts mentioned in the Quraan and Sunnah, then it is permissible to pray behind him and your prayers are sound, and Allaah knows best. Addendum: Sheikh Muhammad ibn Salih ibn Uthaimeen has replied the following with regards to this question: Denying (the sunnah) could be of two types: a denial with regards to interpretation or a denial of rejection. If it is a denial of rejection, in the sense that one might say, &quot;Yes, I realize that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said this, but I reject it and dont accept it,&quot; then the person is a kaafir (unbeliever) and has committed apostasy. Thus, it would be impermissible to pray behind him. If, on the other hand, it is a denial of interpretation, then he is granted a respite, if the interpretation is possible and warranted by the language, and he knows the sources of Islamic law and its resources. In this case, it is not an act of kufr, but rather under the category of those who innovate incorrect practices in the religion (if his interpretation is such). It would be permissible to pray behind such a person, unless there is a beneficial objective behind not doing so, such as deterring him from such opinions, so that he may reconsider his mistaken interpretations. In this latter case, then it would be preferable not to pray behind him (if such a beneficial effect would be realized).</answer>

    <title>Celebrating Mawlid al-Nabi (Muhammads Birthday): Allowed?</title>
    <question>Why do some people accept and somenot accept the celebration of Prophet Muhamamds birthday (malwid al-nabi)? What is your opinion?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Is it permissible to celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet Muhammads birthday)? What did Prophet Muhammad do on the day of his birth? Did the Companions celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi? Did leading Muslim scholars celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi? When did the celebration of Mawlid al-Nabi appear? How to express love for Prophet Muhammad Praise be to Allah.Is it permissible to celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi (Prophet Muhammads birthday)? There is nothing in the Quran to say that we should celebrate the Mawlid al-Nabi or the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The Prophet himself did not do this or command anyone to do it, either during his lifetime or after his death. Indeed, he told his Companions not to exaggerate about him as the Christians had exaggerated about Jesus (upon whom be peace). He said: Do not exaggerate about me as the Christians exaggerated about the son of Maryam. I am only a slave, so say, The slave of Allah and His Messenger. (Reported by al-Bukhari) What did Prophet Muhammad do on the day of his birth? What has been reported is that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) made the day of his birth a day of worship, which is different to celebration. He was asked about fasting on Mondays, and he said: That is the day on which I was born and the day on which I was entrusted with the Mission or when I was first given Revelation. (Reported by Muslim, al-Nasai and Abu Dawood) Did the Companions celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi? Moreover, we know that the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) were the people who loved the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) most. Was it reported that Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), who was the closest of people to him and the one who loved him the most, celebrated the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? Was it reported that Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), who ruled for twelve years, or Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him), did this? Was it reported that Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), his relative and foster son, did this? Was it reported that any of the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) did this? No, by Allah! Is it because they were not aware of its importance, or did they not truly love the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? No one would say such a thing except one who has gone astray and is leading others astray. Did leading Muslim scholars celebrate Mawlid al-Nabi? Did any of the imams  Abu Haneefah, Malik, al-Shafi'i, Ahmad, al-Hasan al-Basri, Ibn Seereen (may Allah have mercy on them)  do this or command others to do it or say that it was good? By Allah, no! It was not even mentioned during the first and best three centuries. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a saheeh hadeeth: The best of mankind are my generation (or my century), then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people who will not care if their testimony comes before their oath or vice versa (i.e., they will not take such a matter seriously). (Reported by al-Bukhari, Muslim and al-Tirmidhi). When did the celebration of Mawlid al-Nabi appear? The celebration of the Prophets birthday appeared many centuries later, when many of the features of true religion had vanished and bidah had become widespread. Thus this celebration became a sign of ones love for the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)? But can it be possible that the Sahabah, the imams and the people of the best three centuries were unaware of it, and it was only those who came later who were aware of its importance?! How to express love for Prophet Muhammad What the Quran tells us is that love of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is demonstrated by following the guidance he brought. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Say (O Muhammad): If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. Say: Obey Allah and the Messenger. But if they turn away, then Allah does not like the disbelievers. [Aal Imran 3:31-32] The first ayah explains that love is just a claim, but the proof of sincerity is following what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) brought. The second ayah reaffirms the importance and necessity of obeying Allah and His Messenger. Hence Allah ended the ayah with a very stern warning in which those who refuse to obey are described as kafirs, and Allah does not love the disbelievers. We ask Allah to keep us safe from that. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us of the danger of not obeying him, and the danger of adding to what he brought. The celebration of Mawlid or his birthday is indeed an addition to what he brought  as all the scholars agree. He said: The best of speech is the Book of Allah, and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The most evil of things are those which are newly-invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray. (Reported by Muslim and al-Nasai). We ask Allah to protect us from bidah and to bless us by helping us to follow. Allah knows best. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Is it permissible for women to visit a graveyard?</title>
    <question>I have heard that the reason behind women not being able to visit the deceased is because the people in the graves are able to see people that are alive, naked. But this doesn't make any sense to me, and I am a little confused, because my sister and mother would like to visit my father's grave, and have visited, but I feel awkward not knowing if it is permissible or not? I don't see anything wrong with it my self, but please do clarify this situation ASAP.
Thank You very much (Jazak-Allah Khayr)</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The reason for prohibiting women from visiting graves is the ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned in question #127. It is not because dead people can see their visitors. This reason is invalid and the rules of the world of the dead people are different from the rules dealing with the world of living people. If the reason for prohibition was the ability of the deceased to see people who are alive naked, then it would also be prohibited for men to visit the graves. You need to encourage your mother and sister to make du'aa (supplication) for your father, as this offers the greatest benefit to the deceased, and it is much better than the mere visit. Tell them that this du'aa will benefit him whenever and wherever the person making the du'aa is, whether he or she is near the grave or far away from it. We ask Allaah to have mercy upon your deceased, and to give you patiencefor your loss. To Allaah we belong and to him is our return.</answer>

    <title>Hanging Quranic Verses on Walls</title>
    <question>When visiting Muslims, I noticed that many of them put verses of the Quran on the walls or pictures with the names Allah and Muhammad. I know a lot of Muslims think that it is good to do so because it will protect them and their house. Personally, I consider it a form of shirk or superstition. Is there any ruling on that subject?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.Hanging plaques and cloths containing verses of the Quran in homes , schools, social clubs and places of business, involves a number of reservations and prohibitions according to Islam, such as the following: In most cases, hanging such things on the wall is done for purposes of decoration and adornment, as the verses etc. are written in calligraphy and colorful brocade. This is an inappropriate use of the Quran, as it was revealed to guide people and to be read regularly. The Quran was not revealed to decorate walls, but to guide mankind. Some people hang up such things for blessing - which is a form of worship. The blessing as described in Islam comes from reading or reciting the Quran, not from hanging it up or placing it on shelves or turning it into artwork and three-dimensional images. This is contrary to the practice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the Rightly-Guided Khalifas (al-Khulafa al-Rashidun), may Allah be pleased with them, who never did such a thing. The best way is to follow them, not to introduce innovations in religion. History tells us that in places such as Andalusia, Turkey, etc., the adornment of houses and mosques with ornate carvings of verses only happened at times when the Muslims were weak and humiliated. Hanging up such pictures or plaques could lead to shirk, because some people think that these things are amulets that will protect the house and its people from evil and disease. This is shirk and is haram, because the One Who really offers protection is Allah, may He be glorified, and one of the means of gaining His protection is sincere recitation of the Quran and duas taught in the Quran and Sunnah. There is the risk that the Quran may be used, in such cases, as a means of promoting one's business or increasing one's earnings. The Quran should be protected from being used for such purposes. It is well-known that the production and sale of these pictures and plaques involves a great deal of extravagance and wasting money. Many of these plaques are painted with real gold, which makes using them and hanging them up even more haram. Many of these plaques involve a kind of carelessness, because the letters are twisted into complex designs that are of no benefit to anyone because they are barely legible. Sometimes words are fashioned into the shape of a bird or a man prostrating, and similarly forbidden pictures of animate beings. Verses and surahs of the Quran are exposed to misuse and abuse by this practice. For example, when moving house, they are piled up with the rest of the furniture and belongings, and other objects may be placed on top of them. This also happens when they are taken down so that the wall may be painted or cleaned. Some Muslims whose observance of Islam is lacking put these plaques and pictures up so that they can feel that they are doing something religious, in order to reduce their feelings of guilt in spite of the fact that this practice does not help them in any way. All in all, we must close the doors of evil and follow the leaders of guidance of the early centuries of Islam, whose people the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) testified were the best of the Muslims in faith and practice. If someone were to say, We are not going to abuse it or make it a decoration or exaggerate about it, we only want to remind people (about their religion) in our gatherings, our response would be: if we look at real life, will we find that this is what actually happens? Do people really remember Allah? Do they even read these verses when they raise their heads? What really happens is the opposite: people go against the words hanging over their heads, they still tell lies, engage in gossip, make fun of others and do and say evil things. Even if we assume that there are some who do benefit from these plaques etc., the fact is that they are very few, and this does not change the Islamic ruling on the matter. The Muslims must turn to the Book of Allah, read it and recite it, and act in accordance with it. We ask Allah to make the Quran a light of guidance for us, and a means of removing our grief and anxiety. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

    <title>Intermarrying among Adam and Eve's children</title>
    <question>Asalam Alaikum?
I have no doubt whatsoever, but these kind a things come to mind. Whem Adam and Eve bore children, I assume their children got married among themselves. Isnt marrying between brothers and sisters haram in the Quran? Can you recommend a good book(s) on Islamic Law covering every and each aspect of Life? Thank you very much for the generous work for the sake of Allah. Thanks.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.wa alaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh All Praise be to Allaah. As long as you are confident in your heart about your belief, no such insinuations will hurt you (inshaa' Allaah). If a doubt strikes a believer or something appears to him as a conflict between different textual sources of Shari'ah, he must believe that indeed for such doubts there are true answers and for such apparent conflicts there are solutions even if he doesnt know it or is unable to find the right answer himself. However, a person should not collect all the doubts in his heart and worry about the complexities and leave aside the learning of useful knowledge. This is because it is incumbent upon a Muslim to learn and know things which have been clearly described (Muhkamaat) in Shari'ah so that he may be able to repel the doubts. Regarding the question you have asked, it is a known fact that legislation differs from one Shari'ah to another, while the principles and beliefs remain the same in all of them. So, making of portraits was allowed in the Shari'ah of Sulayman (peace be upon him) but is prohibited in our Shari'ah. Similarly, making prostration of salutation was permitted in the Shari'ah of Yusuf (peace be upon him) but is illegal in ours. Also, war booty was prohibited for nations before us but it is completely legal for us. The Qiblah of people before us used to be towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, but for us it is towards Ka'bah. In a similar way, marriage between brothers and sisters was permitted in the Shari'ah of Adam (peace be upon him) as opposed to those that came afterwards. The following is a clarification on the issue by Haafidh Ibn Katheer, who said: Allaah allowed Adam (peace be upon him) to marry his daughters to his sons for necessity. Every couple used to have a boy and a girl. Hence, he married the girl of one couple to the boy of another. This is said by Suddi regarding what has been narrated by Abu Maalik and Abu Salih, from Ibn Abbas, by Murrah from Ibn Masood and by other companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that Adam did not have (in his grandchildren) a baby boy unless it was accompanied by a girl, so he married the male of a couple to the female of another, and the female of a couple to the male of another.</answer>

    <title>Can sujood al-sahw    be made up for later?</title>
    <question>Salam,
If you have to do sajood-as-sahw, but you forget and do not do it, is the prayer valid? Is there a way to make up for it after the prayer has finished or must the whole prayer be repeated? What if you remember when you are praying sunnah - should you break your prayer?
Jazzakallah for your help. Wa salam .</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Imaam al-Mirdaawi said in al-Insaaf (2/154): The author Ibn Qudaamah  said that two conditions apply for sujood to be made up later: It should be in the mosque A long time should not have passed. This is the right opinion, as he stated. Imaam Ahmad said: He should do the sujood if the time that has passed is short, even if he has left the mosque. He also said: He should do the sujood even if the time that has passed is long, or he has spoken or left the mosque. This is the opinion favoured by Shaykh al-Islam [Ibn Taymiyah]. Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 94. In Al-Rawd al-Murbi Sharh Zaad al-Mustaqna (2/461) it says: (If he forgets), i.e., he forgets to do the sujood al-sahw which should be done before the salaam, (and he says salaam), then he remembers, (he should do the sujood) and it is obligatory (if the time that has passed is short) If he has said salaam  and if a long time has passed according to what is ordinarily regarded as a long time, or he broke his wudoo, or he left the mosque  he does not need to do the sujood, and his prayer is still valid. In Al-Sharh al-Mumti by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen (3/537), it says: The phrase If he forgets and says salaam, he should still do the sujood if the time that has passed is short refers to the sujood that should be done before the salaam, when he has already said the salaam. He should do this sujood if the time that has passed is short, otherwise he no longer has to do it, and his prayer is still valid. Examples: A man may forget the first tashahhud, so he has to do sujood al-sahw before the salaam, but he forgets and says the salaam. If he remembers shortly afterwards, he should do the sujood, but if he remembers a long time afterwards, he no longer has to do it. This is why he said He should do sujood if only a short time has passed. If he has left the mosque, he should not come back to do this sujood  he no longer has to do it, which is unlike when he has said salaam before completing the prayer. In the latter case, he should come back and complete it, because he has omitted an obligatory act. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: Indeed, he should do the sujood, even if a long time has passed, because this will make up for what was missing. So when he remembers it, he should make up for it. But the most likely opinion is that suggested by the author (may Allaah have mercy on him), which is that if a long time has passed, the person no longer has to do the sujood, because sujood al-sahw is obligatory (waajib) either to make the prayer valid or it is waajib in the prayer as part of the prayer, so it is connected to the prayer and is not a separate prayer. We say that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever sleeps and misses the prayer, as soon as he remembers, let him pray. (Reported by al-Bukhaari (597) and Muslim (684) from the hadeeth of Anas). But we cannot use this evidence with regard to sujood al-sahw, because it is part of something else. If a person remembers soon afterwards, he should do it, otherwise he does not have to do it. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

wassalamu alaikum</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.wa alaikum us-salaam wa-rahmat ullaahi wa-barakaatuh It is permissible for women to pray in congregation among themselves. Their leader should stand in the middle of the row according to the narration regarding Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) which indicates that she used to lead women in prayer and would stand with them in the middle of the row. This has been narrated by Abdur Razzaq in Al-Musannaf 3/141 and Daraqutni 1/404, and is authentic due to evidences for it. Similarly Umm Al-Hasan narrated that she saw Umm Salmah (may Allaah be pleased with her) leading women in prayer while she stood in the middle of their row. This has been narrated by Ibn Abee Shaybah 2/88 and is also authentic due to other supporting evidences. Ibn Qudamah has quoted the difference of opinion on whether congregation for women is recommended, and then says about their leader: The one who leads them should stand in the middle of the row. We do not know of a difference of opinion on this among those who support that one women may lead others in congregation. Since it is recommended for the women to be covered, .. standing in the middle of the row makes it a better covering for her from the sides.(Al-Mughni, 2/202) The author of Al-Muhadhdhab (4/295) says: It is sunnah that the leader of women in congregation stand in the middle of them as narrated about Aaishah and Umm Salmah that they lead women and stood in the middle of their row. For further details refer to Jaami Ahkaam Al-Nisaa by Al-Adawi (1/351). And Allaah knows what is most correct and best.</answer>

    <question>Salam
What does the number 786 mean. Please be detialed. I heard it does not mean Bimillah and I would like to know why not.. Salam</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The number 786 means 786 and nothing more! When Allah or His messenger want to teach us something, they do so in the clearest way, far from puzzles and mystery numbers. All the efforts made by some Muslims to count letters and relate them to numbers are nothing but a waste of time. Sometimes they do so with good intention to show that our deen is great. Indeed our deen is great, and not in need of such erroneous approaches.</answer>

    <title>Types of make-up that affect wudoo and ghusl</title>
    <question>I have been told that a woman cannot put nailpolish because the wadoo is not done with it. How far is this true. Can she wear nailpolish (or any sort of makeup and perfo9rm her wadoo and salat.)</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. Some powders and cosmetics that are used as makeup form a insulating layer over the skin and prevent water from reaching it, while others do not prevent water from reaching the skin. If a cosmetic item insulates the skin (e.g., nailpolish as asked in the question) then it is not permissible to perform wudoo' or ghusl over it, for any act of worship that requires wudoo or ghusl (such as prayer, etc.). Allaah the most glorified and Almighty says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;O you who believe! When you prepare for prayer, wash your faces and hands .&quot; Al-Maa'idah (5:6) Washing implies that water must actually reach the part of the body being washed. Based on this observation, anything that prevents water from reaching the skin must be removed, otherwise purification will not be achieved, resulting in the prayer being void. If the cosmetic item does not insulate the skin and does not prevent water from reaching it (e.g., dying by henna or similar things which do not insulate the skin), then wudoo' or ghusl may be performed with it. Hence, dyes are of two type: the first is that which is waterproof, such as nailpolish, which must be removed before performing wudoo' or ghusl. The second is that which does not form an impermeable barrier to water, such as henna dye, and hence does not hurt the wudoo or ghusl. And Allah the most glorified and Almighty knows what is most correct and best. References: Al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam Al-Marah, Abdul Karim Zaidan, 1/84-85.

    <title>Advising one who does not pray</title>
    <question>I've a friend who likes to pray five times a day, and he likes to advise others to pray. He'll listen to whatever I talk about Islam. Whenever I approach him he'll listen to me and I tell him, why can't you pray? He told me he will, and I have heard this for the past ten to twenty years. One day I call him to pray and he gives excuses. I think that during prayer time his mind goes somewhere else; after that he thinks &quot;why can't I pray?&quot;. I am very tired of telling him. I need advice.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. If your friend is mentally sound, then all you have mentioned about him indicates his disrespect of prayers. If he means what he says, then he would perform his prayers. His claim that he likes prayers is not truthful; if it were, then he would perform them accordingly. In fact, the following verse from the Holy Qur'aan applies to such a recalcitrant and unobservant person (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Then there has succeeded them a posterity who have neglected and lost the prayers, and followed their lusts; thus, they will face devastation (on the Day of Judgment, i.e., he will face Hell).&quot; Surat Maryam 19:59. By completely ceasing to perform prayers, a person is judged to be a kaafir, based on several ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace be upon him), one of which is: &quot;The obligation and pact between us and them (the munaafiqeen, the hypocrites) is the prayer, so whoever abandons it has indeed committed kufr (i.e., become a kaafir, a non-believer).&quot; (Tirmidhi, hadeeth #2621, and it is sahih) The meaning here is that the hypocrites are guaranteed their security and immunity from being fought by the Muslims as long as they perform their prayers; if they abandon their prayers, then they are among the kuffaar, and are subject to being fought and killed in the war against them. The Prophet further says, &quot;What is between a person and committing shirk (associating partners with Allaah) and kufr (disbelief) is abandoning the prayer.&quot; (Sahih Muslim, #82) The man in question, accordingly, is to be shunned--no one should eat the meat he slaughters; he is not to marry a Muslimah; he is not to inherit a Muslim relative; he is not allowed to enter Mecca; upon dying he is not entitled to Muslim burial rites such as the washing of the body or the shrouding or the funeral prayer; and his inheritance is to go to the the community fund and not to his inheritors. Thus, it is incumbent upon you to exert as much effort as possible in advising him and admonishing him concerning the gravity and danger of his crime, and of the punishment of Allaah the Almighty. If he persists and rejects your admonition, then you would not be wrong in abstaining from your friendship with him, until you can solicit help from other friends among those who accept guidance so that you may spend your time with them inviting him to Allaah.</answer>

    <title>Sunnah (Prophet's Example) in Performing Night Prayer</title>
    <question>If a Muslim performs taraaweeh in a
   mosque, is it allowed for him to perform the night prayer at home?
   What is the Prophet's  (peace be upon him) manner in performing night prayer?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim performs Taraaweeh in congregation in the mosque, and wants to offer more prayers at home, he should pray a series of two-rak'ah prayers and should not repeat witr, because the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: &quot;There cannot be two witr prayers in one night.&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and others, and deemed saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami', 7565). Umm Salamah reported that the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to pray two rak'ahs after witr. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi and others, al-Sunan 433). Al-Nawawi said: &quot;The correct opinion is that he performed the two rak'ahs after witr sitting down, to demonstrate that this is permissible, and he did not do this all the time.&quot; (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi Sharh Jaami' al-Tirmidhi). The sunnah is to make the last of one's night prayers an odd number of rak'ahs, as is reported (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, no. 943). But if he has already prayed with the imaam, and wants to perform more prayers on his own and has time to do so - especially in the winter - he should do as is outlined above. As regards the number of rak'ahs to be performed in the night prayers, the Sunnah is to perform no more than eleven rak'ahs, because of the hadeeth narrated by 'Aa'ishah may Allaah be pleased with her, who said: &quot;. . . He never used to pray more than eleven rak'ahs, in Ramadan or at any other time . . .&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 1874). The best way to perform the night prayer is to pray two by two (rak'ahs), and to separate the two even rak'ahs of witr from the one rak'ah (i.e., not to join the three rak'ahs of witr). The evidence for this is the hadeeth of Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both), who said: &quot;The Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) used to perform the night prayers two by two (rak'ahs), then he would end with a single rak'ah.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 940). This is the best-known way of performing the night prayers according to the Sunnah of the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him); other ways are also known.</answer>

    <title>How a new Muslim should change his name</title>
    <question>I was given the name Tyrone Anthony Parker at birth by my non-muslims parents. After taking shahada, I changed my name to Bilaal Faaruwq Abdus-Salaam. I have recently found out that I shouldn't have left my family name and I plan on returning to it. If my parents tell me to return to my given name (Tyrone-has pagan origins ; Anthony-means flourishing) do I have to do it?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.For the one whom Allaah has guided to Islam, it is sufficient for him to choose an Islamic first name for himself and to keep his fathers name or surname, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not command the Sahaabah to change their fathers and grandfathers names when they embraced Islam. However, he did change the first names of those who had names with forbidden or undesirable meanings. Because your first name has pagan origins, your changing it to another name, such as Bilaal, is proper and correct. But you should keep the rest of your name and surname as it is; this will please your parents. May Allah guide them, and may He give us and you strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Using interest to pay for tuition</title>
    <question>Assalam alaikum,
The question has arisen due to many needy Muslims who are being thrown out of schools due to lack of tuition. There are many Muslims who have bank accounts which give interest, and they have not been using it as interest is haram. What should one do with the interest. Should he leave it to the bank or can it be used for such case as paying the tuition to the non Islamic institutions ?
Please give valid reasons. This question is very important and urgent as the academic term has just started and funds are not available. Jazakawallahu Kheiran,</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.and may His peace and blessings be upon His Messenger Muhammad and on his family and companions. To the honorable brother: Sheikh Ali Darani , May Allah safeguard you , Judge of Nairobi - Kenya May Allaahs peace and blessings be upon you. I have received your question by e-mail concerning the legality of spending interest money for the benefit of needy students studying in educational institutions in your country. Herein, I will summarize the answer to your question according to what scholars have mentioned: If a Muslim has earned or received unlawful money, he should get rid of it. He must neither derive any personal benefit from it, such as spending this money in eating, drinking, housing, family expenditure, educational tuition, nor can he use it in averting hardship and acts of injustice as paying compulsory insurance fees, government or sales taxes, and customs and duty charges. Indeed, the intention of its removal must be the purification of ones money from interest, and it is not considered alms giving because Allaah is pure and good and He, the Almighty, accepts only that which is pure and good. This interest money can be spent in many beneficial areas, such as for the poor and needy, for medication costs for needy people, helping mujaahideen and advocators of Islam, sustaining the impoverished and relieving debtors who can not repay their debts. Moreover, this money could be used in Islamic Center needs, such as maintaining mosques (i.e. mosque washrooms and other such facicilities), roads, etc Thus, spending this money in the tuition of needy students studying in educational institutions falls within the aforementioned possible avenues of expenditure. This is permissible even if these institutions are supervised and directed by unbelievers, on condition that the subjects areas studied are Islamically permissible and do not result in any harmful or unlawful consequences. Moreover, this interest is considered forbidden and unlawful to the one who earns it, but as for the people to whom this money given, it is permissible and lawful to make use of it, for it is considered as lost money that no one owns. Finally, may Allaah grant us success in supporting Islam and Muslims.

    <answer>Contents Related Who are the Ahlul Kitab? Are modern Christians among Ahul Kitab? Praise be to Allah.Who are the Ahlul Kitab? Ahlul Kitab (People of the Book) consist of both believers and disbelievers, as indicated in the Quran, where Allah the Almighty mentions the disbelievers among them (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;O people of the Scripture!: Why do you disbelieve in the verses [about Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)] of Allah, while you (yourselves) bear witness (to their truth).&quot; (Al Imraan, 3:70) And: &quot;Say: O people of the Scripture! Why do you stop those who believe from the path of Allah, seeking to make it crooked, while you (yourselves) are witnesses? And Allah is not unaware of what you do&quot;. (Al Imran, 3:99) And Allah, the Almighty, said about the believers among them, making clear the difference between them and the aforementioned (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Not all of them are alike; a party of the people of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the Verses of Allah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer. They believe in Allah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right and forbid evil and they hasten in good works; and they are among the righteous. And whatever good they do, nothing will be rejected of them; for Allah knows well those who are the pious.&quot; (Al Imran, 3:113-115) These people also believe in our Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and the Quran which was revealed to him as mentioned (approximate translation of meanings is): &quot;And there are, certainly, among the people of the Scripture, those who believe in Allah and in that which has been revealed to you, and in that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allah. They do not sell the Verses of Allah for a little price, for them is a reward from their Lord. Surely, Allah is swift in account.&quot; (Al Imran, 3:199) Are modern Christians among Ahul Kitab? The disbelief of the disbelieving People of the Scripture, that include Jews and Christians, in our times does not expel them from being People of the Scripture. So, the rules and regulations related to them regarding permissibility of eating their food and marrying their chaste women, in the Quran and Sunnah, are still applicable to them.

    <title>Tahiyat al-Masjid    at times when prayer is not allowed</title>
    <question>If a person enters the Masjid during one of the time when making prayer is makrooh (eg. sunrise, sunset, zawaal,...), does he still have to pray two rakaa Tahiyat Al-masjid.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There are differences among the scholars concerning this matter. The correct opinion is that Tahiyat al-masjid is permitted at all times, even after Fajr and after Asr, because of the general applicability of the hadeeth When any one of you enters the Mosque, he should not sit down until he has prayed two rakahs (Saheeh  agreed upon), and because this is one of the prayers that is done for a specific reason, like Salaat al-Tawaaf (prayer done after circumambulating the Kabah) and Salaat al-Kusoof (prayer at the time of an eclipse). The correct view concerning all of these is that it is permissible to do these at times when prayer is generally disallowed, like making up missed prayers. Concerning Salaat al-Tawaaf, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: O Banu Abd Manaaf, do not prevent anyone from circumambulating this House and praying at any time of night or day. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and the authors of Sunan with a saheeh isnaad); concerning Salaat al-Kusoof, he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The sun and moon are two of the Signs of Allaah; they are not eclipsed because of the death or life of anyone.

    <title>Rules of Erth (Inheritance)</title>
    <question>Can somebody please let me know the Rules in Islam about the State and Inheritance. My father is died and he left four sons, three daughters and my mother is alive.
Jazakallahulkhairun.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. The division of the inheritance in the case you mention is as follows: An eighth of it is due to the wife, since the father had children, as indicated in the verse (intrepretation of the meaning): &quot;And if you have children, then to them (the wives) is due an eighth of what you have left behind, after [paying] any amount specified in the will or any loans due.&quot; (surat al-Nisaa':12). The remaining seven-eighths (7/8) is divided into 11 equal portions. Each male among his children is entitled to two portions and each female one portion, as per Allaah's specification (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Allaah has enjoined upon you with regards to your children that the [entitlement of] the male is twice that of the female.&quot; (al-Nisaa':11). For example, let's suppose the man in question left property and wealth with a total worth of $88,000, and he does not owe payment on any loans and did not specify any special requests or instructions to make particular donations in his will. Thus, the division would be as follows: For the wife, an eighth, 1/8 of 88,000 which is $11,000. The remaining 77,000 is divided into 11 equal portions, 1/11 * 77,000 = $7,000 So each son is entitled to two portions, or 2 * 7,000 = $14,000 And each daughter is entitled to $7,000.</answer>

    <title>Duaas (prayers) at times of distress</title>
    <question>What does a person say when he is in times of distress?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Imaam Ahmad reported from Abdullah ibn Masood, may Allaah be pleased with him: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;There is no slave who, when he is stricken by anxiety and sorrow, says O Allaah, I am Your slave and the son of Your male slave and female slave. My forelock is in Your hand (i.e., You have complete mastery over me), Your command over me is forever executed, and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Quraan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety - but Allaah will remove his sorrow and replace his grief with joy.&quot; The people said: &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, we should learn these words.&quot; He said: &quot;The one hears them should learn them.&quot; Ibn Abbaas reported that at times of distress, the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to say: &quot;There is no god but Allaah, the All-Great, the Patient; there is no god but Allaah, Lord of the Mighty Throne; there is no god but Allaah, the Lord of heaven, the Lord of earth, and the Lord of the Noble Throne.&quot; (reported by al-Bukhaari, may Allaah have mercy on him, no. 5870). The Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;The prayer for one stricken by distress is: &quot;O Allaah, it is Your mercy that I hope for, so do not leave me in charge of my affairs even for a blink of an eye, and rectify for me all of my affairs. None has the right to be worshipped except You.&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad in al-Musnad, Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Adab, Baab maa yaqool idhaa asbaha; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 3388). Asmaa bint Umays said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said to me: Shall I not teach you some words to say at times of distress? &quot;O Allaah, You are my Lord and I do not associate anything with You.&quot;&quot; (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-salaat, Baab fil-istighfaar; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 2623). The Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said to his companions: &quot;Shall I not tell you some words which, if distress or grief befalls any of you and he offers this prayer (supplication), it will bring him joy? It is the duaa of Dhool-Noon (i.e. Yunus or Jonah): There is no god but You, Glory to You; verily I was one of the wrongdoers.&quot; (Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 2605). Anas ibn Maalik said: &quot;Whenever something distressed him, the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to say: O Ever-Living, O Self-Sustaining, by Your mercy I seek Your help.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 3446).

    <title>Is Intimacy during Iddah Allowed?</title>
    <question>Is it permitted to have intercourse with one's wife during the iddah of divorce?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.If a man has divorced his wife for the first or second time, she spends her iddah (waiting period) in his house and stays with him because she is still his wife and under his guardianship. If he wants to have intercourse with her, then according to some scholars if he does so at that time (i.e. the time of iddah), this means that he has taken her back and her iddah is over. Other scholars say that he should say words that indicate that he has taken her back (e.g., &quot;I take you back&quot; or &quot;I take so-and-so back&quot;) before he has intercourse with her, and that there should be two Muslim witnesses to these words. This puts an end to the iddah , and he may then have intercourse with her whenever he wishes. The second opinion is the soundest course to take if he wishes to have intercourse with her. But in the case of the third divorce, she does not stay with him during her iddah. She leaves his house and is no longer permissible for him (i.e. he cannot have intercourse with her) unless she has married another man; if he divorces her, then she is permitted to return to her first husband in a new marriage.

    <question>Assalam O Alikium My mother is planning to go to ummrah inshallah. But she needs a mairram and her husband nor her brothers are able to go. We have asked an alm he said she can go with her brother in-law which is also her first cousin. As long as his wife is there which she will be cause she's going too. Is this permissable in Islam because I still have my doubts. Jazak allah ho karun.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.One of the ways in which Islam protects women is that it requires a woman to travel with a mahram, to protect her from those who have bad intentions and to help her, because of her weakness, in facing the arduous trials of travelling. A woman is not permitted to travel without a mahram because of the hadeeth narrated by Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: A woman should absolutely not travel unless she has a mahram with her. A man stood up and said, O Messenger of Allaah, I have enlisted in such-and-such a military campaign, and my wife has set out for Hajj. He said, Go and do Hajj with your wife. (al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 3006). What indicates that a mahram is obligatory is the fact that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded this man to give up the idea of jihaad (on this occasion), even though he had enlisted for a campaign and his wife was travelling for the purpose of worship, not for some frivolous or suspicious reason. In spite of all this, he told him to go and do Hajj with his wife. The ulamaa have listed five conditions for a person to be considered a mahram. He should be male, Muslim, adult, and of sound mind, and he should be a relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden, such as a father, brother, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, father in law, mothers husband or brother through radaaah (breastfeeding), etc. (as opposed to relatives to whom marriage is temporarily forbidden, such as a sisters husband, paternal aunts husband, maternal aunts husband). On this basis, the husbands brother and the son of a paternal or maternal uncle are not mahrams, so it is not permitted for her to travel with them. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Maximum period for post-childbirth bleeding</title>
    <question>My About Taharah for women after childbirth. My wife kept bleeding after our child birth for exactly 56 days that is 16 days more than usual. Could you give us details about what she should consider those extra 16 days. some says that it might be her period (Dawrah ), some said it is estihathah. other said it is a collection of Dawrah and estihathah. We have Sheikh Mohmmed bin Saleh Al-Othaimeen book &quot; Al-dema'a Al-tabeeiyah&quot;, but we did not realy understand exactly what he means.How do we know that it is her periond or it is not?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There is a dispute amongst the religious scholars regarding the longest period of nifaas (the post-natal bleeding period). Some scholars say it is forty (40) days, others say it is sixty (60) days and some say there is no limit to the maximum number of days a woman can be a in a state of nifaas. The most predominate opinion is that the maximum period is forty (40) days according to what is narrated by Umm Salama. Umm Salama said &quot;The nufasaa' (a woman in a state of birth blood discharge) used to continue to be in childbed for forty days at the time of the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him.&quot; Al-Tirmidhi reported: &quot;It is unanimously agreed upon among religious scholars from the sahaabah (companions of the Prophet , peace and blessings be upon him) and al-taabi'oon (those who had met only a companion of the Prophet , but not the Prophet himself) that the nufasaa' does not pray for forty days unless she sees tuhr (blood stoppage) before the end of the forty days period. She should then perform ghusl (ablution of the whole body) and she resumes praying. The majority of the religious scholars say that a woman does pray even If she continues to notice blood after the forty days period expires and this is the opinion of the majority of fuqahaa' (religious scholars) among whom Sufian Al-Thawry, Ibn Al-Mubarak, Al-Shafi'i, Ahmad and Ishaaq.&quot; Sunan Al-Tirmidhi hadeeth # 139. The same hadeeth is also reported by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood, Ibn Majah and Al-Daraami and is classified as hasan by Al-Albaani in Irwaa' Al-Ghaleel # 201. Al-Albaani has supported this narration by another hadeeth reported by Abu Dawood narrated by Umm Salama who said, &quot;A Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) wife used to remain in (a state of) nifaas for forty nights and the Prophet would not ask her to make up the prayers she missed during the period of nifaas&quot;. Ibn Majah also reported that Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him, narrated that &quot;The Prophet had specified a period of forty days for the nufasaa' unless she achieves tuhr before that.&quot; Irwaa' Al Ghaleel # 223-222/1. Therefore, if a woman experiencing post-childbirth bleeding spent forty days and she still sees blood, then we consider this blood as istihaadha (womb bleeding between periods) which does not stop a woman from performing prayer (salaat) nor fasting (siyaam), unless the end of the forty days coincides with the regular menstrual period (dawrah); in this case she would consider this blood as menstrual blood. Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on playing cards</title>
    <question>My I have read in another Islamic website that you shouldn't play cards even if you aren't gambling. If this is true, I don't understand why, if you are just playing for the fun of it. If you would please explain. Jazaka Allah Khairan.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The reasons are: Wasting of time in something which has no benefit in this life nor in the hereafter. This game of cards is based on the idea of gambling, and it resembles playing with dice, which is clearly prohibited in Islaam, as related in the authentic hadeeth of the Prophet : &quot;Whoever plays with dice, would (resemble) one who has tainted his hand with the flesh and blood of a pig,&quot; narrated by Muslim (2260). The playing cards include pictures of creations with a soul (the Jack and Queen ). The rancor, enmity, bitterness, and/or ill-feeling which may occur between the players (shahnaa' wa-baghdaa'). The game promotes cheating, deception, and trickery (ghish wa-tahaayul). It distracts from the worship of Allaah, and from salaat. Even if one performs salaat on time, and with the congregation in the Masjid, how would he escape the hadeeth of the Prophet : &quot;Everything other than remembering Allah is (considered) wasteful play except four: a man humoring his wife, a man training his horse, a man walking between targets (learning archery), and man learning swimming,&quot; narrated by An-Nasaa'i and authenticated by Al-Albaani (Sahih Al-Jami' 4534).</answer>

    <title>A Muslim treatment of mother who is an unbeliever</title>
    <question>My wife's mother has in effect cut herself off from her daughter in recent times. Whilst there was some form of communication it was often quite turbulent and heated. My wife has tried a number of times to re-establish contact yet her mother refuses, quite stubbornly, to reply. We are both reverts and have often felt that our acceptance of the religion has played some part in her mother's negative attitude. I would be grateful if you could advise us on what me might possibly do to rectify this situation.
Jazak Allahu Khairan</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah., The reactions of non-muslim mothers towards their children's embracement of Islam varies. Some mothers are peaceful and passive considering this as a personal matter which does not affect the relationship between the mother and her son or daughter. In such cases more piety by the child towards his or her mother will make the mother admire and respect Islam. Other mothers adopts a more stubborn approach at the beginning but the mother finally gives in and accepts the new religion as a fact of life after she sees the child's determination and persistence which could lead the mother herself to embrace Islam. In the third case we find that some mothers are constantly stubborn to the extent that she might hurt and oppress her son or daughter. Usually such mothers are blindly prejudice because they consider that her son or daughter had gone astray by leaving the faith of his fathers and ancestors and she must do something to help go back to the right path (according to the mother). The following are three stories that took place at the time of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, that involved three of the Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him) which illustrates the reactions of their mothers after they embraced Islam: Story #1 On the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said &quot;My mother came to visit me one day. At that time she was still a polytheist and there was a pledge between the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, and Quraish (one of the great tribes in Arabia that lived in Mecca in the pre Islamic Period of Ignorance who used to enjoy great spiritual and financial powers). I requested the Prophet's, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, religious verdict and said: Oh Prophet of Allah, my mother came to visit me, seeking my help; should I keep a good relationship with her? Yes, keep a good relation with her said the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him:. Reported by Bukhari and Muslim, and this narration is listed in Sahih Muslim under # 1003. In another version narrated by Ahmad, on the authority of Asmaa' Bint Abi Bakr she said &quot; My mother came to visit me when she was still a polytheist and she was living amongst Quraish. She was desirous, meaning in need, so I asked the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, and said: Oh Prophet of Allah my mother came to me and she is a polytheist and she needs help. Should I keep a good relationship with her? He said yes maintain a good relationship with her. Story #2 On the authority of Abu-Huraira, who said: I used to call my mother to Islam when she was still a polytheist. One day, while I was calling her she mentioned something about the Prophet , Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, that I detested. So I went to see the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, while crying and told him: I used to call my mother to Islam and she would refuse. I called her today and she mentioned something about you that I detested. Please invoke the blessings and guidance of Allah on her. Then the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, said: O Great Allah guide the mother of Abu-Huraira. So I left full of hope because of the Prophet's supplication for my mother. When I reached home I found that the door was partially closed. My mother heard my footsteps and said: Stay still Abu-Huraira, then I heard the water running; he added my mother performed body ablution, put on her cloths and hurriedly opened the door without her head-cover and said: &quot;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, is the Messenger of Allah&quot;. I went back to the Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, crying of joy and told him: I am bringing you good news; Allah answered your prayers and guided the mother of Abu-Huraira. The Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, praised and glorified Allah and said: this is good. I said: Oh Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to make me and my mother beloved by Allah's believing slaves and make us love them. The Prophet, Peace and Blessings be Upon Him, said: Oh Allah, make this little slave of Yours and his mother (meaning Abu-Huraira and his mother) become beloved by your believing slaves and make the believers love them. Ever since, there was not a believer who heard of me, even without seeing me, that did not love me. Reported by Muslim in Sahih Muslim (Muslim Authentic volumes) under # 2491. Story # 3 On the authority of Saa'd (Ibn Abi Waqas May Allah be pleased with him) who said that verses of the Qur'an revealed his story. He said Um Saa'd (his mother) swore not to talk to him ever nor eat or drink until he renounces Islam. She said: You claim that Allah commanded you to obey your parents. I am your mother and I order you to do this ( to renounce Islam). He said: She stayed with nothing to eat or drink for three days until she fainted because of strain. Then one of her other sons named Umarah gave her water to drink. And she started to imprecate against Saa'd, then Allah revealed this verse in the Qur'an, which translates to the meaning of And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what you used to do Verse 29:8 - Surah 29, Al Ankabut. This Hadith is narrated by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad and in Sahih Muslim in his Sahih under # 1748. Also, Allah revealed another verse in the Qur'an, which translates to: &quot;But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that if which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do&quot;( 31:15 - Surah Luqman). Based on the above stories one can determine how to deal with a non believing mother and can draw the following significant conclusions: The importance of good presentation of Islam to the non believing mother and to try to kindly persuade her and to strive to convince her as Abu Huraira did (story # 1) Continue to do good to the non believing mother and to remember that her disbelief does not justify disobedience by the son or daughter and that doing her good does not contradict with your innocence of her as a non believer, on the contrary as it is stated in Verse 31:15 above, Allah has commanded us to treat the non believing parents kindly even if they strive to make their child a polytheist because of their rights as parents hoping that they will embrace Islam. Continue to sincerely pray and supplicate for the non believing mother hoping that Allah may guide her, as evident in Abu Huraira's story (story #2). The divine guidance of Allah may come after continuous strive by the child and strong objection of the mother as in Abu Huraira's story, therefore the son should never surrender or give up but should continue to pray and supplicate for the non believing mother. Regardless of how hard does the non believing mother strive to make the son renounces Islam, and the pressure she will exercise against her son such as refusing to eat or invoking upon him , the son should never surrender or give in nor should he retrocede away from the righteous path as one of the Sahaba said to his non believing mother in a similar situation: :If you had one hundred (100) souls and it all left your body one after the other I will never give up my religion (Islam)&quot;. It seems that the mother in question deliberately oppresses her daughter through estrangement which makes her emotional torn but that should never weaken the muslim or shake his faith and belief in his religion. There is no objection to make the non believing mother understand that you are not going to retrocede , however she (the mother) can kindly ask for anything and she will be immediately answered to it except for giving up this religion. We ask Allah to quickly guide her to the righteous path and give you patience to call her to Islam and lead you to the righteous and correct way.</answer>

    <title>Difference Between Punishments and Trials</title>
    <question>Allah mentions in the Quran that when an evil befalls us it is due to what our own hands have earned. Also our beloved Messenger, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said in a hadeeth (report) that the most tried are the Prophets, then those in piety after those. So therefore in our day to day life when things go wrong in our lives, how do we decide whether it is due to our sinfulness or that Allah loves us and therefore sends a trial upon us?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Punishments are what happen to people in return for their evil deeds. Trials are tests which are sent to try people, and people may be tested by good things or by bad. Concerning punishments, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself [al-Nisa 4:79] Concerning the phrase is from yourself, Qatadah said: [It means] the punishment is for you, O son of Adam, because of your sin. Abu Salih said that whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself means because of your sin, and I [Allah] am the One Who decreed it for you. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). Allah also says (interpretation of the meaning): And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much. [al-Shoora 42:30] Ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said: [It means] whatever misfortune happens to you, O people, is because of evil deeds that you have already done, and He pardons much refers to evil deeds  He does not punish you for them but He pardons them. And if Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, he would not leave a moving (living) creature on the surface of the earth [Fatir 35:45  interpretation of the meaning]. Concerning trials, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: If Allah loves a people, He tries them, and whoever has patience will have patience, and whoever is anxious will be anxious. (Reported by al-Imam Ahmad; Saheeh al-Jami, 1706). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: The extent of the reward will be in accordance with the extent of the trial. If Allah loves a people, He tries them, and whoever is content will have contentment, and whoever is angry will have anger. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2320; Saheeh al-Jami, 2210). The following outlines how one may tell whether a given event is a punishment or a trial: If the misfortune results from doing an act of obedience to Allah, such as being wounded in jihad, or losing money when migrating for the sake of Allah, or losing a job because of becoming a Muslim or increasing ones commitment to Islam, then this is a trial. Whoever bears it with patience will be rewarded, but if one reacts angrily then one will earn the wrath of Allah. If the misfortune results from sin, such as sexually-transmitted diseases or illnesses caused by drinking alcohol and taking drugs, and so on, then this is the kind of punishment that comes in this world (as opposed to being deferred until the Hereafter). If the misfortune is connected neither to a good deed nor a sin  such as other kinds of diseases and sicknesses, losing a child, or failing in business  then it depends on the persons situation. If he is good and devout, it is a trial, and if he is sinful, it is a punishment. The misfortune may be a punishment to atone for sins, or it may be a trial aimed at raising a persons status and increasing his hasanat (good deeds/rewards)  this may be determined by whether a person is obedient or disobedient. A person should not praise himself, rather he should criticize himself for his shortcomings and strive to attain perfection. He will benefit from misfortunes in any case, if he has patience and hopes for reward. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>He is in love with a girl but    cannot marry her</title>
    <question>I am currently in a sitaution that may be common among the muslim community. I have met a wonderful Muslim XXX girl six months ago, I am XXX. We talked for many months and have become very close. Actually we are in love with each other. Everything about our relationship has been wonderful.I feel Allah has brought us together. We have talked about marriage and both agree we want to spend our lives together.Now here is where the problem begins.Her father would not agree to marry her to anyone but a XXX that he has chosen in an arranged marriage.Even if she doesnt love him. I have spoken to her mother and she really likes me.She tried to talk to her husband but he wouldnt listen.Now it looks like her dad will arrange a marriage for her soon. What can we DO!!!I dont want to lose her I love her soooo much.Is there anything we can do?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.besides Whom there is nobody to praise when calamity strikes. My dear brother, you should realize that no calamity befalls a person except because of sin, and it cannot be lifted except by repentance. Despite all the hardship you are facing and the intense pain you are feeling, you still have to think about the root of the problem and understand the shari ruling on it and learn a lesson from what has happened. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself [al-Nisa 4:79] it comes from yourself because you gave yourself free rein in starting this forbidden relationship and getting to know this girl in a manner that is not approved of in shareeah, and because you indulged in absolute freedom in an environment that is far removed from the laws of Allaah. Dont you see that our Lord is truly Wise and All-Knowing when He forbids men to deliberately look at non-mahram women or to touch them or be alone with them or take them as friends? Allaah knows that this leads to haraam things whether it is immoral actions of varying decrees or falling in love  which is the serious and fatal disease from which you are suffering because of your sin. You have become one of its victims, suffering its pain and choking on it. You have been very frank in describing this disease from its onset, and how you fell into this devilish trap, when you said in your question: I have met a wonderful Muslim girl six months ago... We talked for many months and have become very close. Actually we are in love with each other. But you mention that you feel that Allaah has led you to one another. If you mean that this has happened by the will and decree of Allaah, then this is correct. Even Iblees exists by the will and decree of Allaah. But if you meant that Allaah decreed this because He likes it and approves of it, (this is wrong, because) Allaah does not approve of anything that is haraam. Just because something happens does not mean that Allaah likes it or approves of it. Allaah decrees good and evil for reasons which only He knows. If you say now that what has happened has happened, and cannot be changed, so what can we do about this father who is standing in the way of these two lovers who want to get married? I would say that there is nothing wrong with making efforts  in halaal ways, of course  to persuade this father, such as bringing mediators from within the family, or the imaam of the Islamic Centre where the father goes, and so on, and praying earnestly to Allaah to make this girl part of your lot in life if this is good for you and for her. If what you want happens, then praise be to Allaah, Who is the Giver of bounty and blessings. But if all attempts fail, mediation does not work and the wind blows in the way that the sailor does not like (i.e., things do not go the way you hoped), then you should know that from the point of view of shareeah you can never marry this girl without the consent of her guardian  which is her father in the case  because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Any woman who gets married without the consent of her guardian, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid, her marriage is invalid. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1102, and by Abu Dawood, Ahmad and Ibn Maajah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 2709). The marriage contract will not be valid even if it was approved by jaahili courts and kaafir judges. It is impossible for running away with this girl to be a valid solution, either in this world or in the next. We must also ask some other questions raised by your situation, such as: what is your commitment to Islam  do you pray regularly, for example? Does she adhere to the hijaab prescribed by shareeah? What is the attitude of your own family to the idea of your marrying this girl? Finally, you must realize that you will have to forget about her if she marries someone else. In that case, you should not waste your life regretting losing her. You never know where good may come from. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you, and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know. [al-Baqarah 2:216] What has happened is a mistake of which you are going to bear the bitter consequences, but you have to be sincere towards Allaah and strive to repent and turn back to Him. If this girl is not destined to be your lot in life, then we ask Allaah to compensate you with someone better than her. Verily, he who fears Allaah with obedience to Him, and is patient, then surely, Allaah makes not the reward of the muhsinoon (good-doers) to be lost. [Yoosuf 12:90  interpretation of the meaning].</answer>

    <title>Is Masturbation Haram in Islam?</title>
    <question>I have a question which I am shy to ask but another sister who has come to Islam recently wants an answer to and I do not have an answer (with evidence from the Quran and Sunnah). I hope you can help and I hope Allah will forgive me if it is inappropriate but as Muslims we should never be shy in seeking knowledge. Her question was &quot;Is it permissible in Islam to masturbate?&quot;
May Allah increase us all in knowledge!</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Is masturbation haram in Islam? Prohibition of masturbation in the Quran Prohibition of masturbation in the Sunnah Tips on how to give up masturbation Praise be to Allah. Is masturbation haram in Islam? Masturbation (for both men and women) is haraam (forbidden) in Islam based on the following evidence: Prohibition of masturbation in the Quran Al-Imam Shafi'i stated that masturbation is forbidden based on the following verses from the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): {And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts). Except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors.} (Al-Muminun 23:5-7) Here the verses are clear in forbidding all illegal sexual acts (including masturbation) except for the wives or what their right hand possesses. {And whoever seeks beyond that is the transgressor.} Some scholars used as evidence the ayah (in meaning), {And let those who find not the financial means for marriage keep themselves chaste, until Allah enriches them of His bounty.} (Al-Nur 24:33) This verse also clearly orders whoever does not have the financial means to marry to keep himself chaste and be patient in facing temptations (including masturbation) until Allah enriches them of His bounty. Prohibition of masturbation in the Sunnah 'Abdullaah ibn Masud said, &quot;We were with the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) while we were young and had no wealth whatsoever. Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said, 'O young people! Whoever among you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. his private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.'&quot; (Al-Bukhari 5066) The hadeeth orders men who are not able to marry to fast despite the hardship encountered in doing so, and not to masturbate despite the ease with which it can be done. There is additional evidence that can be cited to support this ruling on masturbation, but due to the limited space we will not go through them here. Tips on how to give up masturbation As for curing/treating the habit of masturbation, we recommend the following suggestions: 1. The motive to seek a cure for this problem should be solely following Allah's orders and fearing His punishment. 2. A permanent and quick cure from this problem lies in marriage as soon as the person is able, as shown in the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) hadeeth. 3. Keeping oneself busy with what is good for this world and the Hereafter is essential in breaking this habit before it becomes second nature after which it is very difficult to rid oneself of it. 4. Lowering the gaze (from looking at forbidden things such as pictures, movies etc.) will help suppress the desire before it leads one to commit the haram (forbidden). Allah orders men and women to lower their gaze as shown in the following two verses and in the Prophet's hadith. {Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.). That is purer for them. Verily, Allah is all-aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.) ..... } (24: 30-31) Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;Do not follow a casual (unintentional) look (at forbidden things) with another look.&quot; (Al-Tirmidhi, 2777) This is a general instruction by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) to abstain from all that may sexually excite a person because it might lead him/her to commit the haram (forbidden). 5. Using one's available leisure time in worshipping Allah and increasing religious knowledge. 6. Being cautious not to develop any of the medical symptoms that may result from masturbation such as weak eyesight, weak nervous system, and/or back pain. More importantly, feelings of guilt and anxiety that can be complicated by missing obligatory prayers because of the need to shower (ghusl) after every incidence of masturbation, especially in the winter, and the invalidating of the fast. 7. Avoiding the illusion that some youth have that masturbation is permissible because it prevents them from committing illegal sexual acts such as fornication or even homosexuality, while they may not be at the gates of that immorality to begin with. 8. Strengthening one's willpower and not surrendering to the shaytan, and avoiding spending time alone as recommended by the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) when he said &quot;Do not spend the night alone&quot; Ahmad, 6919. 9. Following the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) aforementioned hadeeth and fasting when possible, because fasting will temper one's sexual desire and keep it under control. However, one should not overreact and swear by Allah not to return to the act because if one does not honor one's promise, one would be facing the consequences of not living up to one's oath to Allah. Also, note that medication to diminish one's sexual desire is strictly prohibited because it might permanently affect one's sexual ability. 10. Trying to follow the Prophet's (peace and blessings be upon him) recommendation concerning the etiquette of getting ready for bed, such as reading the well-known supplications, sleeping on the right side, and avoiding sleeping on the belly (the Prophet-peace and blessings be upon him- forbade sleeping on the belly). 11. Striving hard to be patient and chaste, because persistence will eventually, Allah willing, lead to attaining those qualities as second nature, as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) explains in the following hadith: &quot;Whoever seeks chastity Allah will make him chaste, and whoever seeks help from none but Allah, He will help him, and whoever is patient He will make it easy for him, and no one has ever been given anything better than patience.&quot; Al-Bukhari:1469. 12. If one falls into this sin, they must hasten to repent, asking forgiveness from Allah, doing good deeds, and not losing hope and feeling despair; these are all prerequisites to curing this problem. Note that losing hope is one of the major sins punishable by Allah. 13. Finally, Allah is the Most Merciful and He always responds to whoever calls on Him. So, asking for Allah's forgiveness and help will be accepted, by His will.

    <title>Children's Education</title>
    <question>Asalaamulaikum respected brother,
Insha'Allah, you may be able to help me answer these questions for a friend of mine.
What is Islam's view on the parents' (especially the father's) responsibility to educate their children? Additionally, what type or manner of education is most Islamically correct (i.e. private or public school etc.)?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. Praise be to Allaah. No doubt that a child's education is one of life's necessities, and as such spending to achieve it is obligatory on the parents. However, the level of education that a Muslim should provide for his children is not necessarily the highest level possible. This is because a child can lead a perfectly normal life with only, for example, high school education. And as for whether private schools are better than public schools from the shari'ah (Islamic jurisprudence) standpoint, I do not think that there is a general rule by which we can favor one schooling system over the other. It all depends on the specifics of each individual case when assessed with respect to curricula, teachers' skills, and the school district credibility. Wallaahu a'lam. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Praying in a moving vehicle</title>
    <question>As Salam Wahalakum,
Can we pray salat while in a moving car that's because there
is no place to stop and pray?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah. Performing prayers at the right time is a trust and an obligation, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Verily, al-Salaat (the prayer) is enjoined on the believers at fixed hours.&quot; [al-Nisaa' 4:103]. Delaying the prayer past its appointed time is a grave major sin, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;So woe unto those performers of salaat (prayers) (hypocrites), who delay their salaat from their stated fixed times.&quot; [al-Maa'oon 107:4-5] Some scholars state that the person who deliberately misses one prayer and leaves it until the appointed time is over, with no excuse, is a kaafir. Claiming that one cannot find a place to pray is not a valid excuse, because either one is living on the face of the earth or not, and if one is living on the face of the earth, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;The (whole) earth has been made a mosque (or a place of prayer) and a means of purification for me, so wherever a man of my ummah may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 335) According to a report narrated by Muslim, he said: &quot;The (whole) earth has been made good for me, a means of purification and a mosque (or place of prayer); so wherever a man may be when the time for prayer comes, let him pray wherever he is.&quot; (Saheeh Muslim, no. 521) The entire world is a suitable place to prostrate oneself; the scholars have made no exceptions except very few, such as graveyards and lavatories. Wherever a Muslim is when the time for prayer comes, he should pray: in a mosque, if possible, or else in a hallway or park, on a sidewalk or in a parking lot, or in a corner of a store. Even if one can find no other place than a church, it is permissible to pray in it. As far as praying on board means of transportation is concerned, then it is possible to pray there so long as the necessary conditions of prayer are fulfilled, or else one can wait until one gets out of the vehicle. If waiting means that the time for the prayer will pass, then you should pray in the best way that you can. Let us assume, for example, that you are in a car or train where there is no place to pray, you cannot stop and pray at the side of the road, and the time for that prayer is running out. In such a situation, the Muslim should pray in the best way that he can, even if he is sitting in his seat and even if he is not facing the qiblah, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can&quot; [al-Taghaabun 64:16], and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;If I have commanded you to do something, do as much of it as you can.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 7288) An exception to be above is naafil (supererogatory) prayers offered when riding a camel, which is permissible even if one cannot get down or if one is not facing the qiblah. This is known from the report of Ibn 'Umar, who said: &quot;The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray when travelling on his camel, no matter which direction it was facing, and he would gesture with his head to indicate the movements of the night prayer, apart from the obligatory prayers, and he would pray witr on his camel too.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 945) Ibn 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to pray voluntary (nafl) prayers when riding on his camel, no matter what direction it was facing, when he came from Makkah to Madeenah.&quot; Then Ibn 'Umar recited this aayah (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And to Allaah belong the east and the west, so wherever you turn yourselves or your faces, there is the Face of Allaah (and He is High above, over His Throne)&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:115] Ibn 'Umar said: &quot;It was concerning this that this aayah was revealed.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2883; he said, this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth) We should not forget to point out here that Muslims living in non-Muslim countries sometimes delay or abandon their prayers for another, completely different, reason, which is that they feel too embarrassed to pray in front of the kuffaar in public or open places, or they are afraid that they will make fun of them and regard them as odd. This is a serious mistake. How can a Muslim feel embarrassed about proclaiming the truth and worshipping openly, hastening to fulfil the command of Allaah at the time when Allaah has said it is to be done? This matter has been dealt with in a similar question on this website (see question # 980). We ask Allaah to help us all to remember Him, to be grateful to Him and to worship Him properly.</answer>

    <title>Why Do Muslims Shave Babies Heads?</title>
    <question>Is the act of shaving a newborn baby's head rooted in Islam? What is the purpose of doing this, and is it referenced in the Quran?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.Shaving the newborns head is Sunnah on the seventh day from his birth. Samurah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;A child is held in pledge for his Aqqah which should be slaughtered on his behalf on the seventh day after his birth, and he should be given a name, and his head should be shaved.&quot; (Ibn Majah) Salman ibn Amir narrated that Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah upon him) said: &quot;For a boy, there is an 'Aqiqah. So spill blood for him and remove the harm from him.&quot; (Ahmad) He said that Ibn Sireen used to say if removing harm from him did not mean shaving the head, then I don't know what it is. Ibn Al-Qayyim (Allah's mercy upon him) said about the benefit of shaving the newborn's hair : Shaving his head removes the harm from him, removes the weak hair so that stronger and firmer hair replaces it and it is beneficial for the head. In addition, it comforts the newborn and opens the head's skin openings... And along with this is a strengthening of his eyesight, his sense of smell and hearing. (Ahkam al-Tifl by Ahmad Al-Isawi 192) Sheikh Ibn Uthaimin said: It appears that shaving the head on that day has a positive effect on the hair roots. (Al-Sharh Al-Mumti` 7/540) And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Children's Character</title>
    <question>Many people are concerned about their childrens unstable characters and the effects of luxury on their personalities. How can we introduce strength and honour into our childrens characters?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The issue referred to in the question is one of the most serious problems in raising children nowadays. Some of the Islamic solutions to this problem and ways of instilling strength and honour in our childrens character are listed below:Takniyyah (using the kunya or patronymic in addressing children) Calling a young boy &quot;Abu Foolaan&quot; (&quot;Father of so-and-so) or a young girl &quot;Umm Foolaan&quot; (&quot;Mother of so-and-so&quot;) will make the child feel more responsible and grown up, so he will become more mature and will feel above normal childishness. The Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to give kunyas to children. Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was the best of people in attitude and manners. I had a brother whom people used to call Abu Umayr. I think he was just past the age of weaning, and whenever he came along the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) would say to him, O Abu Umayr, what did the nughayr do (Ya Abaa Umayr ma faala al-nuhgayr)?&quot; (The nughayr was a small bird with which he used to play). (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5735). Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid reported that the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was given some clothes, among which was a small black garment made of silk, known as a khameesah. He said, &quot;Who do you think I should give this to?&quot; The people were silent, then he said, &quot;Bring me Umm Khaalid&quot; and she was carried to him (which indicates that she was very young). He picked up the garment and put it on her, saying, &quot;Enjoy it until it wears out.&quot; There was a green or yellow spot on it, and he said, &quot;O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaah&quot; sanaah means &quot;beautiful&quot; in Ethiopian. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5375). According to another report also narrated by al-Bukhaari: &quot;He looked at the khameesah and pointed to it, saying, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa, O Umm Khaalid, this is sanaa.&quot; Sanaa in Ethiopian means beautiful. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5397).Taking them to gatherings and letting them sit with grown-ups This will increase their understanding and wisdom, and make them try to imitate adults, as well as keeping them from spending too much time on games and entertainment. The Sahaabah used to bring their children with them when they went and sat with the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him). One of the stories that describe this was narrated by Muaawiyah ibn Qurrah from his father, who said: &quot;The Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to sit with a group of his Companions. One man had his little son with him; he would bring him from behind and make him sit in front of him&quot; (Reported by al-Nisaai and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Ahkaam al-Janaaiz).Talking to them about the heroic deeds of earlier and subsequent generations, Islamic battles and Muslim victories This will encourage them to be brave, which is one of the most important parts of being strong and honourable. Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam had two children, one of whom was present at some of the battles, and the other of whom used to play with the old battle scars on his fathers shoulder. This was reported by Urwah ibn al-Zubayr, who said that the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said to al-Zubayr on the day of Yarmook, &quot;Will you go and attack, and we will go with you?&quot; He said, &quot;If I attacked, you would be lying.&quot; They said, &quot;No, we will do (as we promised).&quot; So he launched an attack (against the Romans), penetrating their ranks and passing straight through, but no one was with him. Then he turned around and came back, and the Romans seized the reins of his horse and wounded him twice in the shoulder. Between these two new wounds was a scar from a wound he had received at Badr. Urwah said, &quot;When I was little, I used to play by putting my fingers in those scars.&quot; Urwah said, &quot; Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr was with him on that day. He was ten years old. He (al-Zubayr) put him on a horse and entrusted him to the care of another man.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3678). Commenting on this hadeeth, Ibn Hajar (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &quot;Al-Zubayr felt that his son Abdullaah was brave and chivalrous, so he put him on a horse, but he feared that he might attempt to do more than he was able, so he put another man with him so that he could feel that he was safe from the attacks of the Romans should he become distracted by the fighting.&quot; Ibn al-Mubaarak reported from Hishaam ibn Urwah from his father from Abdullaah ibn al-Zubayr that he was with his father on the day of Yarmook, and when the mushrikoon (pagans)ran away, he attacked and started killing their wounded, i.e., he finished off every wounded soldier whom he found. This indicates that he was strong and brave from childhood.Teaching them good manners Among the manners that should be taught are those described in the hadeeth (prophetic narration) narrated by Abu Hurayrah from the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him): &quot;The young should greet the old, the passerby should greet one who is sitting, and the small group should greet the larger group.&quot; (Al-Bukhaari, 5736).Giving them the praise and respect they deserve in front of others This is made clear by the following hadeeth: Sahl ibn Sad (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was brought a cup and he drank from it. There was a boy, the youngest of all the people, on his right and some elders on his left. He said, &quot;O young boy, will you allow me to give this to these elders?&quot; The boy said, &quot;I will not give away my share of your blessings to anyone, O Messenger of Allaah,&quot; so he gave the cup to him. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 2180)Teaching them manly sports - such as archery, swimming and horse riding.Avoiding humilating them, especially in front of others Never belittling their ideas, and encouraging them to take partConsulting them and asking for their opinionsGiving them responsibilities in accordance with their age and abilitiesTeaching them to be brave as appropriate including how to speak in publicMaking sure their clothes are modest and protecting them from inappropriate clothing, hairstyles, movements and ways of walkingMaking sure that boys do not wear silk, as this is only for womenAvoiding extravagance, luxury, laziness and idleness Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;Get used to a rough life, for luxury does not last forever.&quot;Avoiding entertainment or pastime gatherings, singing, music and other wastes of time, because these go against strength, honour and seriousness These are some of the ways and means which will increase strength and honour, and protect our children. Allaah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.</answer>

    <title>Proportional representation in Islamic centers</title>
    <question>Is proportional representation in Islam alowable or not.The situation is thus, if there are say 10 Muslim organisations(each with a differant number of members) and they all join together to form one mother organisation so that they can co-ordinate between the Islamic work between each other. Is it permissible that we catogorise the organisation according to their membership. That is if one organisation has 1-100 members they get one vote, 101-200 members they get two votes and so on, Is this permissible in Islam? I hope you can answer this thank you</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. There is no problem with this because it is a way of organizing things in order to reach the right or better opinion, by using points to represent groups according to their size or number of members. But you should know that a &quot;one man one vote&quot; system may be unfair if the people involved are not equal in trustworthiness, ability, knowledge and experience that are necessary for the kind of decision-making that you want to undertake. If they are equal or close enough, then &quot;one man one vote&quot; is fair and wise. The people of authority (ahl al-hall wal-aqd) in this ummah are those who have knowledge and virtue, who are rational and wise, and who are prominent and distinguished. These, not the ignorant masses whose opinion is worthless, are the ones who select the khaleefah. May Allaah help you to do that which will please Him.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Writing down the contracts and agreements that people make among themselves is a way of confirming and formalizing them, but it is not a condition for the validity of the contract. The marriage contract may be made verbally by means of an offer on the part of the brides wali or guardian (e.g. I marry my daughter to you) and acceptance on the part of the groom (e.g. I accept). Writing it down is not a condition, but it does serve to document and confirm the contract, which is a good thing, especially nowadays. And Allaah is the source of help.</answer>

    <title>Is Taking Pictures Haram?</title>
    <question>My question is : IS the taking of PHOTOGRAPHS ALLOWED,(I know drawing pictures of living things is not allowed -but what about taking photograph's of people etc.), can you supply me with some evidence please. I need this information quickly.- Inshallah.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Photography (tasweer) means the taking of pictures of living, animate moving beings, like people, animals, birds, etc. The ruling is that it is forbidden on the basis of a number of reports, such as the following: 'Abdullaah ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Those who will be most severely punished by Allaah on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see al-Fath, 10/382). Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Allaah, may He be exalted, says: 'Who does more wrong than the one who tries to create something like My creation? Let him create a grain of wheat or a kernel of corn.'&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see Fath al-Baari, 10/385). 'Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;Shall I not send you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) sent me? Do not leave any built-up tomb without levelling it, and do not leave any picture in any house without erasing it.&quot; (Reported by Muslim and al-Nisaa'i; this is the version narrated by al-Nisaa'i). Ibn 'Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Every image-maker will be in the Fire, and for every image that he made a soul will be created for him, which will be punished in the Fire.&quot; Ibn 'Abbaas said: &quot;If you must do that, make pictures of trees and other inanimate objects.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, 3/1871) These ahaadeeth indicate that pictures of animate beings are haraam, whether they are humans or other creatures, whether they are three-dimensional or two-dimensional, whether they are printed, drawn, etched, engraved, carved, cast in moulds, etc. These ahaadeeth include all of these types of pictures. The Muslim should submit to the teachings of Islam and not argue with them by saying, &quot;But I am not worshipping them or prostrating to them!&quot; If we think about just one aspect of the evil caused by the prevalence of photographs and pictures in our times, we will understand something of the wisdom behind this prohibition: that aspect is the great corruption caused by the provoking of physical desires and subsequent spread of immorality caused by these pictures. The Muslim should not keep any pictures of animate beings in his house, because they will prevent the angels from entering. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, see al-Fath, 10/380). But nowadays, unfortunately, one can even find in some Muslim homes statues of gods worshipped by the kuffaar (such as Buddha etc.) which they keep on the basis that they are antiques or decorative pieces. These things are more strictly prohibited than others, just as pictures which are hung up are worse than pictures which are not hung up, for how easily they can lead to glorification, and cause grief or be a source of boasting! We cannot say that these pictures are kept for memory's sake, because true memories of a Muslim relative or friend reside in the heart, and we remember them by praying for mercy and forgiveness for them. Taking pictures with a camera involves human actions such as focusing, pressing the shutter, developing, printing, and so on. We cannot call it anything other than &quot;picture-making&quot; or tasweer, which is the expression used by all Arabic-speakers to describe this action. In the book Al-I'laam bi naqd kitaab al-halaal wa'l-haraam, the author says: &quot;Photography is even more of an imitation of the creation of Allaah than pictures which are engraved or drawn, so it is even more deserving of being prohibited There is nothing that could exclude photography from the general meaning of the reports.&quot; (p. 42, see also Fataawa Islamiyyah, 4/355). Among the scholars who have discussed the issue of photography is Shaykh Naasir al-Deen al-Albaani, who said: &quot;Some of them differentiate between hand-drawn pictures and photographic images by claiming that the latter are not products of human effort, and that no more is involved than the mere capturing of the image. This is what they claim. The tremendous energy invested the one who invented this machine that can do in few seconds what otherwise could not be done in hours does not count as human effort, according to these people! Pointing the camera, focusing it, and taking the picture, preceded by installation of the film and followed by developing and whatever else that I may not know about none of this is the result of human effort, according to them! Some of them explain how this photography is done, and summarize that no less than eleven different actions are involved in the making of a picture. In spite of all this, they say that this picture is not the result of human action! Can it be permissible to hang up a picture of a man, for example, if it is produced by photography, but not if it is drawn by hand? Those who say that photography is permitted have &quot;frozen&quot; the meaning of the word &quot;tasweer,&quot; restriciting it only to the meaning known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and not adding the meaning of photography, which is &quot;tasweer&quot; or &quot;picture-making&quot; in every sense - linguistic, legal, and in its harmful effects, and as is clear from the definition mentioned above. Years ago, I said to one of them, By the same token, you could allow idols which have not been carved but have been made by pressing a button on some machine that turns out idols by the dozen. What do you say to that?&quot; (Aadaab al-Zafaaf by al-Albaani, p. 38) It is also worth quoting the opinion of some contemporary scholars who allow the taking of photographs but say that the pictures should not be kept: &quot;The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or pictures.&quot; (See al-Sharh al-Mumti', 2/198). There are many bad things involved in the making of pictures. Besides the element of imitating the creation of Allaah - which is an accusation denied by many of those who make pictures - reality bears witness to the great extent of immorality and provocation of desires caused by the prevalence of pictures and picture-making nowadays. We must remove or blot out every picture, except when it is too difficult to do so, like the pictures which are overwhelmingly prevalent in food packaging, or pictures used in encyclopaedias and reference books. We should remove what we can, and be careful about any provocative pictures that may be found. &quot;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can&quot; [al-Taghaabun 64:16 - interpretation of the meaning] Photographs which are essential are permitted - such as those required for identity documents, or for identifying or pursuing criminals [e.g. &quot;wanted&quot; posters and the like - translator's note], or for educational purposes which cannot be achieved otherwise. The principle in sharee'ah is that we should not exaggerate about what is necessary. We ask Allaah to accept our repentance and have mercy on us, and to forgive our excesses, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

What is your advice with regard to such behavior?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.If the meal is put in front of a person without his own intention being to miss the congregational prayer, then he can eat and drink, even if he misses the Maghrib congregational prayer , based on the statement of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), &quot;If the meal is served and the prayer starts, begin with the meal.&quot; (Al-Bukhari, 631) As for putting a large portion of food out purposely to miss the congregational prayer, this is the wrong approach and incorrect behavior. Then what is the sunnah ? The sunnah is what is reported on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) &quot;that he used to break the fast before he prayed with fresh dates, if there were no fresh dates then with dry dates, and if there were no dry dates, then he sipped from water.&quot; (At-Tirmidhi and others.

   out loud when entering the masjid (while others are praying or during the khutbah) ?
   Please advise the daleel. Jazzakallhu Khayrun</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The author of Zaad al-Mustanfi said it is permissible for the imaam to greet the congregation with salaam when he faces them. Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen said, in his interesting comment, that this is because this practice was reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). Even though there is some weakness in this hadeeth (i.e. in its isnaad), this is what the ummah has done and it is well known that when the imaam comes and gets up on the minbar, he greets the people with salaam. (Reported by al-Shubi). Abu Bakr and Umar used to do this. Reported by Abd al-Razzaaq , Ibn Abi Shaybah, 2/114, Ibn Maajah and al-Tabaraani. It was also reported by al-Bayhaqi from Jaabir ibn Umar, narrating from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), then he said: a report concerning this was narrated from Ibn Abbaas from Umar ibn Abd al-Azeez. Then the shaykh said in his commentary: it is not permitted to speak when the imaam is delivering the khutbah, it is only permitted before and after the khutbah, even after the khateeb has arrived and after the adhaan, so long as the khateeb has not started his khutbah. (Ibn Uthaymeen, Al-Sharh al-Muttabi li Zaad al-Mustanfi, 5/78). [?? Makath ??] is well known, from which we know that it is obligatory to return the greeting of salaam, so in this case we understand that it is not forbidden to speak. And Allaah knows best. Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni: When the imaam faces the people, he greets them with salaam and they respond, then he sits down. Then he mentioned the hadeeth quoted above, and others. Then he said (may Allaah have mercy on him): When he greets them with salaam, the people should respond, because it is more of an obligation to return the greeting than to initiate it. Then he should sit down and rest until the muadhdhinoon (muezzins) finish. (al-Mughni 2/297). And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family.</answer>

    <title>Obligation of changing one's name upon accepting Islaam</title>
    <question>Is it mandatory for one who newly embraces Islaam to change his or her name?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. He or she is not required to change his or her name unless it embodies the worship of someone or something other then God, Allaah. However, its amelioration by choosing a new Islamic name is legitimate and encouraged. The fact that he or she would change his or her name from a pagan or non-Islamic name to an Islamic one would be considered commendable--however, it is not mandatory. Thus, if one's name is Abdul-Messiah, for example, or similar such names, then he is obligated to change it, as the Prophet (peace upon him) had people with the names Abdul-Ka'bah and Abdul-Uzzah change their names upon accepting Islaam. If the original name does not comprise or imply anything forbidden in Islaam, then he or she is permitted to retain it (such as the name George, for example). As noted, though, it is preferable to change it to an Islaamic name, as this also distinguishes him or her from the kuffaar. Note that if changing one's name in official documents and records poses a great inconvenience, it would suffice to change it among the people. In this case, he or she is called by his or her new name by friends, acquaintances, and the general public, while offical documents would retain the original given name.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on having a dog</title>
    <question>ALSALAAM ALAIKUM
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT KEEPING PETS IN THE HOUSE.I KNOW THAT THE KALB(DOG)IS CONSIDERED NIJASA, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY.
I REMEMBER A SECTION IN THE Qur'an WHERE THE PROPHET PEACE BE UPON HIM ONCE GAVE A THIRSTY DOG WATER TO DRINK OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT. COULD YOU PLEASE ELABORATE.
THANK YOU</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. According to Islaamic Shareeah, it is not permitted to keep a dog except within narrowly-defined limits, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) explained: &quot;Whoever keeps a dog, his good deeds will decrease every day by one qeeraat (a unit of measurement), unless it is a dog for farming or herding.&quot; According to another report: &quot;. . . unless it is a dog for herding sheep, farming or hunting.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 2322) Dogs are extremely naajis (impure, unclean). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;If a dog drinks from the vessel of any one of you, let him wash it seven times&quot; (reported by Muslim, no. 279). According to another report: &quot;. . . and clean it the eighth time with earth.&quot; (Saheeh Muslim, no. 280). It is forbidden in Islaam to sell a dog and to receive payment for it, as is reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaari from Abu Masoud al-Ansaari: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade (accepting) the price of a dog. (al-Fath, no. 2237) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us not to resemble dogs by placing our forearms on the ground during sujood (prostration), as in reported in the hadeeth narrated by Anas ibn Maalik, according to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Do sujood properly; none of you should spread his forearms like a dog does.&quot; (al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 822). Whoever keeps a dog in his house is denied the blessing of the angels presence in his house, as the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3225). Keeping dogs nowadays is the habit of the kuffaar, who adopt them as friends, kiss them, let them lick them and their clothes, sleep with them and even leave them money in their wills. Keeping a dog is an imitation of the kuffaar. Some Muslims may claim that they need to keep a dog at home for purposes of protection, to which we respond that nowadays there are burglar alarm systems and other measures one may take for security purposes, and there is no need to keep a dog, praise be to Allaah. It only remains for us to say that the fact that it is forbidden to keep a dog and interect closely with it does not mean that we should not be kind or feel compassion towards dogs if we see them in a pitiful state. These are two entirely separate matters. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that &quot;a man saw a dog biting the dust because of thirst, so he took his shoe and started to scoop water up with it until the dogs thirst was quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and granted him entry to Paradise for it.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 174). According to another report, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whilst a man was walking he became very thirsty, so he went down to a well and drank from it. When he came out, he saw a dog panting and biting the soil because of thirst. The man said, He is suffering the same as I suffered, so he filled his shoe (with water), came out and let the dog drink until his thirst was quenched. Allaah appreciated his good deed and forgave him because of it.&quot; The people asked, &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, will we be rewarded for how we treat animals?&quot; He said, &quot;In every living thing there is a reward.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 2363). We do not want to omit reminding you of the importance of reading the Quraan properly and referring to it. You say in your question that the story of the thirsty dog is in the Quraan, and that is not the case, as it is reported in the Sunnah. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Declaring shahaadah and performing salaat for a new non-Arabic speaking Muslim</title>
    <question>I have read the many pages of your web site that instructs a non-believer. I believe that there is only Allah (one God). Ibelieve that Muhammed is the seal of the prophets. History bears this out. My question is: How do I declare this (shahadah) if I do not speak arabic? How do I perform the five daily prayers (salah) without understanding arabic? Finally would I have to change my name?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.To the dear inquirer:I welcome you with a warm greeting. I was besieged with great joy as I discovered your question while browsing through the ten questions which arrived during the past hour today, and it was the dearest question for me. This fact is not surprising, as how could our hearts not open to a wise man who has discovered the truth and has acknowledged and confirmed it for himself--one who wishes to embrace Islaam and asks about the next steps? In reality, everything that poses a problem for you is actually an easy matter, and can be solved simply, God willing (in shaa' Allaah), so let's take them one by one: First: all that is required of you to embrace this religion right now as you are reading these lines is to pronounce al-shahaadatain, or the two confirmations and attestations of faith, to the best of your ability. Perfect pronunciation of the Arabic letters is not required, and the following is a transliteration of the phrases with English letters to help you: ash-hadu an laa ilaahah illallaah (I bear witness and attest that there is no god worthy of worship but the One God Allaah) ash-hadu anna muhammad-ar-rasool ullaah (I bear witness and attest that Muhammad is the messenger of Allaah) After pronouncing them, you should promptly hasten to take a shower to purify yourself and prepare to start performing your regular prayers which will be an obligation as soon as you have declared your belief. Second: If you have not yet learned the manner and characteristics of performing the prayer (i.e. at least the movements and positions), appended to this message is a description from which you can learn. What is requried from you for the time being is to say in the beginning of the prayer and between each movement between positions &quot;Allaahu ak-bar&quot; (a glorification of Allaah). While standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting, you should say &quot;subhaan allaah wal-hamdu lillaah wa-laa ilaaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar.&quot; (Glory be to Allaah, and praise and thanks be to Allaah, and there is no god but Allaah, and Allaah is the most Exalted and Great.) Then conclude the prayer by turning your head to the right then left, each time saying &quot;as-salaamu alaikum.&quot; This way of performing salaat is permissible for you until you can learn and memorize what should be said in each movement and position of the salaat. Third: You are not required to change your name, and in fact, a number of scholars among the forefathers and modern-day Muslims have indicated declared that your name is in fact the name of one of the prophets! I ask Allaah to aid you and ease your affairs, and to bestow upon you the blessing of Islaam and perseverence in adhering to it. We are ready and willing to assist in explaining or helping to solve any problem or difficulty you may face, and to provide support and aid in any way possible.</answer>

    <title>Wali of Muslimah if her parents are kuffaar</title>
    <question>I come from a muslim family and was brought up with Islamic faith. Although, I have been through a stage in my life which I call the &quot;dark stage&quot; of my life, in which I was involved with &quot;jahiliyah&quot; practices for some years (yes, those irresponsible and sinful acts). Allah has blessed me with guidance and brought me to His straight path again. Since that time, I have been having a relationship with a christian girlfriend, who has accepted Islam just recently, by Allah's will. We plan to be wedded soon after we are settled. One problem is that she comes from a devout Christian family, not to mention her father being a christian priest. Ever since her family found out about our involvement, they have tried almost everything to part us, we haven't told them about my girlfriend's conversion though. Right now, our relationship has reached a point where she is willing to oppose her family and runaway from them eventually. Even though we know it will be hard to go through, my girlfriend and I really love each other. As I understand, the Islamic law requires that in marriage, a woman should be accompanied by a &quot;wali&quot;, which to my knowledge, should come from her family. My first question, can our plan to marry without her family's consent be in accordance with Islamic law?
And second, if it can, who can be her &quot;wali?&quot;, since not one of her family member agree with our relationship.
Thank you, assalaammu'alaikum.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.First, I offer thanks to Allaah for his grace in having guided you to the path of truth after experiencing a dark journey through 'jahiliyyah', a journey into ignorance and meaninglessness. Allaah guides to his truth whomever he wills. At this point of your life, as an expression of gratitude for Allaah's blessing, you should carry out your duties towards him and desist from the actions that gain his wrath. In fact, Allaah, at this point in your life, must take priority over everything else. You further ought to make up for what you missed in the previous part of your life, to double your efforts in performing worship and to haste in doing good deeds. Secondly, since this lady in question has converted to Islam, thanks to Allaah, none of her kaafir family members can act as a guardian (wali) of her interests; no kaafir can act in this capacity over a Muslim. If there is a Muslim with some authority in your area over the affairs of the Muslim community, then he can act in this capacity, based on the Prophet's (peace be upon him) hadeeth: &quot;No marriage contract can be concluded without the presence of a Wali. A Sultan (authority figure) can act as a Wali for those without one.&quot; (see Ibn Majah and Imam Ahmad, Hadith number 1880; also in Salih al-Jaami', hadeeth number 7556.) If there is no authoritative Muslim person, then one should refer to the community Muslim leader or any Muslim who is just ('aadil), respected, and of high character, such as the director of the Islamic center or its imam, to conclude the marriage contract of this sister, with her consent.</answer>

    <question>Who goes to heaven?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.We have been told by the Creator of Heaven of the qualities of those who will go to Heaven. We read in Verse 40 of Surat al-Mumin, or the Believer: &quot;...and he that works a righteous deed  Whether man or woman  And is a believer  Such will enter the garden (of bliss): therein will they have abundance without measure&quot;. We also read in Verses 13 and 14 of Surat al-Ahqaf: (Verily those who say, &quot;Our Lord is Allah&quot;, and remain firm (on that path), - On them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve (13) Such shall be companions of the garden, dwelling therein (for aye): a recompense for their (good) deeds. (14)). And in Verse 60 of Surat Maryam, or Mary: (&quot;Except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness: for those will enter the garden and will not be wronged in the least. (60) ) All those who submit to Allah, do what He asked and avoid what He proscribed will go to Heaven.</answer>

    <title>Reserving one's grave</title>
    <question>Aassalaam walaikum.Is it permissable to reserve a grave
for oneself or member of family?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. It is not desirable for a person to dig his grave ahead of time as this was not done by Prophet (peace be upon him) nor by his companions. A person does not know where he will die. If the intention of the person is to get ready for death, then preparation should be in good deeds. (See selections of Jurisprudence writings by Ibn Taymiyah, Funeral Rights, by al-Albani, p.160, 40th ed, Islamic Center).In otherwords, preperation for meeting Allaah, is not by digging graves. Instead, it is accomplished by overabundance of good deeds. If it is not possible in predominantly non-Muslim countries to have a cemetery or dedicated plot for the burial of Muslims unless the graves are reserved beforehand (e.g., to raise the funds), then there would be no objection in this case.</answer>

    <title>Description of Islamic Ghusl (Complete Body Ablution)</title>
    <question>This is a simply question. I just to know, what is the best way to perform Ghusal. All the fards and sunnahs. Please describe..</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praises are Due to Allah A brief summary of the requirements for the Ghusl follow. First, the Muslim should make their intentions for purification, then wash the private parts. Then make wudu like the wudu done for prayer, then pour water on his right side, then the left side. Then water should be poured on his head, covering the entire body with water. It is also reported in the sunnah that the washing the feet should be delayed until the end of the ghusl. As is reported on the authority of A'ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when performing ghusl from janaba used to wash his hands, then wash his private parts with his left hand. After that he performed wudu like that for prayer. Next he took some water and ran his fingers in the roots of his hair until he used three handfuls of water on his head. He would then go on pouring water on the rest of his body and wash his legs. (It was reported by Muslim #479.) In the narration of Al-Bukhari it states that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then turned aside and washed his legs. Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Circumcision for women is not obligatory</title>
    <question>I would like to know more about female circumcision in Islam. I have read the ahadith where the Prophet told a woman how to perform it. I would like to know if it is optional or obligatory, and - if it is obligatory - whether there is a certain way to do it (what part should be cut?).</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said, in his book al-Mughni: &quot;Circumcision is obligatory for men, and it is an honour for women, but it is not obligatory for them. This is the opinion of many scholars. (Imam) Ahmad said: For men it is more strictly required, but for women it is less strictly required.&quot; (al-Mughni 1/70). Circumcision of the female consists of the removal of a part of the clitoris, which is situated above the opening of the urethra. The Sunnah is not to remove all of it, but only a part. (al-Mawsuah al-Fiqhiyyah 19/28). In this matter, it is wise to follow the interests of the female: if the clitoris is large, then part of it should be removed, otherwise it should be left alone. This size of the clitoris will vary from woman to woman, and there may be differences between those from hot climates and those from cold climates. A hadith on the topic of female circumcision has been attributed to the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him), according to which he said: &quot;Circumcision is a Sunnah for men, and an honour for women,&quot; but there is some debate as to the authenticity of this hadith. See Silsilah al-Ahadith al-Daifah by al-Albani, no. 1935. How circumcision is to be performed is mentioned in the hadith narrated by Umm Atiyah, may Allah be pleased with her, according to which a woman used to perform circumcisions in Madinah. The Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) told her: &quot;Do not abuse (i.e. do not go to extremes in circumcising); that is better for the woman and more liked by her husband.&quot; (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Adab; he said this hadith is daif). The scholars opinions cited above should be sufficient explanation. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Inheritance from non-Muslims</title>
    <question>I am a Muslim and my parents are not. They have written in their will that whatever assets they have will be divided between myself, my brother and my sister (who are also not Muslims).
What is the Islamic ruling on inheritance for Muslims whose parents are non-Muslim?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. A Muslim is not permitted to inherit anything of the wealth of a non-Muslim relative, as the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;The believer does not inherit from a kaafir (disbeliever) and the kaafir does not inherit from a believer.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath 4283). According to another report, he said: &quot;The Muslim does not inherit from a kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from a Muslim.&quot; (al-Bukhaari, 6764). The Messenger of Allah (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: &quot;People who belong to two different religions do not inherit from one another.&quot; (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Faraaid, and deemed hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 7614) - because when the ties of religion are cut, the ties of inheritance are also cut, because the former is the basis of the latter. However, if a non-believer makes a will leaving one-third or less of his wealth to his child (son or daughter), one is entitled to take it, because this is a will as opposed to inheritance according to a non-Islamic system. This difference is well-known in Islamic fiqh. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>The Muslim belief concerning the destiny of non-Muslim monotheists in the Hereafter</title>
    <question>What do Muslims believe happens in the hereafter to Non-Muslims that believe in one God?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Your interest in studying Islam is something great, which we appreciate. Everyone should seek the truth wherever it may be, and follow it even if it differs from the way of their forefathers or the religion of the country or society in which they live, because salvation from the Fire of Hell on the Day of Judgement is more important than anything else. One of the most important things that the would-be student of Islam should do is to consult authentic Islamic references, in order to understand the reality of this religion. For example, one should consult translations of the meanings of the Quran and the ahaadeeth (sayings) of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace be upon him), ensuring that the translations are sound. But reading books written by non-Muslims, or by Muslims who do not really understand or practice their religion, is not a scholarly approach or a sound method of finding out the truth. Returning to your question, what do Muslims believe will happen to atheists? Or for that matter, what about monotheists who are not Muslim? Will their fate be Hell in the Hereafter? The answer is that Allaah has clearly created everything, sent His blessings on His creation, and sent Messengers and Revealed Books to tell them that whoever believes in and worships Him alone, not associating any partner with Him, will enter Paradise, and whoever denies Him, or worships something else besides Him, or takes other gods instead of Him, or says that He has a wife or son, or that the angels are His daughters, or follows a law other than that which He revealed to judge between people in truth, or turns away from His religion, will be doomed in the Hereafter to the eternal punishment of Hell. This is exact justice, and this will be the fate deserved by the one who did not give his Creator His due. Worshipping Allaah, obeying His commands and adhering to His prohibitions are basic matters, but they form the essence of the relationship between the Creator and His creation. Allah says: &quot;And I (Allaah) created not the jinns and men except they should worship Me (alone).&quot; [al-Dhaariyaat 51:56] Messengers were sent with one message: to tell their people &quot;Worship Allaah, for you have no god besides Him.&quot; Hence we may understand just how far short the person falls who believes that Allaah is one and does not associate anything with Him, but does not worship or obey Him, but rebels against Him and fails to follow His religion or Law, or the Revelation and Messengers which He sent for him and people like him. Does such a person deserve to enter Paradise or Hell? This is the person who says: &quot;I believe that there is One God Who created the universe, but I am going to stop there; I will not pray to Him or fast or perform Hajj or pay zakaat as He commanded. I am not going to carry out any duties towards Him; I will follow my own desires and do whatever I want, whether He permitted it or forbade it.&quot; Can such a person attain salvation on the Day of Judgement? Allaah sent Messengers to every nation, that they might worship Him and shun false deities. The last nation is this ummah, and the last Messenger is Muhammad (peace be upon him). Allaah sent him for the whole of mankind, the entire world, and thus abrogated the previous laws and made this religion the best and most perfect and complete. Hence it is obligatory for everyone to enter this religion, for Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&quot; [Aal Imraan 3:85] On this basis, the fate of one who says &quot;I believe in the idea of One God, but I do not want to be a Muslim, or I do not want to follow the last Revelation or the last Prophet,&quot; is clear. Furthermore, the fate of an atheist, who rejects even the belief in God, is even clearer and more evident. Finally, I hope that the matter is now clearer to you. I ask Allaah to guide us all to the truth and help us to follow it, for He is the best Supporter and Helper.</answer>

    <title>Evidence that only Allah is the Creator of life</title>
    <question>Please explain to me, according to the Quran, is it possible for a human to produce life? If not, then explain in detail about the cloning of animals and possibly humans, by humans.
Please give the answer in detail as it is confusing the minds of many, who think that in the next century science will conquer religion.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The evidence that Allah is the only Creator of life may be found in many places in the Quran and Sunnah. For example: &quot;Blessed is He in Whose Hand is the dominion, and He is Able to do all things, Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed, and He is the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving.&quot;[al-Mulk 67:1-2] &quot;Is, then, He Who creates as one who creates not?&quot;[al-Nahl 16:17] &quot;Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created . . .&quot;[al-Furqaan 25:3] Allah challenged all of mankind to create even the most insignificant creature, i.e. a fly, but no one could do that and no one ever will. Allah says: &quot;O mankind! A similitude has been coined, so listen to it (carefully): verily! Those on whom you call besides Allah cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly snatched away a thing from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.&quot;[al-Hajj 22:73] Imam al-Bukhari reported in his Saheeh from Abu Saeed (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: &quot;There is no created being but Allah created it.&quot; In Arabic, the word &quot;khalaqa&quot; means to make out of nothing, which is something that only Allah can do; it is impossible for anyone except Allah to do this. It also carries the meaning of decreeing or foreordaining. [**] See Fath al-Bari Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhari, 13/390. The Religion of Allah (Islam) is proud and cannot be defeated by the kaafirs arrogance about the knowledge they possess. Allah says: &quot;. . . [they] are deceived by the life of this world . . .&quot;[al-Anaam 6:70] &quot;They know only the outside appearance of the life of this world, and they are heedless of the Hereafter.&quot;[al-Rum 30:7] We ask Allah to help us to be steadfast in our adherence to His Religion, and to make our end good. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>An imaam is guilty    of some secret sin; should he continue in his position as imaam?</title>
    <question>A young man is an imaam in one of the
   mosques. He is, as he says, well-liked by the people at the mosque, but he knows deep down
   that he has shortcomings and is guilty of some sins, and does not deserve to be the imaam
   or to have this love and respect from people. He fears that if he remains as imaam of the
   mosque, he may become a hypocrite or show off. Should he stay in the mosque? Should he
   continue leading the people in prayer, or should he leave this position out of fear of
   becoming a hypocrite and show off?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.You describe this young man as being loved by his people, but he is guilty of some transgression which is a matter between him and his Lord. I say that the fact that Allaah has blessed him with the position of imaam and the love of his people dictates that he should give up his sin and stop transgressing against himself, and he should worship Allaah properly, and give thanks to Allaah, because the fact that a person is loved by his people and is their imaam is a great blessing from Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And the slaves of the Most Beneficient (Allaah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness And those who say: Our Lord and make us leaders for the muttaqoon (the pious) [al-Furqaan 25:63-74] Those who pray are among the pious, and the one who leads them in prayer is imcluded in this aayah, and make us leaders for the muttaqoon (the pious) So let him praise Allaah for this blessing, and stop transgressing against himself, and let him make this one of the means of bringing himself back to obedience to Allaah, and let him fear Allaah with regard to his status. When he says that he is afraid he may show off, this is waswaas (insinuating thoughts) that the Shaytaan puts into a persons mind whenever he wants to do an act of obedience to Allaah. The Shaytaan comes to him and says, You are showing off. He has to cast this idea aside, ignore it and seek the help of Allaah, for he always recites in his salaah the words, Iyyaaka nabudu wa iyyaaka nastaeen (You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help [al-Faatihah 1:5  interpretation of the meaning].</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The Permanent Committee for Iftaa' (Islamic Rulings), chaired by Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baz, has replied to this question by ruling that it is not permissible to copy software without permission from the original author or the copyright holder based on the following three haadeeth of the Prophet (peace be upon him): (1) &quot;Muslims are to honor their agreements (with others)&quot;; (2) &quot;A Muslim's wealth is forbidden for others to use without his permission;&quot; and, (3) &quot;Whoever is the first to acquire a mubaah (something lawful to acquire) is entitled to keep it&quot;. This applies to both Muslims and non-believers (who are not engaged in an act of war with Muslims) because the right of a non-believer is respected in the same manner as a Muslim's right. Allah knows best. (Committee Fatwa no: 18453) Also, Sheikh Muhammad bin Salih Al-'Uthaimeen has ruled that whatever is customary among people should be the rule except when a user wants a copy for himself and the author or the copyright holder did not explicitly prohibit copying the software for private or public use. However, if the author or the copyright holder specifically stated that private and public copying of the software is prohibited, then it is not permissible to copy that software.</answer>

    <title>Circumcision for men</title>
    <question>Is circumcision mandatory for the man who adopts Islam? What is the Islamic rule on female circumcision?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. To the dear inquirer: We appreciate the question you have submitted, as it is an issue which is truly among those which may pose a hindrance in some cases for those who wish to adopt Islaam. In reality the issue is really simpler than many may think. Male circumcision is among the rites of Islaam and is part of the fitrah, or the innate disposition and natural character and instinct of the human creation, and is from the religion of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). Allaah has said (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Then we revealed to you (the command) to follow the pure and uncorrupted religion of Ibrahim.&quot; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &quot;The Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) was circumcisized when he was eighty years old.&quot; (Al-Bukhari, Vol 6/p. 388, Al-Salfiyya printing). Male circumcision is obligatory for the Muslim male if he is able to do it. If, however, he is unable, whether due to fear of injury or if a respected and authoritative doctor has told him he will experience profuse bleeding which may make his life miserable, then the obligation for cirumcision is waived and he does not commit a sin by not having it done. It is not permissible under any circumstance for the issue to become a hindrance for a person wanting to accept Islaam. The validity of one's acceptance of Islaam is not dependent on his performance of circumcision and it is valid for one to adopt Islaam even if he has not had himself circumcized. Regarding the issue of female circumcision, please refer to question # 328. I ask Allaah to bring you success in all that is good and to protect you from all that is evil, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad .</answer>

    <title>Ruling on dyeing hair with black</title>
    <question>I would like to know if Muslims are allowed to dye their hair (not including henna).</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Jaabir ibn Abdullah reported that Abu Quhaafah was brought on the day of the conquest of Makkah, and his head and beard were white like &quot;thaghaamah&quot; (a plant whose flowers and fruit are white). The Messenger of Allah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: &quot;Change this with something, but avoid black.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 3962). Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: At the end of time there will be people who will dye their hair black like the crops of pigeons. They will never even smell the fragrance of Paradise.&quot; (reported by Imam Ahmad, see also Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 8153). It was also reported from the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) that one should change grey hair, using any colour except black. Abu Dharr reported that the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: &quot;The best things with which to change grey hair are henna and katam (a plant similar to henna which is used as a dye).&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1675; he said: This is a saheeh hasan hadith). Dyeing hair with pure black dye is haram because the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: &quot;Avoid black,&quot; and because of the threat of punishment reported with regard to this matter. This ruling applies to both men and women. But if the black dye is mixed with another colour, so that it is no longer black, there is nothing wrong with it.</answer>

    <title>Zakat on retirement income</title>
    <question>Is zakat due on Mutual Funds investments that are in a RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) account? If yes, then is it due on the total value or only on that portion which will be available after Income Tax has been deducted at source?
(RRSP is the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. 401K Plan. Under this scheme, one can save money towards future retirement income and defer current Income Tax on the portion of the income that is being saved in the plan. The deferred income tax is later deducted at source when the funds are eventually withdrawn from the plan; however, since the withdrawals are usually done after retirement (when there is no other significant source of income), one ends up being taxed at a substantially lower tax rate. Naturally, withdrawal prior to retirement will incur higher tax rates.)</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. If a person receives an amount of money that he could not have received before, like a bonus or lump sum paid at the end of a period of work, or on retirement, no zakat is due for the time that has passed. Zakat must be paid on whatever is left of that money after an entire Hijri year has passed. If tax or anything else is deducted, then zakat is due only on the amount which the person receives, and after one year has passed. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Reason for circulating the Ka'bah counterclockwise</title>
    <question>I would like to know the signifigance and purpose of walking around the Kaabar Sha'rif. Why is it to be kept to the left? Is the walking only done at Mecca or is it done on a daily basis as well?
Any information you could give me would be greatly appreciated.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The basic reason for keeping the Ka'bah on ones left when performing tawaaf (circumbabulation) is to follow the suit of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Following the Prophet has been ordained in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Obey the Prophet so that you may be blessed with mercy&quot; and &quot;Say (O Muhammad): if you really love Allaah, then follow my suit and Allaah will love you and grant you forgiveness of your sins&quot;. The Prophet , furthermore, has said regarding the rituals of Hajj and Umrah, &quot;Follow my suit in performing your rituals&quot;. (See Al-Nisaa'i as reported by Jaabir. Also, Sahih al-Jami', hadith No. 7882.) This should suffice as the reason for a Muslim to perform tawaaf around the Ka'bah in the way it is done, and we do not need other reasons that attempt to tie this act to the movement of galaxies and stars or the revolving of planets, etc. Muslims by nature must believe, submit to and act according to what was validly and duly recorded as the behavior or statements of the Prophet. If on top of this a reason or some relevant wisdom comes to be known, then so be it, thanks to Allaah. Otherwise, a Muslim submits to the order of Allaah and His prophet and will accordingly be recompensed for his compliance and deeds. Finally, we must note that circumbabulation is an act specified only for the Ka'bah as part of the worship and is not to be done in other places or situations as such. Allaah is the Most Knowledgeable and knows best.</answer>

    <title>Reciting verses of the Qur'aan a specific number of times and with a specific intention</title>
    <question>Assalam o Alaikum
I want to ask that , Is it right if somebody recite some Quranic aya for a specific purpose like for example If I read the one of the name of Allah for 99 times and after I make a Dua that May Allah fulfill my that wish. And its just begging from Allah with no shirk.
Please answer me Jazakallah</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Allaah has said (interpretation of the meaning): Unto Allaah belong the beautiful names. Pray to (and ask of) Him using them. As part of the prayer to Allaah using His names, we call on him by saying, O Merciful, have mercy on me; O Forgiver, forgive my sins; O Provider, provide for me, etc. However, to read a specific verse a certain number of times (whether 99 times or whatever else) without any valid documented evidence is a bidaah (an unacceptable act of innovation in religious practices) that is not permissible. Such acts invent a way to worship Allaah which was not revealed or taught by Islam. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Whoever innovates in our religion a new act (of worship) then his act is rejected&quot; (Sahih al-Bukhari, Fath al-Baari No. 2697.) The best guidance is that of the Prophet . There is no allowance for innovation in the religion of Allaah. Is it possible for us to discover new things in our religion that the Prophet didnt know? Indeed, it is incumbent upon us to read the Koran in the way the Prophet read it, we need to pray in the way he prayed, and glorify Allaahs name in the way the Prophet has been validly reported to have done. Only Allaah is the one who provides success, and He is the one who guides to the right path.</answer>

    <title>Religious celebrations in islam</title>
    <question>I need to know about any celebrations of this religions or any festivals.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.As Muslims, we celebrate only two eid (festivals): eid ul-fitr (after the end of Ramadhan), and eid ul-Udh-ha, the day of the greater hajj (pilgrimage). During these two festivals, we offer felicitations, spread joy, and entertain children. But more importantly, we offer remembrance of Allaah's blessings, celebrate His name and offer the eid salaat (prayer). Other than these two occasions, we do not recognize or celebrate any other days in the year. Of course, there are other joyous occasions for which the Islamic shariah dictates appropriate celebration, such as gathering for special meals during weddings or on the occasion of the birth of a child (aqeeqah). However, these days are not specified as particular days in the year; rather, they are celebrated as they happen in the course of a Muslims life.</answer>

    <question>What were the Scientific Achievements of Islam? Please tell me the answer as soon as possible!</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The greatest achievement of Islam is that it has freed man from the worship of other beings and delivered him to the worship of the creator of all beings. As a religious text, the Qur'aan is not a record of inventions or discoveries in this life, but rather a revealed book that helps in the replenishment, enlightenment and solace of humanity. Through it, man can help in the development and civilization of this earth, and through it man can ponder the signs of Allaah's creation. Accordingly, Muslims have concentrated on the study of this universe and made great strides in the fields of medicine, astronomy, mathematics, physics, etc. However, the specifics of these contributions are not the area of concentration for Muslim scholars, and there are perhaps better sources than this forum to explain the role of Muslim scientists, such as books written for this specific purpose. One can always refer to books written by fair-minded non-Muslims about the achievements of al-Khawarizmi in mathematics, Ibn Haytham in physics, al-Idrisi in geography,and Ibn Nafees in the circulatory system.etc.</answer>

Is it wrong for a sister to ask for talaq? Will she be punished on the Day of Judgment? Does the Arsh of Ar-Rahman shake once talaq is asked for? This is what one sister, growing up in the West, is being told by her husband from the East.</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Divorce in Islam When can a woman ask for divorce? Seeking divorce for no reason Does the Throne of Allah shake because of divorce? Praise be to Allah.Divorce in Islam The divorce of a Muslim woman from her husband is an affair which is loathsome to Allah and not a praiseworthy event. This is due to the problems and possible evils. When can a woman ask for divorce? However, if there is a situation in the marital life taking place between the man and the woman, due to a defect or defects in one or both of them, such as problems of Din, bad character, sickness, or a defect such as being sterile or similar, then out of the mercy of Allah, seeking divorce is permissible. In this case, it is okay and there is nothing prohibited in seeking a divorce . Seeking divorce for no reason The thing which is prohibited is a wife seeking a divorce from her husband for no (valid) reason in the Shariah. There is a serious promise made for seeking a divorce without a valid reason. It is reported in the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), &quot;If a woman asks her husband for a divorce, for no reason, then the smell of Paradise is forbidden for her&quot;. (At-Tirmidhi narrated it. He said this is a hasan hadith. Sunan At-Tirmidhi, 1187.) Does the Throne of Allah shake because of divorce? The hadith &quot;Marry and do not divorce for verily divorce causes the Arsh (Throne of Allah) to shake &quot; is forged and da'if. (Al-Jami` al-Saghir, 2429) And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <question>What do Muslims believe about Jesus (peace be upon him)?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related What do Muslims believe about Jesus? Creation of Jesus Miracles of Jesus Was Jesus crucified? Praise be to Allah.What do Muslims believe about Jesus? Muslims respect and revere Jesus (peace be upon him), and await his second coming. They consider him one of the greatest of Gods messengers to mankind. A Muslim never refers to him simply as `Jesus', but always adds the phrase &quot;peace be upon him.&quot; Creation of Jesus The Quran confirms his virgin birth (a chapter of the Quran is entitled `Mary') in her time, and Mary is considered the purest woman in all creation. The Quran describes the creation of Jesus as follows (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Behold! the Angel said, `God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you glad tidings of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and the Hereafter, and one that shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of the righteous.' She said: `O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: `Even so; God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He but says to it, &quot;Be!&quot; and it is.&quot; (Al Imran 3:42-7) Jesus (peace be upon him) was born miraculously through the same power which had brought Adam (peace be upon him) into being without a father: &quot;Truly, the likeness of Jesus unto Allah is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then said to him, `Be!' and he was.&quot; (Al Imran 3:59) Miracles of Jesus During his prophetic mission, Jesus (peace be upon him) was granted and performed many miracles. The Quran tells us that he said (interpretation of meaning): &quot;I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by Allahs leave. And I heal the blind and the lepers, and I raise the dead by Allahs leave.&quot; (Al Imran 3:49) Other miracles include speaking soon after birth in defense of his mother's piety. God's other gifts to him included healing the blind and the sick, reviving the dead, and, most importantly, the message he was carrying. Was Jesus crucified? These miracles were granted to him by God to establish him as a prophet. According to the Quran, he was not crucified , but it only appeared so; instead, Allah raised him unto Heaven. (An-Nisa 4:157) Neither Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), nor Jesus (peace be upon him), came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in one God , brought by earlier prophets, but to confirm and renew it. In the Quran Jesus (peace be upon him), is reported as saying that he came: &quot;To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me.&quot; (al Imran 3:50) And Allah knows best.</answer>

   having kids is OK in Islam, but limiting it is not. I have four kids, wal Hamdu li Llah,
   and I am in my 36th year and about to turn 37. Actually I love kids, and I feel guilty
   having my IUD, a means to avoid pregnancy, for my 5th year now. My husband is a good
   Muslim, wal Hamdu li Llah, but he does not like me to have more kids. Finally, I decided,
   and told him about it, next month, in-sha-Allah, I plan to remove that device from my
   body. For you information this device is causing problems in my menstrual timing (monthly
   period), and also causes infection.   Thanks, and baraka Allahu feekom.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The answer to your question is found in the following three points: Giving birth is the right of both husband and wife, and neither one of them has the right to deprive the other from doing so. It is prohibited to take any measure which would permanently prevent pregnancy, or cause infertility. It is permissible, however, to use temporary birth control methods to delay pregnancy, as in the case of delaying pregnancy for the two years of breast feeding the first child. It is prohibited to use any birth control method which would harm the body, as the Prophet said: &quot;Do not (impose) harm, nor (inflect) harm&quot;. He also said: &quot;And your body has a right upon you&quot;.</answer>

If you delay the payment of the telephone bill they add an extra amount by a certain percentage of the bill and if you further delay by another month an extra amount is added to the previous total using the same percentage on the whole amount. Are these extra amounts riba or if it is not riba is it still haram to pay this extra amount? Jazakallah kheir</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. Yes, this extra amount is undoubtedly considered ribaa, as the longer period for payment they allow you the more they increase the amount for you to pay. You need to refuse this kind of transaction. If you are forced, then pay the original sum without the extra amount. If you are forced to pay the extra amount, then pay it while offering repentance to Allaah and committing not to deal in such transactions again.</answer>

    <title>Abnormal relationship between women</title>
    <question>I am a believer and I am in love with a believer. We are both women and have already had children who we are taking good care of, but their fathers have deserted us . We both want to live as good muslims, but we love each other so much . We have been told culturally that our love is an abomination, however we cannot find anything in the Qur'an which condemns us or our actions. We are hurting no one. We are employed. We are educating our children and nurturing our families. We know the passage in the Qur'an about Soddem and Gommorah, but that appears to deal with the rape of men by men. It does not speak to monogamous love between two women. We love Allah and want to do his will. We need more information about our situation.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Just as illicit sexual relations can occur between men, they can also occur between women. The Muslim fuqahaa call this sihaaq (lesbianism), which they define as sexual relations between one woman and another (al-Mufassal fi Ahkaam al-Marah by Zaydaan, 5/450), and state that it is a punishable offence (the punishment is a form of discipline for disobedience; no specific punishment is given in the Quraan, so the punishment is to be set by the Qaadi according to the circumstances of the crime and the one who commits it). The lesbians testimony is unacceptable because she is a evildoer (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 24/253). Ibn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &quot;If two women masturbate one another, then they are cursed fornicators&quot; (al-Mughni 10/162). Some of the scholars, like al-Izz ibn Abd al-Salaam say that a lesbian is not permitted to look at a Muslim woman, and that a Muslim woman is not permitted to uncover (take off her hijaab) in front of a lesbian, because she is an evildoer who cannot be trusted not to describe her to others. If what is described above is the nature of the relationship between the two women mentioned in the question, then they must repent sincerely to Allaah and stop their evil actions. If their being together in one place will lead to them committing this sin, then they must never meet, so as to avoid this wrongful act. Their husbands desertion of them may be one of the reasons for them falling into this kind of perversion, because they have no legitimate way in which to fulfil their desires and so they have resorted to this haraam way. So they must think seriously of finding Muslim husbands with whom they can live in the way prescribed by Islaam. As for love, this is a different kind of sin, which need not necessarily be associated with physical desire. It is dangerous because it leads to the lover worshipping the beloved, so that he thinks only of the one he loves, cannot bear to be parted from him by day and dreams about him at night; he lives and dies for his sake, and may change when he sees him and become sick when he is absent. This kind of relationship destroys a persons mental health and destroys his relationship with his Lord, because it makes the lover worship his beloved and it is haraam to worship anything other than Allaah. The solution to this disastrous situation is total separation, so that one will never see that person, or hear news of him again.</answer>

    <title>Justification for following the Sunnah</title>
    <question>Why do we have to follow the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad and not just follow the quraan ?
Why do we have to follow a specific Mathab?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The first question may appear strange and somewhat surprising to committed, practising Muslims. How can something which is so obviously one of the bases of Islaam become a matter for discussion and debate? But since the question has been asked, we will present, with the help of Allaah, the principles and bases of the importance of the Sunnah, the obligation to follow it and the ruling concerning those who reject it. By so doing, we will also refute the doubters and the misguided group who call themselves Quraaniyyeen (the Quraan has nothing to do with them!) In sha Allaah this discussion will be of benefit to everyone who wants to understand the truth of the matter. Proof of the importance of the Sunnah (1) The Quraan speaks of the importance of the Sunnah, for example: (a) Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): He who obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allaah . . . [al-Nisaa 4:80] Allaah described obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as being a part of obedience to Him. Then He made a connection between obedience to Him and obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him): O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger . . . [al-Nisaa 4:59] (b) Allaah warns us not to go against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and states that whoever disobeys him will be doomed to eternal Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): . . . And let those who oppose the Messengers commandment beware, lest some fitnah (trial, affliction, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them. [al-Nur 24:63] (c) Allaah has made obedience to His Prophet a religious duty; resisting or opposing it is a sign of hypocrisy: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you [Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission. [al-Nisaa 4:65] (d) Allaah commands His slaves to respond to Him and His Messenger: O you who believe! Answer Allaah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life . . . [al-Anfaal 8:24] (e) Allaah also commands His slaves to refer all disputes to him: . . . (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger . . . [al-Nisaa 4:59] (2) The Sunnah itself indicates the importance of the Sunnah. For example: (a) Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi and others that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I do not want to see any one of you reclining on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying I dont accept it; we didnt find any such thing in the Book of Allaah. Abu Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Shaakir edition, no. 2663). Al-Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Would any of you think, reclining on his couch, that Allaah would only describe what is forbidden in the Quraan? I tell you, by Allaah, that I have warned and commanded and prohibited things that are as important as what is in the Quraan, if not more so. (Reported by Abu Dawud, Kitaab al-Khiraj wal-imaarah wal-fay). (b) Abu Dawud also reported from al-Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) led us in prayer one day, then he turned to us and exhorted us strongly . . . (he said), Pay attention to my sunnah (way) and the way of the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me, adhere to it and hold fast to it. (Saheeh Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Sunnah). (3) The scholars consensus (ijmaa) affirming the importance of the Sunnah. Al-Shaafii, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: I do not know of anyone among the Sahaabah and Taabieen who narrated a report from the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) without accepting it, adhering to it and affirming that this was sunnah. Those who came after the Taabieen, and those whom we met did likewise: they all accepted the reports and took them to be sunnah, praising those who followed them and criticizing those who went against them. Whoever deviated from this path would be regarded by us as having deviated from the way of the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the scholars who followed them, and would be considered as one of the ignorant. (4) Common sense indicates the importance of the Sunnah. The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allaah indicates that we must believe everything he said and obey every command he gave. It goes without saying that he has told us things and given instructions in addition to what is in the Quraan. It is futile to make a distinction between the Sunnah and the Quraan when it comes to adhering to it and responding to it. It is obligatory to believe in what he has told us, and to obey his instructions. The ruling concerning those who deny the importance of the Sunnah is that they are kaafirs, because they deny and reject a well-known and undeniable part of the religion. As regards your second question, about whether a Muslim is required to follow a particular madhhab, the answer is that he does not have to. For the average rank and file Muslim, his madhhab is that of his mufti or the scholar whom he consults for religious verdicts; he must ask those pious scholars whom he trusts for opinions when necessary. If a person has enough knowledge to distinguish which evidence and opinion is stronger, then he must follow the scholarly opinion which has the strongest support from the Quran and Sunnah. It is acceptable for a Muslim to follow one of the four well-known madhhabs, on the condition that he understands that the truth in any given issue may lie with another madhhab, in which case he must ignore his own madhhabs opinion and follow the truth. The Muslims aim is to follow the truth that is in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah. The madhhabs of fiqh are only a means of reaching ahkaam (rules) based on the Quraan and Sunnah, they are not Quraan and Sunnah. We ask Allaah to show us the truth and help us to follow it, and to show us falsehood and help us to avoid it. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Psychology: Recommended Reading</title>
    <question>Are there any books on psychology which you would recommend?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If you are asking about the names of books on the field of Islamic psychology, the answer is that unfortunately there are still very few modern books in this field. There is a need for people who have studied the Quraan and Sunnah, and who have an insight into and practical experience of human psychology, as well as knowledge of the experience and writings of non-Muslims in this field, to write about this subject properly and produce useful work in this field. In any case, there are a few modern books in this field, which include the following: Ilm al-Nafs al-Dawi (The Psychology of Dawah) by Abd al-Azeez Muhammad al-Naghmeeshi Madkhil ila al-Tarbiyah al-Islamiyah (Introduction to Islamic Education) by Abd al-Rahmaan al-Yaami Usas al-Sihhah al-Nafsiyyah lil-Tifl al-Muslim (Principles of Psychological Health of the Muslim Child) by Maalik Badri Al-Tafakkur min al-Mushaahadah ilal-Shuhood: Diraasat Nafsiyah Islamiyah (From Seeing to Bearing Witness: A Study in Islamic Psychology) by Maalik Badri Ilm al-Nafs al-Taleemi (Educational Psychology) by Muhammad Khaleefah Barakaat Araa Ibn al-Qayyim al-Tarbawiyah (The Educational Thought of Ibn al-Qayyim) by Hasan Ali Hasan al-Hijaaji Diraasaat fil-Nafs al-Insaaniyah (Studies in Human Psychology) by Muhammad Qutb Manhaj al-Tarbiyah al-Islamiyah (Methodology of Islamic Education) (2 vols.) by Muhammad Qutb Ilm al-Nafs fi Hayaatinaa al-Yawmiyah (Everyday Psychology) by Muhammad Uthmaan Najaati Ilm al-Nafs al-Takweeni (Formative Psychology) by Abd al-Hameed Muhammad al-Haashimi Al-Muraahiqoon (Teenagers) by Abd al-Azeez Muhammad al-Naghmeeshi Usool Ilm al-Nafs al-Aam (Principles of General Psychology) by Abd al-Hameed Muhammad al-Haashimi The first reference given will give you more details about these references, in sha Allaah.

    <title>The meaning of the pronoun We as used in the Quran</title>
    <question>Why does the Quran use the term
   &quot;we&quot; in its ayats?
   Many non-believers believe that this may be in reference to Jesus?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is a feature of literary style in Arabic that a person may refer to himself by the pronoun nahnu (we) for respect or glorification. He may also use the word ana (I), indicating one person, or the third person huwa (he). All three styles are used in the Quran, where Allaah addresses the Arabs in their own tongue. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 4/143). Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, sometimes refers to Himself in the singular, by name or by use of a pronoun, and sometimes by use of the plural, as in the phrase (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, We have given you a manifest victory [al-Fath 48:1], and other similar phrases. But Allaah never refers to Himself by use of the dual, because the plural refers to the respect that He deserves, and may refer to His names and attributes, whereas the dual refers to a specific number (and nothing else), and He is far above that. (Al-Aqeedah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 75). These words, innaa (Verily We) and nahnu (We), and other forms of the plural, may be used by one person speaking on behalf of a group, or they may be used by one person for purposes of respect or glorification, as is done by some monarchs when they issue statements or decrees in which they say We have decided etc. [This is known in English as The Royal We  Translator]. In such cases, only one person is speaking but the plural is used for respect. The One Who is more deserving of respect than any other is Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, so when He says in the Quran innaa (Verily We) and nahnu (We), it is for respect and glorification, not to indicate plurality of numbers. If an aayah of this type is causing confusion, it is essential to refer to the clear, unambiguous aayaat for clarification, and if a Christian, for example, insists on taking ayaat such as Verily, We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran) [al-Hijr 15:9  interpretation of the meaning] as proof of divine plurality, we may refute this claim by quoting such clear and unambiguous aayaat as (interpretation of the meanings): And your god is One God, there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful [al-Baqarah 2:163] and Say: He is Allaah, the One [al-Ikhlaas 112:1]  and other aayaat which can only be interpreted in one way. Thus confusion will be dispelled for the one who is seeking the truth. Every time Allaah uses the plural to refer to Himself, it is based on the respect and honour that He deserves, and on the great number of His names and attributes, and on the great number of His troops and angels. (Reference: Al-Aqeedah al-Tadmuriyyah by Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 109). And Allaah knows best.</answer>

I work in a different city than where my family is. My work is 250 kilometers from my family (parents, and brothers). I work from Monday to Friday and return to my family for Saturday and Sunday. I have an apartment where I work. My question is can I shorten my salaat in my working city or are both cities considered to be my home? Jazakallahu khariran

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Your home town, the one where your family lives, is your home. The town which you intend to stay in for more than four days is also considered a place of residence, according to the opinion of the majority of scholars. Therefore you are not allowed to enjoy the concessions of the traveler (i.e. shortening and combining the prayers) in either place. However, you can shorten and combine prayers while traveling in between the two places. Refer to questions under Salaat Ul-Musaafir (Prayer of the Traveler).</answer>

    <title>What Will Women Get in Jannah?</title>
    <question>I am a firm believer in the Quran and Allah. Thank Allah my faith and trust in Him grows each day. My concern is this: the Quran mentions over and over the blessings of Heaven. It repeatedly mentions beautiful, pure maidens as a bounty of Heaven. People often say Islam is a male dominance religion.
Why is there no mention of rewards for women?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related All address to men in the Quran is address to women What will women get in Jannah? Praise be to Allah.All address to men in the Quran is address to women Since you believe in Allah and His Book, you must know that {and not one will thy Lord treat with injustice}, Verse 49, Surat al-Kahf, or the Cave, and {Allah is never unjust in the least degree: if there is any good (done), He doubles it, and gives from His Own Self a great reward}, Verse 40, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women. (Translation of the meanings) Allah has meant this Law of Islam (Shari'ah) for both men and women. All address to men in the Quran is address to women as well, and all rules affecting men affect women as well unless evidence is established that one of them is meant and not the other as in the rules relating to Jihad (fighting for Islam), menstruation, custodianship, rule etc. The evidence that women are included in Verses of the Quran in the male gender is a Hadith by Aishah who said that the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) was asked about a man who sees traces of semen but does not remember having any dream of a sexual nature. The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;Such a man should perform the Ghusl (ritual bath). He was also asked of a man who remembers a dream of a sexual nature but sees no traces of semen. He said: &quot;Such a man does not have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath). Umm Salim said &quot;A woman may have the same experience. Does she have to perform the Ghusl (ritual bath)?&quot; The Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;Yes, there is no difference in this between man and woman.&quot; (Narrated by Abu Dawud, at-Tirmidhi 113 and others. The last phrase is in Sahih al-Jami under No. 2333) What will women get in Jannah? With respect to rewards in the Hereafter and what women have in Heaven , we include a number of Verses and Hadiths as follows: Umm Salamah said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah. I did not hear a Verse in the Quran regarding the Hijrah (migration with the Prophet) of women.&quot; Then was revealed the Verse: {And their Lord has accepted of them, and answered them: Never will I suffer to be lost the work of any of you, be he male or female: ye are members, one of another: those who have left their homes, and were driven out therefrom, and suffered harm in My cause, and fought and were slain, verily I will blot out from them their inequities, and admit them into gardens with rivers flowing beneath; ... A reward from Allah, and from Allah is the best of rewards.}, Verse 195, Surat al-Imran, or the Family (translation of the meaning). The Hadith was narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3023. Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse {fastajaba lahum rabbuhum} means Allah replied to their queries ... and the Verse {anni la udiu amala amilin minkum min thakarin aw untha} is an explanation of the reply meaning that good deeds will not be lost or ignored. All men and women will have the just reward for their deeds. The Verse {badukum min bad} means you will be treated equally with respect to rewards . {If any do deeds of righteousness, be they male or female, and have faith, they will enter Heaven, and not the least injustice will be done to them.}, Verse 124, Surat an-Nisa, or the Women (translation of the meaning). In explanation of this Verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said the Verse shows Allahs kindness, generosity and mercy in accepting the good deeds of all people, men and women, provided that they believe, in allowing them into Heaven and in not decreasing rewards for their good deeds, not even in the least. {Whoever works righteousness, man or woman, and has faith, verily, to him will we give a life that is good and pure, and we will bestow on such their reward according to the best of actions.}, Verse 97, Surat an-Nahl, or the Bees (translation of the meaning). Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said this is a promise by Allah, the Exalted, to those who do good deeds i.e. deeds acceptable to Allah in which a Muslim follows the rules set in the Book of Allah, the Exalted, and the Sunnah of His Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him), be they men or women, if they believe in Allah and His Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him), that He will make them live a good life in this world and will be rewarded in the Hereafter. A good life would include all types of comfort. {He that makes evil will not be requited but by the like thereof; and he that makes a righteous deed whether man or woman and is a believer, such will enter the garden (of bliss): therein will they have abundance without measure.}, Verse 40, Surat al-Muminun, or the believers (translation of the meaning). Finally; Dear Sister, here is a Hadith that will dispel any doubt you may have with respect to the mentioning of women: Umm Umarah al-Ansariyyah said that she went to the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) and said to Him: &quot;I feel that everything is for men. Women are not mentioned as having anything. Then was revealed the Verse (translation of the meaning): {For Muslim men and women, for believing men and women etc}, Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates. The Hadith is narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 3211, and is in Sahih at-Tirmidhi under No. 2565. In the collection of Hadiths of Imam Ahmad was narrated the Hadith that Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: &quot;I said &quot;O Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) of Allah. Why arent we mentioned in the Quran in an equal footing with men?&quot; Then; I was surprised to hear Him call one day from the pulpit: &quot;O people.&quot; As I was combing my hair at the moment, I wrapped it up and came close to the door and stood there listening to him say: &quot;Allah, Mighty and Sublime be He, revealed that (in meaning) {For Muslim men and women; for believing men and women; for devout men and women, for true men and women; for men and women who are patient and constant; for men and women who humble themselves; for men and women who give in charity; for men and women who fast; for men and women who guard their chastity; and for men and women who engage much in Allah's remembrance, for them has Allah prepared forgiveness and great reward.} Verse 35, Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates. We ask Allah to give us all the ability to show sincerity in words and deeds and to continue as well-established Muslims. For more, please see these answers: 114050 , 96598 and 96619 .

    <title>Repentance for neglecting prayer</title>
    <question>I am 38 years old man. till the age of 25 I
   did'nt prayed. please advice me what I have to do for this?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Remember how Allaah has blessed you by bringing you back to Islam after you have been neglecting salaah, and keep on doing the prayers at the right times. Do more naafil (supererogatory or extra) prayers to make up for the fard (obligatory) prayers that you have missed, as was advised in the saheeh hadeeth narrated by Hurayth ibn Qubaysah, who said: I came to Madeenah and prayed, O Allaah, send me a righteous companion. I went and sat with Abu Hurayrah and said: I asked Allaah to bless me with a righteous companion; tell me a hadeeth that you heard from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so that I may benefit therefrom. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say that the first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his prayer. If it is sound, he will be successful, and if it is lacking in any way, he will be doomed. If his obligatory prayers are lacking, the Lord will say: Look and see whether My slave has any voluntary prayers which may be used to make up what is lacking in his obligatory prayers. Then all his deeds will be examined and dealt with in the same way. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 413; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 2020). Abu Dawood reported from Anas ibn Hakeem al-Dabbi that he came to Madeenah and met Abu Hurayrah. He said: He asked me about my lineage so I told him about it, then he said: O young man, shall I not tell you a hadeeth? I said, Of course, may Allaah have mercy on you, and I think he mentioned it from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). He said: The first thing that people will be asked about on the Day of Resurrection will be their prayers. Our Lord will say to His angels (although He knows best): Look at My slaves prayers: are they complete or is something lacking? If they are complete, they will be recorded as such, but if something is lacking, He will say: Look and see if My slave has any voluntary prayers to his credit. If this proves to be the case, He will say: Make up his (missing) obligatory prayers with his voluntary prayers. Then the rest of his deeds will be dealt with in the same manner.

    <answer>Contents Related Tips on how to repent from zina Praise be to Allah.Tips on how to repent from zina 1) Do not despair , for Allah, the Most Exalted and Glorified, said (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Say: Oh my servants who have transgressed against their souls!

    <question>what is Id al-Adha, The festival of sacrafice. my daughter is doing a homework assignment I need as much info or where else to look as soon as possible?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Eid al-Adhaa is the tenth day of Dhool-Hijjah, the last (twelfth) month of the Hijri or Islamic calendar. It is, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The greatest day in the sight of Allaah, may He be blessed and exalted, the Day of Sacrifice . . . (Reported by Abu Dawud; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 1064). It is also the greatest day of Hajj, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) told us. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, see Saheeh al-Jaami, 8191). The reason why it is described as the greatest day of the year is that it combines so many acts of worship which are not combined on any other day, such as the Eid prayer, offering the sacrifice, reciting Takbeer (glorifying Allaah), and widespread remembrance of Allaah. For the pilgrims in Makkah, it also includes offering a sacrifice, stoning the pillars representing Shaytaan (the devil), shaving the head (for men only; women merely cut a little off their hair), and performing Tawaaf (circumambulation of the Kabah) and Saee (running between the two hills of Safaa and Marwa).</answer>

    <title>Delaying Fajr prayer beyond the proper time</title>
    <question>I always pray Fajr namaz at 7 in the morning, so do I have to pray sunnath too? or only faraz?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah. If you are praying Fajr prayer before the sun rises, then the Sunnah in your case is to pray the regular Sunnah of Fajr which is two rakahs. If you miss Fajr and do not wake up until after the sun has risen, then you should pray Sunnah and then Fard (obligatory prayer). But if you always delay Fajr prayer until after the sun has risen, this is a serious problem. In this case, before you ask about the Sunnah prayer you have to pause and ask yourself what you will say when you stand before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection, and He calls you to account for neglecting Fajr prayer.

    <title>Changing ones lineage in order to obtain nationality of a state for certain benefits</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on a person changing his lineage in order to obtain nationality of a country for certain benefits? For example, a man might claim to be the child or brother of an uncle or other relative who holds the desired nationality, so as to obtain that nationality and all the benefits etc. that come with it, even though he has a nationality and proper documents of his own, and has no problems as such; he is only doing this to serve some materialistic interests. What is the ruling on this action?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This action is haraam. It is not permissible for a person to claim to belong to anyone other than his father, because this leads to further lies, and has an impact on matters of inheritance, who is considered to be a mahram, and all other issues that have to do with lineage. Thus the texts issue stern warnings to those who claim to belong to anyone other than their fathers. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever claims to belong to anyone other than his father on him will be the curse of Allaah and the angels and all the people. (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2599; Saheeh al-Jaami, 6104). This action is also a major sin comprised of two major sins, lying in order to consume wealth unlawfully and claiming to belong to someone other than one's father. This person has to go back to what is true, and give up the nationality he aquired improperly. He should go back to using his proper documents that prove his real lineage. This is obligatory upon him. I am astounded that anyone would do such a thing for worldly gains. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whome We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell, he will burn therein disgraced and rejected, (- far away from Allaahs Mercy). [al-Isra 17:18] The one who does this had to repent to Allaah, and Allaah has forgiven what is past [al-Maaidah 5:95 interpretation of the meaning]. With regard to whatever money he has taken as a result of having that nationality, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) So whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating riba [usury] shall not be punished for the past [al-Baqarah 2:275]. This aayah is speaking about the one who consumes riba (interest or usury), so it applies even more in the case of lesser sins. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

Some of the salaf used to do this, using vessels such as plates and the like. If someone does this, he has a precedent in the salaf or early generations of Islam. He may also take as evidence the general meaning of the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And We send down from the Quraan that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe [al-Isra 17:82] If a person seeks healing from the Quraan in this manner and benefits from it (and there is no text to prove that doing so is haraam and no bad results occur), then it comes under the general meaning of this aayah.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on men wearing jewellery that is plated with18k gold</title>
    <question>In the Name of Allah, Asalamu alaikum: What is the legal ruling of men wearing jewelery that is 18k gold &quot;electroplated&quot; such as watches, belts, rings, etc. wa jazakamu Allahu khairan.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Wearing gold is haraam for men. Abdullah ibn Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw a gold ring on a mans hand. He took it off and threw it aside, saying, &quot;Would any of you take a burning coal and hold it in his hand?&quot; When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) had gone away, someone said to the man, &quot;Take your ring and benefit from it (i.e., sell it).&quot; He said, &quot;No, by Allaah, I will not take it after the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) has thrown it away.&quot; (reported by Muslim, no. 2090). Abdullah ibn Amr ibn alAas reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whoever of my ummah wears gold and dies wearing it, Allaah will deny him the gold of Paradise. Whoever of my ummah wears silk and dies wearing it, Allaah will deny him the silk of Paradise.&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad). This prohibition applies to men only, not to women, as Ali, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took a piece of silk in his right hand and a piece of gold in his left, and said: &quot;These are forbidden for the males of my ummah.&quot; (reported by al-Nisaai and Abu Dawud). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) also said: &quot;Wearing silk and gold is permitted for the women of my ummah and prohibited for the males.&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad) Gold is permitted for women because of their delicate and gentle nature, and their need for adornment. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;(Do they then like for Allaah) a creature who is brought up in adornments (wearing gold and silk ornaments, i.e., women), and in dispute cannot make herself clear?&quot; [al-Zukhruf 43:18] As for men, it is a sign of instability and an unmasculine nature to adorn oneself with gold. Islaam wants the differences between the sexes to be marked clearly, and their distinct characteristics to stand out, because when they resemble one another, much corruption results therefrom. The prohibition of gold for men includes pure gold, gold alloys, cut pieces, joined pieces, gold inlay, etc. As for gold-plating and gilding, some scholars are of the opinion that such articles are forbidden for men if it is possible to extract gold from them (by peeling or shaving off, for example); if no gold can be extracted from it, then such items are permitted. Some scholars say that it is not permitted to wear an item which is wholly or mostly gold-plated, but if only a little part of it is gold-plated (like the hands of a watch, or the numerals, or the tiny points denoting numbers), then it is permitted to wear it. They say that the issue is its appearance, not its value: if the gold-plating is very obvious and covers everything, it is not permitted, because many people will not make the distinction between gold-plate and real gold, and some may follow this persons example and begin to wear pure gold. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Divorced wife due to her family&amp;#146;s use of sihr (magic or witchcraft)</title>
    <question>In The Name Of ALLAH.
(Q)I was married to a Muslim girl, and I divorced her because, I couldn't intercourse with her,and I'm 100% O.K., and I discovered the reason for that,which was &quot;SEHER&quot;(MAGIC). We(my father and I)were advised to go to a &quot;SHIEKH&quot; to solve this problem, and that SHIEKH read some&quot;QUR'AN VERSES&quot; only,and my ex. wife was totally shaking,and was absolutely obvious that someone did a &quot;SEHER&quot; to her. After that, I discovered that my ex. wife's family use the &quot;SEHER&quot; in their life, so I decided to divorce her because,her family wanted to carry on with &quot;SEHER&quot;. Now I'm asking about any USEFUL INFORMATION to help me to overcome my problem, because I need to marry again ?
Prompt answer would be appreciated. Thanks,</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. What I advise you to do is to put your trust in Allaah and hasten to remarry. Nothing will harm you so long as you put your trust in Allaah, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;. . . And whosoever puts his trust in Allaah, then He will suffice him. . .&quot; [al-Talaaq 65:3] But this time you should make the effort to check out your future wife and her family very carefully. Take a lesson from your past experience, for the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;The believer should not stung from the same hole twice.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, no. 6133). Something that may help you not to worry is the fact that it appears from your question that the fault lay with your ex-wife, and not with you. So you must strive to recite the verses of the Quraan which offer protection (muawwidhaat i.e., Surat al-Falaq and Surat al-Naas) immediately after each prayer and before sleeping, blow into your hands when you recite them, and wipe your face and body with your hands. May Allaah protect you and us from all evil.</answer>

    <title>A weak hadeeth about Soorah Yaa-Seen</title>
    <question>What is the surah in the quran which is considered the heaert of the Quran?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There is a hadeeth which suggests that Soorah Yaa-Seen is the heart of the Quraan, but this is a weak hadeeth (see Silsilat al-Ahaadeeth al-Daeefah wal-Mawdooah by al-Albaani, hadeeth no. 169). There is no doubt that Soorah Yaa-Seen is a great and important soorah which contains moving stories and eloquent lessons, but there is no proof that it was described as the heart of the Quraan. The fact that you are asking such a question at the age of only thirteen is something which deserves praise and encouragement. May Allaah help and guide you.</answer>

    <title>One who dies believing in Islaam without converting</title>
    <question>Non-muslim dies, and I know him/her. As far as I know this person beleived and accepted Islam, but died before they could convert. What does Islam say about such a person, is he/she forgiven by Allah or still considered as one of the &quot;kaffar&quot;?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If a person does not pronounce the Shahaadatayn and enter Islaam, we cannot say that he is a Muslim, even if he admired Islaam and recognized that it the best religion, a great religion, and so on. Abu Taalib, the uncle of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) died a kaafir, and Allaah forbade His Prophet to pray for forgiveness for him, even though he used to defend the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said in his poems: &quot;I do know that the religion of Muhammad is better than all other religions of mankind; were it not for fear of blame or slander, you would find me accepting it completely.&quot; If a person accepts Islaam out of conviction, and begins to practise it, then he is a Muslim, even if he does not register his Islaam officially, or go to a court or Islaamic centre to obtain documentation, or announce it to others. If such a person dies, then we hope for Paradise for him and pray for mercy for him. And Allaah is the One Who sees all that His slaves do.</answer>

    <question>I am iving in the same house with my sister, but we end up arguing and fighting all the time. We are a close knit family, and I can not move out. I have tried talking and reasoning with her, but with no avail. How do I handle a situation like this?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. There is no mention in the question of the reason for the differences between you but, in any case, you should avoid contact with each other as much as possible, and both of you should occupy yourselves with useful things like worship, study of Islaam, etc. There are many brothers and sisters who have experienced similar problems, and when they have distanced themselves from one another, a spirit of love and friendship has returned. You both need to equip yourselves with patience, calmness and tolerance of one anothers mistakes, until Allaah brings about the marriag of either or both of you. It is the nature of life that you will part one day, so let it be on good terms. We ask Allaah to guide you both, to reconcile you and to put friendship and love in your hearts.

How does one control their temper then?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related How to control anger Seeking refuge with Allah from the Shaytan Keeping silent Not moving Following the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Do not become angry and Paradise will be yours Knowing the high status and advantages offered to those who control themselves Following the Prophets example in the case of anger Knowing that resisting anger is one of the signs of righteousness Listening to reminders Knowing the bad effects of anger The angry person should think about himself during moments of anger Du`a (Supplication) Praise be to Allah.How to control anger Anger is one of the evil whispers of Shaytan, which leads to so many evils and tragedies, of which only Allah knows their full extent. For this reason Islam has a great deal to say about this bad characteristic, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) described cures for this &quot;disease&quot; and ways to limit its effects, among which are the following: Seeking refuge with Allah from the Shaytan Sulayman ibn Sard said: &quot;I was sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and two men were slandering one another. One of them was red in the face, and the veins on his neck were standing out. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, I know a word which, if he were to say it, what he feels would go away. If he said &quot;I seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan,&quot; what he feels (i.e., his anger) would go away.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 6/337) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;If a man gets angry and says, I seek refuge with Allah , his anger will go away.&quot; (Sahih al-Jami al-Saghir, no. 695) Keeping silent The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;If any of you becomes angry, let him keep silent.&quot; (Reported by Imam Ahmad, al-Musnad, 1/329; see also Sahih al-Jami, 693, 4027) This is because, in most cases, the angry person loses self-control and could utter words of kufr/disbelief (from which we seek refuge with Allah), or curses, or the word of divorce (talaq) which would destroy his home, or words of slander which would bring him the enmity and hatred of others. So, in short, keeping silent is the solution which helps one to avoid all that. Not moving The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;If any of you becomes angry and he is standing, let him sit down, so his anger will go away; if it does not go away, let him lie down.&quot; The narrator of this hadith is Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), and there is a story connected to his telling of it: he was taking his camels to drink at a trough that he owned, when some other people came along and said (to one another), &quot;Who can compete with Abu Dharr (in bringing animals to drink) and make his hair stand on end?&quot; A man said, &quot;I can,&quot; so he brought his animals and competed with Abu Dharr, with the result that the trough was broken. [i.e., Abu Dharr was expecting help in watering his camels, but instead the man misbehaved and caused the trough to be broken]. Abu Dharr was standing, so he sat down, then he laid down. Someone asked him, &quot;O Abu Dharr, why did you sit down then lie down?&quot; He said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: . . .&quot; and quoted the hadith. (The hadith and this story may be found in Musnad Ahmad, 5/152; see also Sahih al-Jami, no. 694). According to another report, Abu Dharr was watering his animals at the trough, when another man made him angry, so he sat down . . . (Fayd al-Qadir, al-Manawi, 1/408) Among the benefits of this advice given by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is the fact that it prevents the angry person from going out of control, because he could strike out and injure someone, or even kill - as we will find out shortly - or he could destroy possessions and so on. Sitting down makes it less likely that one will become overexcited. Lying down makes it even less likely that he will do something crazy or harmful. Al-Allamah al-Khattabi, may Allah have mercy on him, said in his commentary on Abu Dawud: &quot;One who is standing is in a position to strike and destroy, while the one who is sitting is less likely to do that, and the one who is lying down can do neither. It is possible that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told the angry person to sit down or lie down so that he would not do something that he would later regret. And Allah knows best.&quot; (Sunan Abi Dawud, with Ma'alim al-Sunan, 5/141) Following the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), &quot;Advise me.&quot; He said, &quot;Do not become angry.&quot; The man repeated his request several times, and each time the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told him, &quot;Do not become angry.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath al-Bari, 10/456) According to another report, the man said: &quot;I thought about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, and I realized that anger combines all kinds of evil.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, 5/373) Do not become angry and Paradise will be yours This is an authentic hadith. (See Sahih al-Jami, 7374. Ibn Hijr attributed it to al-Tabarani, see al-Fath 4/465) Remembering what Allah has promised to the righteous (muttaqin) who keep away from the causes of anger and struggle within themselves to control it, is one of the most effective ways of extinguishing the flames of anger. One of the hadiths that describe the great reward for doing this is: &quot;Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will fill his heart with contentment on the Day of Resurrection.&quot; (Reported by al-Tabarani, 12/453, see also Sahih al-Jami, 6518). Another great reward is described in the Prophets words: &quot;Whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it, Allah will call him before all of mankind on the Day of Resurrection, and will let him choose of the Hur al-Iyn whoever he wants.&quot; (Reported by Abu Dawud, 4777, and others. It is classified as hasan (sound) in Sahih al-Jami, 6518) Knowing the high status and advantages offered to those who control themselves The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;The strong man is not the one who can overpower others (in wrestling); rather, the strong man is the one who controls himself when he gets angry.&quot; (Reported by Ahmad, 2/236; the hadith is agreed upon). The greater the anger, the higher the status of the one who controls himself. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;The strongest man is the one who, when he gets angry and his face reddens and his hackles rise, is able to defeat his anger.&quot; (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 5/367, and classified as hasan in Sahih al-Jami, 3859) Anas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) passed by some people who were wrestling. He asked, &quot;What is this?&quot; They said: &quot;So-and-So is the strongest, he can beat anybody.&quot; The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, &quot;Shall I not tell you who is even stronger than him? The man who, when he is mistreated by another, controls his anger, has defeated his own shaytan and the shaytan of the one who made him angry.&quot; (Reported by al-Bazzar, and Ibn Hijr said its isnad is sahih. Al-Fath, 10/519) Following the Prophets example in the case of anger The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is our leader and has set the highest example in this matter, as is recorded in a number of hadiths. One of the most famous was reported by Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: &quot;I was walking with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he was wearing a Najrani cloak with a rough collar. A Bedouin came and seized him roughly by the edge of his cloak, and I saw the marks left on his neck by the collar. Then the Bedouin ordered him to give him some of the wealth of Allah that he had. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) turned to him and smiled, then ordered that he should be given something.&quot; (Agreed upon. Fath al-Bari, 10/375) Another way in which we can follow the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is by making our anger for the sake of Allah, when His rights are violated. This is the kind of anger which is praiseworthy. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) became angry when he was told about the imam who was putting people off the prayer by making it too long; when he saw a curtain with pictures of animate creatures in Aishahs house; when Usamah spoke to him about the Makhzumi woman who had been convicted of theft, and he said &quot;Do you seek to intervene concerning one of the punishments prescribed by Allah?&quot;; when he was asked questions that he disliked, and so on. His anger was purely for the sake of Allah. Knowing that resisting anger is one of the signs of righteousness The righteous (al-muttaqun) are those praised by Allah in the Quran and by His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Paradise as wide as heaven and earth has been prepared for them. One of their characteristics is that they (interpretation of the meaning) &quot;spend (in Allahs Cause) in prosperity and in adversity, [they] repress anger, and [they] pardon men; verily, Allah loves al-muhsinun (the good-doers).&quot; [Al Imran 3:134] These are the ones whose good character and beautiful attributes and deeds Allah has mentioned, and whom people admire and want to emulate. One of their characteristics is that (interpretation of the meaning) &quot;. . . when they are angry, they forgive.&quot; [al-Shura 42:37] Listening to reminders Anger is a part of human nature, and people vary in their anger. It may be difficult for a man not to get angry, but sincere people will remember Allah when they are reminded, and they will not overstep the mark. Some examples follow: Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that a man sought permission to speak to Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), then he said: &quot;O son of al-Khattab, you are not giving us much and you are not judging fairly between us.&quot; Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) was so angry that he was about to attack the man, but al-Hurr ibn Qays, who was one of those present, said: &quot;O Amir al-Muminin, Allah said to His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (interpretation of the meaning): Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the foolish [al-Araf 7:199]. This man is one of the foolish.&quot; By Allah, Umar could go no further after al-Hurr had recited this ayah to him, and he was a man who was careful to adhere to the Book of Allah. (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 4/304) This is how the Muslim should be. The evil hypocrite was not like this when he was told the hadith of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and one of the Companions said to him, &quot;Seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan.&quot; He said to the one who reminded him, &quot;Do you think I am crazy? Go away!&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 1/465). We seek refuge with Allah from failure. Knowing the bad effects of anger The negative effects of anger are many; in short they cause damage to ones own self and to others. The angry person may utter words of slander and obscenity, he may attack others (physically) in an uncontrolled manner, even to the point of killing. The following story contains a valuable lesson: `Alqamah ibn Wail reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) told him: &quot;I was sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when a man came to him leading another man by a rope. He said, O Messenger of Allah, this man killed my brother. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him, Did you kill him? He said, Yes, I killed him. He asked, How did you kill him? He said, He and I were hitting a tree to make the leaves fall, for animal feed, and he slandered me, so I struck him on the side of the head with an axe, and killed him. . . .&quot; (Reported by Muslim, 1307, edited by al-Baqi) Anger could lead to less than killing, such as wounding and breaking bones. If the one who caused the anger runs away, the angry person turns his anger on himself, so he may tear his clothes, or strike his cheeks, or have a fit, or fall unconscious, or he may break dishes and plates, or break furniture. In the worst cases, anger results in social disasters and the breaking of family ties, i.e., divorce. Ask many of those who divorced their wives, and they will tell you: it was in a moment of anger. This divorce results in misery for the children, regret and frustration, a hard and difficult life, all as a result of anger. If they had remembered Allah, come to their senses, restrained their anger and sought refuge with Allah, none of this would have happened. Going against the shariah (Islamic law) only results in loss. The damage to health that results from anger can only be described by doctors, such as thrombosis, high blood pressure, tachycardia (abnormally rapid heartbeat) and hyperventilation (rapid, shallow breathing), which can lead to fatal heart attacks, diabetes, etc. We ask Allah for good health. The angry person should think about himself during moments of anger If the angry person could see himself in the mirror when he is angry, he would hate himself and the way he looks. If he could see the way he changes, and the way his body and limbs shake, how his eyes glare and how out of control and crazy his behaviour is, he would despise himself and be revolted by his own appearance. It is well-known that inner ugliness is even worse than outer ugliness; how happy the Shaytan must be when a person is in this state! We seek refuge with Allah from the Shaytan and from failure. Du`a (Supplication) Du`a is always the weapon of the believer, whereby he asks Allah to protect him from evil, trouble and bad behaviour and seeks refuge with Him from falling into the pit of kufr (disbelief) or wrongdoing because of anger. One of the three things that can help save him is: being fair at times of contentment and of anger (Sahih al-Jami, 3039). One of the Du`as of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was: &quot;O Allah, by Your knowledge of the Unseen and Your power over Your creation, keep me alive for as long as You know life is good for me, and cause me to die when You know death is good for me. O Allah, I ask You to make me fear You in secret and in public, and I ask You to make me speak the truth in times of contentment and of anger. I ask You not to let me be extravagant in poverty or in prosperity. I ask You for continuous blessings, and for contentment that does not end. I ask You to let me accept Your decree, and for a good life after death. I ask You for the joy of seeing Your face and for the longing to meet You, without going through diseases and misguiding fitnah (trials). O Allah, adorn us with the adornment of faith and make us among those who are guided. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.&quot; For more about issues related to anger, please see these answers: 42505 , 22034 and 82400 . And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <question>Is a person married to another if they both say &quot;We accept each other as man and wife, having Allah as our witness,&quot; with no other witnesses present, and later having a celebration, telling everyone that they are married?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;There is no marriage without a wali (guardian) and two witnesses.&quot; (It is a saheeh hadith because of corroborating reports: Irwa al-Ghaleel, no. 1858). Imam al-Tirmidhi, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;The correct opinion is that narrated from Ibn Abbas, who said that there is no marriage without clear evidence Acting in accordance with that, the scholars among the Companions of the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) and the Taabieen and others who followed them said that there is no marriage without witnesses.

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah You have two options; Your first option is: The woman must be a chaste kitaabiyya (be among people of the book, i.e. Christian or Jewish), and in that case you can marry her following what Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;and chaste women among the believers and chaste women among those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians)&quot; Al-Maidah 4:5. The second option you have is that she converts to Islam and then you marry her. Otherwise, remember the hell fire, and remember what Allaah said in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And do not marry Al-Mushrikat ( idolatresses, etc.) until they believe ( worship Allaah alone). And indeed a slave woman who believes is better than a (free) Mushrikah (idolatress, etc.) even though she pleases you. And give not your daughters in marriage to Al-Mushrikoon until they believe (in Allaah alone) and verily, a believing slave is better than a (free) Mushrik ( idolater, etc.), even though he pleases you. They (Al-Mushrikoon) invite you to the Fire, but Allaah invites (you) to Paradise and Forgiveness by His leave, and makes His aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations) clear to mankind so that they may remember &quot;. Al-Baqarah, verse #2:221 The meaning of &quot;a slave woman who believes is better than a non-believer&quot; is simply that she is better than a non-believer who is (free) even if the non-believer pleases you, even if she pleases you, EVEN IF SHE PLEASES YOU! We ask Allaah to show you the truth, and to guide you back to it. May the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon the prophet Muhammad ).</answer>

    <title>Calling aathaan inside the masjid or prayer room</title>
    <question>Is it against the Sunnah to call the adhan inside the Musallah? I believe the way of the Salaf is to call it from the tallest structure/house near the masjid or the masjid itself.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. There is absolutely nothing wrong with calling the athaan in the musallah; on the contrary, it is better than abandoning it altogether. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught two men who were traveling how to make the call for prayer while traveling, where no mosques or musallahs may be found. As was narrated in the hadeeth saheah by Malik Ibn Al-Huwayrith: &quot;My cousin and I came to the Prophet SAWS and he said to us, If you travel, (meaning while you are traveling) perform the call for prayer, and call the iqamah before prayer and let the older one of you be the Imam.&quot; Narrated by Al Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari hadeeth #658 and Al Tirmidhi, hadeeth #189. According to Abu Eissa (Al Tirmidhi) this hadeeth is hasan saheeh. There were two views on the hadeeth. The majority of the Muslim scholars agreed on the validity of calling the aathaan while traveling. Others however, have said that the iqamah alone is sufficient, and that the purpose of the aathaan is to gather people for prayer. According to Ahmad and Ishaaq, the first view is more sound. In another Hadeeth narrated by Ukbah bin Aamir he said: I heard the Prophet say, &quot;Allaah is pleased by a shepherd who, while on the top of a mountain, calls for prayer and prays. Allaah the Almighty says, Look at my worshipperhe calls the aathaan, and he prays; he fears me. I have forgiven my worshipper, and I have sent him to heaven ( meaning that Allah chose for this person to go to heaven).&quot; Narrated by Al-Nisaai, Abu Dawood, and Ahmad and was confirmed sound by Al Albany in his book Saheeh Al-Jami, Hadeeth #8102. The benefits of the aathaan are many and they are by no means limited to gathering people, or announcing prayer time. They encompass: repelling Satan, getting rewarded in the afterlife for calling for prayer, and furthermore, for announcing and repeating the oneness of Allaah, etc. Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If the man has already donated the piece of land for building a mosque, then it should be used for that purpose, and he cannot go back on his donation. But if it is the case that all that has happened is a promise to donate land for a mosque, it is better for him to keep his promise. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions.</answer>

    <title>Muslim marrying a Catholic who doesnt convert to Islam</title>
    <question>Can a Muslim marry a Roman Catholic without the
   person converting to Islam?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If a Muslim wants to marry a Christian woman, she does not have to become Muslim first, because of the general statement in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): Made lawful to you this day are . . . chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time . . . [al-Maaidah 5:5]. The conditions for a non-Muslim woman to marry a Muslim man are that she should be of the People of the Book (Jewish or Christian) and that she should be chaste. We remind the Muslims living outside the Muslim world that they should not rush into taking such a step, and if they wish to do so, they should think long and hard, even though marrying a woman of the People of the Book is permitted in principle. There is a very real possibility of the children becoming Christian, especially in countries where the law favours the non-Muslim mother. In fact many such tragedies have occurred. We ask Allaah to guide us all and give us strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Punishment of the one who leaves Islaam</title>
    <question>I am currently in a philosophy of religion class and my teacher is an atheist. He claims that under an Islamic state if a born Muslim converts to another religion he is killed. Please tell me if this is true.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The punishment for apostasy (riddah) is well-known in Islaamic Shareeah. The one who leaves Islaam will be asked to repent by the Shareeah judge in an Islaamic country; if he does not repent and come back to the true religion, he will be killed as a kaafir and apostate, because of the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): &quot;Whoever changes his religion, kill him.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3017). It is well-known in Shareeah that the punishments (hudood) are not carried out on minors, because they have not yet reached the age of responsibility; but in the case of those who have reached the age of responsibility, the punishment (hadd) applies, without a doubt. The person who knows the truth and believes in it, then turns his back on it, does not deserve to live. The punishment for apostasy is prescribed for the protection of the religion and as a deterrent to anyone who is thinking of leaving Islaam. There is no doubt that such a serious crime must be met with an equally weighty punishment. If the kuffaar do not give people the freedom to cross a red light, how can we give freedom to people to leave Islaam and disbelieve in Allaah when they want to? It seems that the intention of the teacher mentioned in the question was to shock the students with news of this ruling, in order to mislead them from the way of Allaah. You must respond and explain to him and the other students as much as you can. May Allaah make you and us bearers of His Message and defenders of His Shareeah.</answer>

    <title>Cutting off ties with a non-Muslim sister</title>
    <question>I entered Islaam five years ago, and my family find it hard to accept. My sister cut off ties with me for a year, then she got in touch and asked me to forgive her, which I did. But she has not stopped insulting my Islaam and attacking me at every chance she gets. I told her several times that she is hurting me, but she didnt stop. After years of suffering, I sent her a letter telling me to contact me only if her attitude changed, otherwise, not to get in touch. Did I do the right thing?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Because of the insults that you suffered, there is nothing wrong with what you did, in sha Allaah. This would not be considered as &quot;breaking family ties&quot;, and it may give her the opportunity to think about what she has done. Al-Allaamah alSafaareeni, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his book Ghidhaa al-Albaab: &quot;Ibn Abi Hamzah said: The ties of kinship may be by money, by helping at times of need, by warding off harm, by meeting them with a smiling face, and by praying for them. The general meaning is that one helps them in good ways as much as possible and helps them to resist or fight evil as much as possible. This is the case if ones relatives are righteous, but if they are kaafirs or are wrongdoers, then cutting off ties with them for the sake of Allaah is how one maintains the tie, on the condition that one tries to warn them, and tells them that the reason for cutting the ties is because of their deviation from the truth. At the same time, the connection of making duaa for them should remain, and you should pray for them in their absence that Allaah will guide them to the Right Path. (al-Tuhfah: Ghidha al-Albaab, 1/356). And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <question>I am very interested in the Islamic religion. What can I do in order to convert to become a Muslim? I have always been in search of a religion that makes me feel closer to God, like Islam does. Why should I convert to Islam?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Benefits of converting to Islam How to convert to Islam You are always welcome Praise be to Allah.Benefits of converting to Islam It brought us great joy to hear from the noble inquirer expressing interest in accepting Islam. Islam is indeed the religion that links the human being to his Lord directly via the belief in the oneness of God and through various acts of worship. Also Islam instills peace of mind and an inner serenity to the created human being, embodied in a unique relationship and devout tranquillity, encompassing love for, fear of, hope from, and submission to God Almighty, Allah. Indeed, this essence is the true meaning of worship, which comprises and combines acts of the heart with acts of the tongue in remembering God, in addition to the acts of the physical organs. This is manifested through prayer, fasting, paying zakah (the poor due), and reading the Noble Quran, among other acts, which you will find resulting in positive and benevolent effects in yourself, God willing (in sha Allah). No doubt that if you decide to accept Islam that the conclusion which you will have reached was due to two things: (1) a sound mind and (2) success granted from God (Allah). How to convert to Islam As for converting to Islam, it is a very simple and easy thing, consisting of your pronouncing the two testimonies of faith. You will find the details regarding this as well as other relevant information in the answers to questions # , 179 , and 378 .

    <title>Breast-feeding a child over two years old</title>
    <question>Is it permissible to breast-feed a child over 2 years old? Until what age does breast-feeding make the child a relative (mahram)? Are there any exceptions to this rule?
I am asking because there are many 2 year olds in our area who need families - they need to be &quot;adopted&quot; in the Western sense. I would like to help these children, and expand our ummah, but too avoid hardship, I hope that there is a way that they could become relatives of my son.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Breast-feeding a child over two years old will not have the effect of making him a relative (mahram). It is permitted to breast-feed ones own child beyond two years, but two years is enough, as Allah says: &quot;The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling . . .&quot;[al-Baqarah 2:233] The reply to the rest of this question can be found under Question 804.</answer>

As information, In our country, the zinna can't punish with 'rajm'. I need your answer soon as possible.
Jazzakumullaahu khoiran katsiran.
Assalaamu'alaikum warahmatullaahi wabarakaatuh.</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.All Praises are Due to Allah The act that your friend committed is a great sin and crime. He must repent to Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;the eyes fornicate, the hands fornicate, the legs commit fornication, and the private parts commit fornication&quot;. (It is reported by Ahmad and it is in sahih Al Jahni 4150.) Tell your friend that he has to increase in good deeds so that Allah will wipe out his evil deeds, as Abdullah ibn Masud reported. He said that a man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said, Oh Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), I met a woman in the garden so I pulled her close, fondled her, kissed her, and did everything with except have intercourse. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was then silent and so the verse came down, &quot;verily, the good deeds erase the bad deeds, that is admonition to those who remember.&quot; So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called him and recited it to him. So Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, Oh Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is this for him specifically or for everyone. He said (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) , no, for everyone.' (It was narrated by Ahmad.) There are more details on repenting from fornication. Refer to question #624. As for your question regarding whether he is considered to have committed fornication, which is punishable by stoning, it is obligatory that the married fornicator be stoned and the unmarried fornicator receive lashes. This is only if the sexual organs of the fornicator penetrate the vagina of the woman. Whatever is similar deserves a different punishment, depending on the level of the haram committed. It is not obligatory that he admit to a judge what he did. It is sufficient that repentance take place between him and Allah, and Allah is the Acceptor of repentance and the Most Merciful. We ask Allah to forgive us and the rest of the Muslims. Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on reading    Soorat Yaa-Seen for the dying and the deceased</title>
    <question>In my culture people read sura Yaseen in groups before and after people die. I would like to know if whether this is based on suna or an innovation?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.We have to make a distinction here between the two issues: reading Yaa-Seen for one who is dying, and reading it for one who has died. With regard to reading Yaa-Seen for one who is dying, this practice has been reported from some of the Sahaabah. Imaam Ahmad reported in his Musnad from Safwaan: My shaykhs told me that they were with Ghudayf ibn al-Haarith al-Thumaani when he was dying. He said: Can any of you read Yaa-Seen? So Saalih ibn Shurayh al-Sakooni recited it, and when he reached the fortieth aayah, Ghudayf passed away. My shaykhs used to say that when it is recited in the presence of one who is dying, it eases the pain of death. That was the opinion of Safwaan. Eesaa ibn al-Mutamir read it for Ibn Mabad (when the latter was dying). (al-Musnad, 16355) Al-Albaani said in Irwaa al-Ghaleel, 3/152: This is a saheeh sanad going back to Ghudayf ibn al-Haarith, may Allaah be pleased with him. Its men are thiqaat apart from the shaykhs who are not named and are therefore unknown (majhool). But the fact that they are unknown is compensated for by their large number, especially since they are of the generation of the Taabieen Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen said in al-Sharh al-Mumti fi Ahkaam al-Janaaiz: Soorat Yaa-Seen may be recited over him (i.e., the one who is dying) for the one who thinks that the hadeeth is correct. He explained that this is because this soorah contains good news of Paradise, as in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): It was said: Enter Paradise. [Yaa-Seen 36:26], and because it makes the passage of the soul easier, and other reasons. As regards reading Soorat Yaa-Seen for one who has died, there is no saheeh hadeeth to indicate that this should be done. A hadeeth was narrated by Abu Dawood and others which says Read Yaa-Seen over your dead, but this hadeeth is not saheeh because its isnaad contains contradictions and narrators who are unknown (majhool). This was stated by al-Allaamah al-Albaani in Irwaa al-Ghaleel, hadeeth no. 688. Reading Quraan over the dead is considered to be bidah (innovation), as he states at the end of his book Ahkaam al-Janaaiz. Some people think that it should be read forty times over the deceased, and some of them may distribute copies of the Quraan among the mourners who gather to offer condolences so that they may read, or organize gatherings in the mosque to read it for the soul of the deceased. All of this has no basis whatsoever (in the sunnah), and these are innovated deeds of bidah which we should avoid and warn others against. And Allaah is the Source of strength.</answer>

I 'm asking this question because most of my friends do it and I didn't because I was never told. So please answer this question and don't leave it as joke.
Thank You</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah., We would never consider your question as a joke for the reason that you do what you are supposed to do by asking about something you dont know its ruling. At the age of our Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him) someone, called Abu-Refaa, may Allah be pleased with him, came to him while he was addressing his speech, and said. Oh Prophet a strange man came to ask about his religion for he knows nothing about it. Our Messenger came to me, as the man said, leaving his speech and sat on an iron chair, as I believe and start teaching me things he learned from Allah, then he completed his speech.(Narrated by Muslim - # 870) Hence, it is your right upon us to answer your question if we know its response Hair is divided into 3 parts: First: Hair that must be removed as the pubic region and the armpit. Second: Hair that must be leftover as it is such as mans beard. Third : Hair that we told nothing about and there is no legal text determines its remaining or its removal. (Though Allah doesnt forget anything in his Quran). This hair is left to you as you want to leave or remove and you are at liberty in that.

    <title>Wants to embrace Islam but has a girlfriend and children</title>
    <question>Hello, my
   name is XXXX, and I have decided to embrace Islam as my way of life..
   However my girlfriend and soon to be wife has embraced christianity for her way life and
   for our two children..
   I have no problem with her faith, but she always wants me to go to church with them, and
   sometimes I do to keep the peace. But I'm not sure how I should handle this reguest after
   I have become a muslim and have embraced Islam..    Can I still attend her church services's from time to time? How do I handle this dilemma..
   She seems to be supportive of my decision to embrace Islam, but Like many others including
   myself. Untill I did my own research and discovered this magnificent way of life. She's a
   bit apprehensive..
   Please guide me in the ways of Islam, so as not to hurt our family relationship..
   Thank you..</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.First of all, you should hasten to enter Islam, which is easy to do. An explanation of what is involved may be found under Question 114. (See also Questions 122, 158 and 177). Secondly, if this lady becomes a Muslim or one of the People of the Book (Christian or Jewish), repents to Allaah for the forbidden relationship, and remains chaste, then it is permissible for you to marry her. Thirdly, the children who were born to this woman outside of marriage are not your children; they cannot take your name and must take her name. However, this should not prevent you from treating them kindly, taking care of them and spending on them. In the future, you should try to call them and their mother to Islaam. Fourthly, going to her church and attending rituals of kufr is not advisable, because of the possible negative consequences. We advise you not to do that, but this should not be any obstacle to your entering Islam. If you were to say that it is a choice of either embracing Islam and going to the church with her, or not embracing Islam at all, we would definitely tell you to embrace Islam. But we would like you to think of the meaning of these two soorahs of the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meanings): &quot;Say: He is Allaah, (the) One. Allaah-us-Samad (The Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need; He neither eats nor drinks). He begets not nor was He begotten; And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&quot;[al-Ikhlaas 112:1-4] &quot;Say: O Kaafiroon (disbelievers in Allaah, in His Oneness, etc.)! I worship not that which you worship, Nor will you worship that which I worship. And I shall not worship that which you are worshipping. Nor will you worship that which I worship To you be your religion, and to me my religion (Islaamic monotheism).&quot;[al-Kaafiroon 109:1-6] Finally I advise you, a wise man who is striving to make the right choice, hasten to enter Islam and practise it: Allaah will help you to overcome all obstacles. May Allaah take care of you.</answer>

    <title>This is the essence of ribaa</title>
    <question>A person wanted to borrow money from one of the banks without paying interest, because interest is considered to be ribaa. But one of the managers in that bank told him: If you want to avoid ribaa, you can take a million from us, and one year later, if you can afford it, you can give us two million, one million which is due to us, and another million which we will keep for one year in return for the year during which you kept our million. After one year, you can take your million back. Is this considered to be ribaa or not? Please advise us, may Allaah reward you.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This is the essence of ribaa, and is not permitted under any circumstances, because the purpose of lending is to help Muslims. It was narrated from Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) that a loan is like an act of charity. If the bank lends you one million riyaals for a period of one year, and after that year passes you return the million that you borrowed and add another million for them to keep for a year in return for their loan to you, this is haraam according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Every loan which brings benefits is ribaa. (this version narrated by al-Baghawi). The bank lent you one million riyaals on the condition that you give them one million more than what is due to them, so that they can buy and sell with it and keep the profits for themselves. This condition brings benefits, so it is an invalid condition according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. All that you have to do is to give the bank the million that you borrowed from them, and not another million to benefit from for a year. This is not permissible according to the consensus of the Muslim scholars. The bank is not entitled to anything except getting its money back, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Be afraid of Allaah and give up what remains (due to you) from Ribaa (from now onward) if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allaah and His Messengerbut if you repent, you shall have your capital sums. Deal not unjustly (by asking more than your capital sums), and you shall not be dealt with unjustly (by receiving less than your capital sums). [al-Baqarah 2:278-289]</answer>

    <title>Why adultery, gambling and the flesh of swine are haraam</title>
    <question>Why are adultery, gambling, eating the flesh of swine forbidden in Islam or consedered &quot;haram&quot;?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Even though we find it strange that a Muslim would ask such a question about matters which are so clear and undisputed, the answer is simply that these things are haraam because Allaah, Whom we must obey, has forbidden them. He tells us in the Quraan (interpretation of the meanings): And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah (a great sin) and an evil way. [al-Israa 17:32] He has forbidden you only the maytatah (dead animals), and blood, and the flesh of swine [al-Baqarah 2:173] O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansaab [stone altars for sacrifice to false gods], and al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaans handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytaan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allaah and from al-salaah. So, will you not then abstain? [al-Maaidah 5:90-91] So we must avoid all that which Allaah has forbidden, out of faith in His laws, in the hope of His reward and in fear of His punishment. We must also believe that Allaah does not forbid anything in Islamic shareeah except that which is harmful and corrupt, whether we understand this rationally or not, because He says (interpretation of the meaning): And no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is not obligatory that zakat be paid on wealth until after the year ends. This refers to the $10,000. That is unless the additional money, which has come after the beginning of the year is a result and proceeds from the original money. This would make this money have the same zakat status, and you would then have to pay zakat on the entire $15,000. Also, see question #64 and question #101.</answer>

    <title>Yawning during prayer</title>
    <question>As salaam Alaikum....
I have a question in regards to prayer. I know that it is wrong to yawn during prayer. I've heard some reasons as to why people yawn during salaat, all of them having to do with shaytan. It seems that I always yawn when I pray. Is there an remedy by the Rasool  as to how to stop? And how wrong is it that I yawn? Jazak Allah Khayer</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. There follow a number of the Prophets teachings on this matter: Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Yawning is from the Shaytaan. If any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as possible, for if any of you says Ha (makes a noise when yawning), the Shaytaan laughs.&quot; (al-Bukhari no. 3289) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Allaah loves the act of sneezing and dislikes the act of yawning. If any one of you sneezes and praises Allaah, it is a duty on every Muslim who hears him to say Yarhamak Allaah (May Allaah have mercy on you). As for yawning, it is from Shaytaan, so if any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can, for if any of you yawns, the Shaytaan laughs at him.&quot; (al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 6226) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Yawning is from Shaytaan, so if any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can.&quot; (Muslim, 2994) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Sneezing is from Allaah and yawning is from Shaytaan. If any of you yawns, let him place his hand over his mouth. If he says Ah, ah! (makes a noise when yawning), Shaytaan laughs from inside him.&quot; Abu Eesaa said: this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 2746; classified as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 4130) Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Allah loves sneezing and dislikes yawning. If any one of you sneezes and says Al-hamdu Lillaah, it is a duty on everyone who hears him to say Yarhamak Allaah. As for yawning, if any one of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as he can, and do not say Hah, hah (do not make a noise when yawning), for this is from Shaytaan and he laughs at it.&quot; Abu Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hadeeth. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2747) Abu Saeed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;If any of you yawns, let him cover his mouth lest the Shaytaan enter.&quot; (Abu Dawud) Abu Saeed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;If any of you feels the urge to yawn, let him resist it as much as possible, lest the Shaytaan enter his mouth.&quot; (Imaam Ahmad) According to another report also narrated by Imaam Ahmad, Shaytaan enters when a person yawns. (Saheeh al-Jaami, 426) From the reports quoted above, we may summarize the following: 1. That Shaytaan prompts the human to yawn, which is indicative of laziness and sluggishness. 2. That Shaytaan enters the person who yawns. 3. That Shaytaan laughs at man and makes fun of his ugly appearance when he is in that state. The person who is praying must take care of the following: 1. He should resist yawning. 2. He should cover his mouth 3. He should suppress his voice (not make a sound). And Allaah knows best.</answer>

It indicates that you are affected by this great Islamic worship, which consists of abstaining from food and drink, and sexual intercourse from fajr (the break of dawn), until maghrib ( the sunset) during the day of the noble month of Ramadhan. As far as it's appointed time, my dear respected questioner, the laws of worship in Islam are scheduled according to proof which is clearly traceable and detectable. The evidence which is seen is not estimated. This entails the sighting of the moon, which indicates that the month of Ramadhan has begun. So, if we see the new moon, or it is established that someone amongst us has seen the new moon, then it becomes obligatory on the entire Muslim community to fast every day of this month, until we see the new moon for the following month of Shawwal and know that therefore Ramadhan has ended. The month of Ramadhan on the Islamic calendar could be 29 or 30 days depending on the sighting of the physical proof, which is the new moon. According to the Christian calender, the approximate time of Ramadhan this year would occur on the 30th or 31st of December 1997. In order for your fast to be correct and accepted, you must first enter Islam by testifying to Allah's Oneness and believing in the Prophet and following the laws of Islam. We would be happy to see you living a happy life with strong faith, and good years to come, spending them inspired by Islam. We ask Allah to protect you and guide you along.</answer>

    <title>Wants to accept Islam but fears for her mother's health</title>
    <question>I am not a muslim but have respect and faith for the religion. Though non-muslims are regarded as non-believers I do believe in ALLAH, but will not be able to convert because my mother, who is unwell, might not be able to bear losing her only daughter.I am in love with a muslim man and we want to get married. I have promised with my sincerest intentions that if we do get married and have children, they will follow Islam. Is there any way of us getting married without me converting and I would also appreciate if I could be told where I can read more on this subject. Thank You.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. To the noble inquirer: You have traversed an important part of the path to the truth and directing yourself towards it. From what I have been able to gather from your question, I understand that you wish to embrace Islam but what is preventing you from doing so is fear for your sick mother's health upon hearing the news. I want you to know that overcoming this obstacle is an easy matter, as it is possible for you in a practical way, to conceal your acceptance of Islam and not divulge it. You are not required to announce your acceptance of Islam in an Islamic center or anywhere else; all that is required is the pronouncing of the two testimonies of faith (see question(s) ) and the initiation of practicing the rites of the religion. You can pray in private, undisclosed places, for example. In addition, fasting will not be difficult as you can easily advance any appropriate excuse for not eating if something is offered to you during the daylight hours of the month of fasting. Now, I would like to remind you of two things: Firstly, that the driving factor and underlying truth regarding wanting to embrace the religion must be to gain the pleasure and acceptance of your Lord--Allaah, the Most Glorified and All-High, who does not accept any religion other than Islam, as He has said in his Glorious Book (the Qur'aan), [interpretation of the meaning]: &quot;And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam--it will never be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers.&quot; (The Family of Imran, verse 3:85) It has been narrated by Abu Hurairah, may Allaah be please with him, that Allaah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: &quot;By Him in whose hand Muhammad's soul is (i.e., God, Allaah), there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these present nations to whom I have been sent) who hears about me and then dies without believing in the message with which I have been sent (i.e. Islamic monotheism), but he will be among the dwellers of the Hellfire.&quot; (Sahih Muslim, Book of Faith, #240). Thus, your objectives in entering Islam are to save yourself from being among the permanent dwellers of Hell in the Hereafter, and to achieve the fantastic reward of the bliss of Heaven, the vastness of which is greater than that of the earth and the skies. Your overriding motive for accepting Islam should not be emotions stemming from your relationship with the Muslim man with whom you are in love. Your embracing Islam is something necessary for yourself whether you marry this man or not. Secondly, obeying God (Allaah) and His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has a higher priority than your closest relative and most beloved dear one even if it is your mother or your spouse or anyone else. The Prophet of guidance has said : &quot;There are three qualities, for which whoever is characterized by them will relish the sweetness of faith: one to whom Allaah and His Messenger are dearer than all else; one who loves a man only for Allaah's sake; and one who abhors returning to apostasy after Allaah has rescued him from it as he abhors being cast into Hell.&quot; (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book of Faith, #15). He also said: &quot;No worshipper (and in the hadeeth narrated by 'Abdul-Warith, no person) is a truthful believer, until I am dearer to him than the members of his household, his wealth and the whole of mankind.&quot; (Sahih al-Bukhari, Book of Faith #14). I ask Allaah to hasten you to Islam and to help you firmly establish yourself in it, and to grant you a righteous and successful marriage as well as a blessed family. Indeed, Allaah is the One who guides to the path of truth, success, and righteousness. Please see Subject area :Issues Relevant to New Muslims and Accepting Islam.</answer>

    <title>Holding two jumu'ah prayers in one place</title>
    <question>Can we organize two Friday prayers!? We do not have a mosque until now inside the campus--we ask you for doa'a... May Allaah help us to gain a permanent room. Due to different schedules of the university, students can not attend Friday Prayer which is scheduled at 1:00 p.m. Currently new Muslim brothers are asking if we can hold a second Friday arrangement on campus. Is it correct to host two Friday prayers in the same campus or same place!?
I personally am afraid [the reality is that it is] madhhab excuses, and different groups favour one time to another.I urge you to answer this question fast 
may Allaah reward you.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praise be to Allaah. After discussing the question you raised with the learned sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Abdullaah bin Baz, he has indicated that Islamic shari'ah does not legislate holding two jumu'ah prayers in one place. You should choose the most convenient time--and its timing extends until the 'asr prayer--and urge and enjoin all the Muslims to attend. Note that it is mandatory to stop all work (including attending classes) for the jumu'ah prayer. Whoever misses it would pray the dhuhr prayer. May Allaah grant you all success in obeying Him and pleasing Him and may He ease your affairs wherever you may be.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on wearing one&amp;#146;s clothes below one&amp;#146;s ankles</title>
    <question>Assalamu Alaikum
A brother was telling me that wearing clothing below the ankles is haram and that there are many hadiths that prove this. I would appreciate your opinion on this matter.
Jazakallah</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. What your friend has told you is true. Many ahaadeeth were reported from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) which forbid isbaal (wearing ones clothes below the ankles), for example: Al-Bukhaari reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whatever of the izaar (lower garment) is below the ankles is in the Fire.&quot; (al-Bukhaari, no. 5787) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;There are three whom Allaah will not look at or praise on the Day of Judgement and theirs will be a painful punishment: the one who wears his garment below his ankles, the one who reminds others of his favours, and the one who sells his product by means of making false oaths&quot; (reported by Muslim, no. 106) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Isbaal (wearing ones garment below the ankles) may apply to the izaar (lower garment), the shirt or the turban. Whoever allows any part of these to trail on the ground out of arrogance, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgement.&quot; (reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4085, and al-Nisaai, no. 5334, with a saheeh isnaad). Ibn Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Allaah will not look at the one who wears his lower garment below his ankles.&quot; (Reported by al-Nisaai in al-Mujtabaa, Kitaab al-Zeenah, Baab Isbaal al-Izaar). Hudhayfah said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) took hold of the muscle of my calf (or his calf) and said, This is where the izaar should stop; if you insist, it may be lower, but it should not reach the ankles.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said this is a saheeh hasan hadeeth; see Sunan al-Tirmidhi, no. 1783) All of the ahaadeeth quoted above speak against isbaal, whether or not the intention is to show off; but if a person does this deliberately out of arrogance, there is no doubt that his sin is greater. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Allaah will not look at the one who trails his izaar on the ground out of pride.&quot; (al-Bukhaari, no. 5788) Jaabir ibn Sulaym said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: Beware of wearing ones lower garment below the ankles, because this is a kind of showing-off, and Allaah does not love showing-off.&quot; (Regarded as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2722). No one is able to be completely free of pride and arrogance, even if he claims that this is so. Such a claim is unacceptable, because by saying it, he is praising himself. Only in the case of those whom the wahy (revelation) testified that they were free of pride do we believe that this is the case. For example, there is a hadeeth which states that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.&quot; Abu Bakr said to him, &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, my izaar slips down if I do not pay attention to it.&quot; He said: &quot;You are not one of those who do it out of pride.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, no. 5784) What indicates that isbaal is prohibited even if it is not done out of pride is the hadeeth of Abu Saeed al-Khudri, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The lower garment of the Muslim should come down to mid-calf, but there is nothing wrong if it is between that point and the ankles. Whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire. Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him.&quot; (Reported by Abu Dawud, no. 4093, with a saheeh isnaad.) These ahaadeeth describe two different deeds, for which there will be two different punishments: Imaam Ahmad reported that Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Yaqoob said: &quot;I asked Abu Saeed: Did you hear anything from the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) concerning the izaar (lower garment)? he said, Yes, listen! The izaar of the believer should come to mid-calf, although there is nothing wrong if it comes between there and the ankles, but whatever is lower than the ankles is in the Fire, and he said it three times.&quot; Ibn Umar said: &quot;I passed by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and my izaar had slipped down. He said, O Abdullaah, pull up your izaar! so I pulled it up. He said, More! so I pulled it up more, and always made sure it was pulled up properly after that.&quot; Some people asked, &quot;To where did you pull it up?&quot; He said, &quot;To mid-calf length.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 2086; al-Dhahabi, Kitaab al-Kabaair, 131-132) The issue of isbaal applies to women just as much as it applies to men. This is indicated by the hadeeth of Ibn Umar, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever trails his garment on the ground out of pride, Allaah will not look at him. Umm Salamah said: O Messenger of Allaah, what should women do with their hems? He said, Let them go down a handspan. She asked, What if their feet show? He said, Let them lengthen it by a cubit, but no more.&quot; (al-Nisaa'i, Kitaab al-zeenah, Baab dhuyool al-nisaa). The punishment for showing off may come to pass in this world, not in the Hereafter. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whilst a man was walking arrogantly admiring himself and his clothes, Allaah caused the earth to swallow him and he is suffering in it until the Day of Resurrection.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 2088).</answer>

    <title>What Benefits the Dead and Can They Hear Those Who Visit?</title>
    <question>My father passed away about two weeks ago. I wanted to know when me or my family members go to his grave, is he able to hear us and what we are saying to him? ... And if not, is there any way we can have him hear what we say?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Can the dead hear the living? What benefits the dead in Islam? Other deeds that may also benefit the dead Praise be to Allah.Can the dead hear the living? The principle is that the dead do not hear the words of the living, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;but you cannot make hear those in the graves.&quot; [Fatir 35:22] and &quot;Verily, you cannot make the dead to hear&quot; [al-Naml 27:80] When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) addressed the slain disbelievers after the Battle of Badr, Allah caused them to hear his words, although they were at the bottom of the well in which they had been buried. This was a special case, as the scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, have stated. (See Al-Ayat al-Bayyinat fi adam Sama al-Amwat). Perhaps the psychological motive for wishing that your father could hear you is an attempt to do something to re-establish the communication that has been cut, in order to alleviate the pain you are feeling. What benefits the dead in Islam? You should understand, my sister, that Islam has explained what actions on the part of the living may benefit the dead, and what may reach them in their graves. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;When a person dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: sadaqah jariyah (ongoing charity, e.g. a waqf or endowment), beneficial knowledge (which he has left behind), or a righteous child who will pray for him.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no 1376; he said this is a sahih hasan hadith) The most important thing that will benefit your father after his death, and that you can do for him now that he is in his grave, is to strive to pray for him and ask for forgiveness and mercy for him, and for Paradise and salvation from the Fire, and other good and beautiful du`as (prayers). Prayers for forgiveness offered by both sons and daughters of the deceased bring great benefits, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;A mans status will be raised in Paradise and he will ask, How did I get here? He will be told, By your sons duas (prayers) for forgiveness for you.&quot; (Reported by Ibn Majah, no 3660; see also Sahih al-Jami, 1617) Another thing that may reach the deceased is sadaqah (charity) given on his behalf, because `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): &quot;My mother has passed away, and if she could have spoken, she would have given something in charity. Will she receive a reward if I give something on her behalf?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 1388) Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the mother of Sad ibn Ubadah (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) died when he was away from her. He said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died and I am away from her. Will it benefit her anything if I give in charity on her behalf?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Then I ask you to be my witness that I am giving my garden al-Mikhraf (so called because it bore so many dates) in charity on her behalf.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 2756) Abu Hurayrah reported that a man said to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): &quot;My father has died and left money behind. He did not make a wasiyyah (a will); will it expiate for his sins if I give some of it in charity on his behalf?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes.&quot; (Reported by al-Nasai) Sa'd ibn Ubadah said: &quot;I said: O Messenger of Allah, my mother has died. Should I give charity on her behalf? He said, Yes. I asked, What kind of charity is best? He said, Providing water.&quot; (Reported by al-Nasai) Other deeds that may also benefit the dead Other deeds that may also benefit the deceased are Hajj and Umrah on their behalf, after the living person has first performed Hajj and Umrah on his or her own behalf. Abdullah ibn Buraydah reported that his father (may Allah be pleased with him) said: &quot;While I was sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), a woman came to him and said: I gave my mother a slave-woman in charity, and now my mother has died. He said: You have got your reward, and your right of inheritance has brought your gift back to you. She said, O Messenger of Allah, she still had one month to fast. Can I fast it on her behalf? He said, Fast it on her behalf. She said, She never went to Hajj. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf? He said, Perform Hajj on her behalf.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, may Allah have mercy on him, in his Sahih, no. 1149) This shows that it is also permissible to fast on behalf of the deceased. Another thing that may benefit the deceased is to fulfil their nadhr (vow), because Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that a woman came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: &quot;My mother made a vow to perform Hajj but she died before she could do it. Can I perform Hajj on her behalf?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes, perform Hajj on her behalf. Don't you think that if your mother owed a debt you would pay it off?&quot; She said, &quot;Yes.&quot; He said, &quot;Then pay off what is owed to Allah, for Allah is more deserving of having vows fulfilled.&quot; (al-Bukhari, al-Fath, 7315) Another thing that may benefit the deceased is if his relative devotes a share to him of a sacrifice he offers. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) offered a sacrifice, he said: &quot;In the name of Allah, O Allah, on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad&quot; (reported by Muslim, no. 1967) and the family of Muhammad included both the living and the dead. The question of whether women may visit graves has already been addressed (please see question# 127 ) You should also know that keeping yourself busy with praying for your father is more important and better for you, and more beneficial to the deceased, than thinking about whether he can hear your voice. So try to do whatever will be of benefit both to him and you. You and your family should avoid forbidden innovations (bidah) such as marking the fortieth day after death, or the passing of one year since the death, or gatherings for reciting al-Fatihah (the first chapter of surah of the Quran), doing forbidden acts at graves, and so on, deeds which are done by those who are ignorant and are imitated by others. I ask Allah to forgive your father and have mercy on him and on all the deceased Muslims, for He is the Forgiving, Most Merciful. For more, please see these answers: 9979 , 43138 , and 9304 .

    <question>would you please answer the following question, asked by my none-Muslim coworker.
On top of this, the Egyptians had a fairly standardized code of punishment, which was generally followed. The punishment for treachery was to have the tongue cut off, blasphemy was one hundred beatings. If a crime was committed, it was formally charged and punished, it was not a heat of the moment thing. To me this is a problem of logical inconsistency in the Qur'an. Could someone please rationally explain this for me.
David &quot;
I really need the answer to his question ASAP please,</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. The problem lies in that your friend is a kafir (non-believer) who believes in what the archeologists say more than in what Allaah the Most Exalted says. The only solution is that this friend of yours realizes and believes that the One who created Moses, the magicians, the Pharaohs, and the Persians, knows them better, and knows every minute detail in their lives and all the events that occurred to them, than anyone else. And tell this friend of yours, who claims that he has read the story of Moses and the Pharaoh: Doesnt Allah the Most Exalted say in the Quraan, with regards to the dialogue that took place between Moses and the Pharaoh (interpretation of the meaning): Firaun (Pharaoh) said: &quot; What about the generations of old (previous generations)? Musa (Moses) said : &quot; The knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a Record. My Lord is neither unaware nor does He forget Verses # 51-52, surat Ta-ha.

    <title>Does Touching Wife Break Wudu?</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on touching the wife and the status of wudu? Does touching the wife cause breaking of wudu?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.In this issue, the strongest of the statements of the scholars is that touching the wife does not break the wudu, unless there is a discharge of sperm. This is the statement of Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) and it is also from Ali bin Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) as well as Hasan, Mujahid, and Qatadah. It is also of the madhhab of Abu Hanifah. Ibn Jarir supports this statement, as well as At-Tabari and Sheikh Al-Islam ibn Taimiyyah. The people who support this statement, use as proof the hadith of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said, &quot;I was sleeping in front of the Messenger of Allah and my legs were in his qiblah. When he prostrated he touched me and I withdrew my legs, and when he stood I stretched them out&quot;. (Homes in those days did not have lamps.) (Al-Bukhari,328) They also use the hadith where `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) says, &quot;I noticed the Messenger of Allah was gone one evening from the bed, so I looked for him and my hand landed on the sole of his feet and he was in the mosque. They were close together and he was saying, &quot;O Allah I seek refuge with You, pleasure from Your anger, and with Your pardon, and from Your punishment. I seek refuge with You from what is falsely attributed to You as praise. You are how You have praised Yourself&quot;. (Muslim, 486) An-Nawawi states in explaining this hadith that `Aishas statement, &quot;and my hand landed on the soles of his feet when he was in the mosque and they were close together,&quot; is proof for the one who says that touching the wife does not break wudu. Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taimiyyah says the statement of Allah, &quot;Or ye have been in contact with women&quot; refers to sex as Ibn Abbas and others from the Arabs have said. It is reported by Ali and others, and it is the correct meaning of the verse. There is nothing showing that touching one's wife breaks wudu in the Quran or Sunnah. The Muslims used to touch their wives all the time and not one of the Muslims reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) ordered anyone to make wudu because of touching women .

    <title>Sects in Islam and influence by other religions</title>
    <question>How many sects are there in the Muslim religion and how are each beliefs differ from the others?
Also, how was Islam influenced by other religions in the Middle East?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. The one and only religion that Allaah, the Most Gracious, accepts is Islam. This religion has one path, one direction and is based on one methodologythat which the Prophet of Islam Muhammad (peace be upon him) followed along with his comrades. This religion which Allaah has chosen for mankind is not subdivided into different sects nor does it divert into different paths. However, a number of people have gone astray and corrupted the religion, forming many different groups that bear no relation to Islam, examples of which are Al-Baatiniya,, Al-Qadyaninya, and the Bahaaiya, among which Allaah the Most Exalted and Glorious has warned us in the Holy Quraan: &quot; And verily this (i.e. Allahs commandments mentioned in the previous two verses 151 and 152) is my straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al- Muttaqoon ( the pious-see V2:2) &quot; Verse # 153, Surat Al Anaam. As for the second part of the question, the noble inquirer must know that Islam came down from the heavens in the form of divine revelations and inspirations to the Prophet (peace be upon him). Islam is the religion that Allaah has accepted for his worshippers, and has chosen it to mark the final completion of all that preceded it and thus supercede and be the seal for all religions. Therefore, it is not possible to say that Islam was influenced by other religions (as it was revealed by God, Allaah, the Almighty). We hope that you will read more about this religion and we ask Allaah to guide you to the True Path.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.al-hamdu lillaah. If the Imam ascends the mimbar and greets the audience with the salaam then the audience should respond. This would not be considered frivolous discourse and would not violate the silence required for listening because the actual khutbah has not yet begun. Therefore, until then, the audience can recite praises of Allaah and duaa, and also repeat after the muathin who calls for prayer, which is timed after the Imam has actually greeted the audience and has taken his place on the mimbar.</answer>

    <title>Dealing with hurtful relatives</title>
    <question>This is regarding family matters and disputes.
I have a maternal uncle who creates alot of trouble for my family. His wife and children have even went to the limits of taking my mother to court, and falsely bearing witness that she physically assaulted them and threatened to kill them. There are numerous things they do, but, my uncle after a few months fights with his children and comes back and asks my mother for forgiveness. She forgives him, and he starts pretending he is a maskeen. But, he continues to support his children and wife who hurt my mother numerously.
Anyway, I asked my mother, NOT to talk to him anymore. She claims we have to forget and forgive. But, surely there are limitations. Anyway, is it wrong to ask my mother, not to associate with him anymore. Is it wrong for me to continue to refuse to have anything to do with him or his family. I DO NOT wish to forget or forgive, especially, when there is no change in his behavior.
Any Advice is appreciated.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. If you want to deal with him on the basis of justice, then it is permissible for you to respond in like to his unkind words, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And if you punish (your enemy), then punish them with the like of that with which you were afflicted&quot; [al-Nahl 16:126]. But if you bear it with patience, that will be better for you, as Allaah says at the end of the same aayah (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for al-saabireen (the patient ones).&quot; [al-Nahl 16:126] If you want to turn enmity into love, then treat him well, if he treats you badly, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one which is better, then verily! He between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as though he was a close friend.&quot; [Fussilat 41:34] The words, &quot;The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal&quot; mean that there is a huge difference between the two. &quot;Repel (the evil) with one which is better,&quot; means that when someone treats you badly, answer back with something better, as 'Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;There is no better punishment for the person who sinned by being bad to you, than your obeying Allaah by being good to him in return.&quot; (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, I have relatives with whom I try to keep in touch, but they cut me off; I treat them well, but they treat me badly; I try to be kind to them, but they are cruel to me.&quot; He said: &quot;If you are as you say, it is as if you are putting hot ashes in their mouths. You will continue to have support from Allaah against them so long as you continue doing that.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 2558) Our advice to you, our sister, is to be tolerant and forgiving. Follow your mother's advice. It is clear from your question that this man has room to regret and retract his bad actions. Allaah tells us (interpetation of the meaning): &quot; whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his reward is due from Allaah&quot; [al-Shoora 42:40] However, all of this does not prevent us from protecting ourselves from the evil and harm that such relatives may cause. If going to their houses, for example, will cause some kind of offence or harm, then the relationship can be limited to telephone calls, kind words, the occasional gift and so on. The relationship can be maintained at a distance, if being too close will cause problems. We ask Allaah to guide us all, to help us not to bear any grudges towards anyone, and to treat one another properly. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>What to do with a Guide Dog when entering a Mosque</title>
    <question>Assalaam alaikum
I am desiring to embrace Islam, however I have a slight concern. I am legally blind and use a guide dog for mobility purposes. I have been informed that I have no problems being a Muslim and having a guide dog due to my disability. However, I am concerned at the reaction that I get from other Muslims when I approach an Islamic Center. I do not want to offend but without the assistance of the guide dog I am unable to travel to a Masjid or Islamic center alone. With who should I discuss this situation i.e., an Imam? I sometimes feel I am at a &quot;stalemate&quot; . Thank you for your help.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. (All praise be to God Almighty, Allaah.) To the dear noble inquirer: You have reached the doorstep of entering into Islam and are hesitant due to concern over what you may face vis--vis the response of fellow Muslims regarding the dog you use to guide you to the masjid or Islamic center. Let me assure you that the matter is simple and much easier to deal with than you may think. You are a man for whom Allaah has ordained blindness as a trial, and there is little or no practical recourse for your daily movement, coming and going, other than a trained guide dog. Whereas keeping a dog without due need is censured and objectionable according to Islamic shariah (due to its filth and uncleanness), in your case keeping a dog is clearly for an urgent need and not out of custom, tradition, or love for owning the dog itself. So perhaps you have a valid excuse regarding this issue, Allaah willing. I cant imagine that you would require to enter the mosque or Islamic center with the dog; rather, you most likely would leave him outside and enter for worship, attending a religious gathering, or to learn and ask about matters concerning your religion. As long as the case is as such, the issue is solved and the matter is settled. If you leave the dog at a distance from the entrance to the mosque, then whoever among the Muslim does not welcome you warmly would clearly be committing a mistake. You could also contact the director of the Islamic center or whoever fills such a position, in order to explain to him your situation. I would expect him to assume the responsibility for informing those who administer as well as attend the mosque. If you like, feel free to take this response as a letter to him and ask him to peruse it, and I am confident you will find only goodwill and cordiality, Allaah willing. In closing I would like to welcome you to the religion of Islam and send you a warm salutation and an extraordinary congratulations on your desire to accept the religion. I urge you to hasten in taking the greatest step of your life since your mother gave birth to you, and would like to leave you with glad tidings regarding the disability with which you are afflicted. In fact, you will receive a great reward for your blindness if you accept Islam, as per the saying of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) [translation of the meaning]: &quot;Verily Allaah has said, If I afflict one of My worshippers with a trial regarding his two dearest ones (i.e., his eyes) and he is patient and perseveres, I will compensate him for them Heaven. &quot; (Hadeeth al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari #5653) We ask Allaah to open your heart to the truth and to assist you in holding fast to it, and Allaah is the One Who Guides to the true path of righteousness.</answer>

    <title>Uncertain of the number of breast-feedings</title>
    <question>My question is about marriage. I want to marry a cousin because we are very deeply in love. But we heard that I got some milk from her mother. Then we wondered how many times this had happened. When we asked her mother, she said, &quot;I dont remember - it is so long ago.&quot; So she does not remember how many times she may have given me milk. I do not know what I should do in such a situation.
But one thing I know very well is that I love her very much! Please advise me.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. For breast-feeding to have the effect of making a child a relative (mahram), two conditions must be met: (1) The number of breast-feedings should be five or more, because of the hadith of Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who said: &quot;When the Quran was first revealed, the number of breast-feedings that would make a child a relative (mahram) was ten, then this was abrogated and replaced with the number of five which is well-known.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 1452). (2) This should happen within the first two years of the childs life, because of the hadith: &quot;Harmalah ibn Yahya told us that Abdullah ibn Wahb told us that Ibn Lahimah informed us from Abu al-Aswad from Urwah from Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr that the Messenger of Allah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be Upon Him) said: &quot;There is no breast-feeding except what fills the stomach to bursting point.&quot; (Reported by Ibn Maajah, no. 1946; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 7495). Al-Bukhaari, may Allah have mercy on him, included a chapter in his Saheeh entitled: &quot;The chapter of the one who says there is no breast-feeding after two years because of the words of Allah . . . two whole years, (that is) for those (parents) who desire to complete the term of suckling . . . [al-Baqarah 2:233].&quot; The definition of radah (one breast-feed) is that the child should take the breast and drink milk from it, then leave it of his own accord in order to breathe or to change position, and so on. If this is the case, then the rulings concerning breast-feeding will apply, i.e. the child will be considered a relative and marriage will be forbidden, etc. In the case of doubt concerning the number of breast-feedings, Ibn Qudaamah, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;If there is some doubt concerning whether breast-feeding took place, or concerning the number of feeds and whether it was enough to make the child a relative (mahram) or not, then there is no proof that the child must be considered a relative, because the general rule of life is that a child does not breast-feed from anyone except his own mother, and one cannot dismiss certainty in favour of doubt. (al-Mughni 11/312). Therefore it is permissible to marry if there is no proof of breast-feeding that would make the individual concerned a relative. I do not want to omit reminding the one who asked this question that we are obliged to adhere to the Shareeah no matter where it leads us, and our desires and emotions should not prevent us from following the truth. The Muslim must remain chaste and avoid all kinds of &quot;love relationships.&quot; He must strive to protect himself by marrying in a proper fashion according to Islamic shareeah.</answer>

    <title>Why death is the punishment for Apostasy</title>
    <question>Alslamualik
This question has bees asked several time from non-Muslims and I want to find an answer: Why When the Muslim convert to another religion(Murtad) he/she should be killed?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Your question may be answered by the following points: (1) This is the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whoever changes his religion, kill him.&quot; (reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3017). (2) The one who has known the religion which Allaah revealed, entered it and practised it, then rejected it, despised it and left it, is a person who does not deserve to live on the earth of Allaah and eat from the provision of Allaah. (3) By leaving Islaam, the apostate opens the way for everyone who wants to leave the faith, thus spreading apostasy and encouraging it. (4) The apostate is not to be killed without warning. Even though his crime is so great, he is given a last chance, a respite of three days in which to repent. If he repents, he will be left alone; if he does not repent, then he will be killed. (5) If the punishment for murder and espionage (also known as high treason) is death, then what should be the punishment for the one who disbelieves in the Lord of mankind and despises and rejects His religion? Is espionage or shedding blood worse than leaving the religion of the Lord of mankind and rejecting it? (6) None of those who bleat about personal freedom and freedom of belief would put up with a neighbours child hitting their child or justify this as &quot;personal freedom,&quot; so how can they justify leaving the true religion and rejecting the shareeah which Allaah revealed to teach mankind about His unity and bring justice and fairness to all? We ask Allaah for safety and health. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad .</answer>

    <title>Conditions for valid marriage contract</title>
    <question>What is the correct Islamic procedure for a marriage ceremony, I mean if two Muslims are married (legally) without the presence of a religious &quot;person&quot; (like imam etc.), does that mean the marriage is non-existent in terms of Islam?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All praise is due to Allaah. A marriage contract is valid in Islam if the following conditions are met, even if the marriage does not take place in a court, or in the presence of a Judge or the Imaam of the masjid. In addition, it does not need to be written. The waliy (guardian) of the girl has accepted the proposal by saying, for example, &quot;I marry you my daughter&quot;, and the one who proposed has replied, for example, by &quot; I accept,&quot; or &quot;I am satisfied&quot; (i.e. with his acceptance). This takes place in the presence of two witnesses The woman is legally eligible to marry the man according to Islamic shari'ah (that is she is not a Mahram of the proposer [those to whom the proposer is forbidden to marry. etc.]) Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>What should a person who borrowed with interest(Ribba) do?</title>
    <question>Salam Brother, My question is; how does one purify himself or his place of business from things that may have occurred prior to knowledge that it was haram? For example, I own clothing stores, but have financed this business via moneys borrowed and paid interest upon. To this day I am using a bank where I have a loan and pay interest on it. Also in the past I had a business that did not succeed, and was forced into bankruptcy, which meant that there were many people and businesses that were left unpaid, what is my Islamic duty in that case? I did make a sincere effort to pay all that I could but after the business went bad was not able to repay them.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is wajib that you repent for each loan involving interest you took. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed all involved in the interest, the recipient, the sponsor, and the one eating and the feeding it, as stated in the authentic hadith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, &quot;The gold for the gold, the silver for the silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, date for date, salt for salt, similar for the like, and hand in hand. So whoever adds or seeks to add, then he has used riba. The recipient and the giver of the transaction are the same&quot;. (Reported by Muslim, #1584.) On the authority of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) &quot;cursed the one who consumes interest, the one giving it, the one bearing scroll, and the two witnesses to it&quot;. He said (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), &quot;they are all equal.&quot; (Muslim narrated it.) If a Muslim wants to partake in a specific affair and he doesn't know it's ruling, then it is upon him to ask before he gets involved in it. Ignorance isn't an excuse for each and every situation. As far as the loans you borrowed, you are obligated to return the initial money borrowed only. If you are forced to pay riba, and that is the added amount with no way out, then we hope that you do your best in repenting to Allah to pardon you. We also hope that you remain consistent in your business and give sadaqa with what you are able to, in order to purify yourself and your wealth. We ask Allah to enrich us with His halal and to avoid His haram.</answer>

    <question>Why is it forbidden to sleep on ones belly? Is it forbidden for both men and women?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The reason for this is that it was forbidden by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who left no good thing but he told us about it and left no evil thing but he warned us against it. Yaeesh ibn Tihfah al-Ghifaari reported that his father said: I stayed as a guest with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with those of the poor whom he hosted. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out in the night to check up on his guests, and saw me lying on my stomach. He prodded me with his foot and said, Do not lie in this manner, for it is a way of lying that Allaah hates. According to another report, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) prodded him with his foot and woke him up, and said, Do not lie like this, for this is how the people of Hell lie. (Reported by Ahmad, al-Fath al-Rabbaani, 14/244-245; by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2798, Shaakir edn.; and by Abu Dawood, al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Adab, no. 5040, al-Daaas edn. Also reported in Saheeh al-Jaami, 2270-2271) This is a general prohibition that applies to both males and females, because the basic principle is that rulings apply to both sexes, except in cases where it is indicated that there is a differentiation between the two.

    <title>Adaab UlSharab (drinking manners)</title>
    <question>I am in sixth grade and am studying Islam. I am currently working on a report on the Arabian coffee ceremonies, and want to know more about the subject.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praises are Due to Allah Drinking coffee is a custom and not from the laws of Islam. If drinking coffee in excess becomes dangerous to the individual, then Islam prohibits it. There are no ceremonies in Islam for coffee drinking nor is drinking coffee from the particular customs of the Muslims, since Muslims as well as non-Muslims drink coffee. There are however specific manners in the Islamic law concerning drinking in general. From amongst them are the following: Drinking with the right hand. To say Bismillah before you begin to drink. Drinking at least three sips or more and not drinking the entire drink at once. To praise Allah after finishing the drink. To drink sitting down. The person giving the drink to others should drink last. The person passing out the drinks should start on his right hand side when distributing the drinks. An individual should not drink from the pitcher, but instead pour some of the drink into a dish or cup, and then drink. A person should not drink from gold or silver dishes. Your question dear young man and the information you provided indicates that you are without a religion and this is wrong because the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated that you were born as a Muslim and that this is your origin as well as others besides you. This is the case, until something happened to you to change that, such as other incorrect religions like Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, or Magianism. Return back to your true origin, read about Islam, and establish prayer. I see that you have sufficient wit and intelligence to know the truth and implement it. I ask Allah to guide you and open your heart to Islam.</answer>

    <title>Is It Haram to Shave Your Legs?</title>
    <question>I would like to know what the ruling is concerning Muslim women shaving their legs. The legs are not one of the areas mentioned in the hadeeth about things which are consistent with the fitrah.
Does this mean that it is haram for women to shave them? Maybe it would also be haram as an imitation of the unbelievers. However, a woman may want to do it in order to please her husband. What do the scholars say about this issue?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.It is permitted to remove the hair of the legs. Islamic schools of thought say that a woman may remove all her body hair , such as that on the arms or legs, if removing it will increase her beauty, but she must leave whatever makes her beautiful, so she is forbidden to shave the hair on her head. (Al-Mawsuah al-Fiqhiyyah, 18/100) The woman is also forbidden to remove the hair on her face , especially plucking the eyebrows , because the promised punishment for doing that is clearly stated.</answer>

    <title>Who Are the Angels?</title>
    <question>What do you believe about angels regarding their function, appearance, form and powers?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of belief Who are the Angels? Of what are the Angels created? When were the Angels created? The great size of Angels Description of Angels Angels have wings Beauty of the Angels The Angels do not eat or drink Number of Angels Names of Angels Power of Angels Speed of Angels Duties of Angels Praise be to Allah.Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of belief Belief in angels is one of the six pillars of faith without which there is no faith. Whoever does not believe in any of these pillars is not a believer (mumin). These pillars are belief in: Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and that predestination, both good and bad, comes from Allah. Who are the Angels? Angels are a part of the world of the Unseen which we cannot comprehend. Allah has told us about them in many places in the Quran and via His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). There follows a number of proven reports concerning the angels, which hopefully will make you realize the greatness of the Creator and the greatness of this religion which has told us so much about them: Of what are the Angels created? They are created from light, as Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The angels are created from light, just as the jinn are created from smokeless fire and mankind is created from what you have been told about.&quot; [Muslim]. When were the Angels created? We have no knowledge of precisely when they were created, because there is no text to tell us this. But they were created before mankind for certain, because the Quran says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Behold, your Lord said to the angels: I will create a vicegerent on earth.&quot; [2:30] The fact that Allah told them of His intention to create man indicates that they already existed. The great size of Angels Allah says concerning the angels of Hell: &quot;O you who believe! Save yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern and severe, who flinch not (from executing) the commands they receive from Allah, but do (precisely) what they are commanded.&quot; [66:6] The greatest of all the angels is Jibreel, upon whom be peace, who was described in the following report: &quot;From Abdullah ibn Masood (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Jibreel in his true form. He had six hundred wings, each of which covered the horizon. There fell from his wings jewels, pearls and rubies, only Allah knows about them.&quot; It was reported by Ahmad in al-Musnad, and Ibn Katheer said in al-Bidayah that its isnad (chain of narrators) is jayyid (good). The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing Jibreel: &quot;I saw Jibreel descending from heaven, and his great size filled the space between heaven and earth.&quot; [Muslim]. Among the greatest angels are those who carry the Throne (of Allah), who were described in the following report: &quot;From Jabir ibn Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who said: I have been given permission to speak about one of the angels of Allah who carry the Throne. The distance between his ear-lobes and his shoulders is equivalent to a seven-hundred-year journey.&quot; [Abu Dawood]. Description of Angels Angels have wings Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Praise be to Allah, Who created (out of nothing) the heavens and the earth, Who made the angels messengers with wings - two, or three, or four (pairs) adds to Creation as He pleases: for Allah has power over all things.&quot; [35:1] Beauty of the Angels Allah said, describing Jibreel, upon whom be peace (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;He [the Prophet] has been taught by one Mighty in Power, Dhoo Mirrah (free from any defect in body and mind), then he rose and became stable.&quot; [53:5-6] Ibn Abbas said: &quot;Dhoo Mirrah means that he has a beautiful appearance.&quot; Qutadah said: &quot;He is tall and beautiful.&quot; The idea that angels are beautiful is firmly established in all peoples minds, so much so that they liken a beautiful human to an angel, as the women said about Yoosuf: &quot;. . . When they [the women] saw him, they did extol him and (in their amazement) cut their hands: they said: Allah preserve us! No mortal is this! This is none other than a noble angel!&quot; [12:31] The differences in size and status of the Angels The Angels are not all of one size or status; there are differences between them just as there are differences in virtue. The best of them are those that were present at the battle of Badr, as is stated in the hadeeth narrated by Muadh ibn Rifaah al-Zuraqi from his father, who had been one of the people present at Badr. He said: &quot;Jibreel came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) and asked, How do you rate the people among you who were present at Badr? He said: They are the best of the Muslims, or something similar. [Jibreel] said: So it is with the angels who were present at Badr.&quot; [al-Bukhaari]. The Angels do not eat or drink This is indicated by the conversation between Ibrahim, the &quot;friend&quot; of Allah, and the angels who visited him. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Then he turned quickly to his household, brought out a fatted calf, and placed it before them. He said, Will you not eat? (When they did not eat), he conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not, and they gave him glad tidings of a son endowed with knowledge.&quot; [51:26-28] Elsewhere, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;But when he [Ibrahim] saw their hands went not towards the (meal), he felt some mistrust of them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: Fear not: we have been sent against the people of Lut.&quot; [11:70] The Angels do not get bored or tired of remembering and worshipping Allah Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;They celebrate His praises night and day, nor do they ever slacken.&quot; [21:20] &quot;. . . For in the presence of your Lord are those who celebrate His praises by night and by day. And they never become tired (nor feel themselves above it).&quot; [41:38] Number of Angels The angels are many, and their number is known only to Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, describing the Much-Frequented House (al-Bayt al-Mamoor) in the seventh heaven: &quot;Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them.&quot; [al-Bukhaari]. Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Hell will be brought forth that day by means of seventy thousand ropes, each of which will be pulled by seventy thousand angels.&quot; [Muslim]. Names of Angels The angels have names, but we know only the names of a few of them. We have to believe in the names reported in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings) texts, as a part of general belief in the angels. Among the names of angels that are known to us are: (1) Jibreel and (2) Mikail &quot;Say: Whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allahs will, a confirmation of what went before, and guidance and glad tidings to those who believe - Whoever is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and prophets, to Jibreel and Mikail - Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject faith.&quot; [2:97-98] (3) Israfil From Abu Salamah ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, who said: &quot;I asked Aishah, the Mother of the Believers, about what the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to start his prayer with when he got up to pray at night (qiyam al-layl). She said: When he got up to pray at night, he would start his prayer (with the words): O Allah, Lord of Jibreel, Mikail and Israfil, Creator of heaven and earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You are the Judge of the matters in which Your slaves differ; guide me with regard to disputed matters of truth by Your permission, for You guide whomever You will to the straight path.&quot; [Muslim]. (4) Malik He is the Keeper of Hell, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;They [the people in Hell] will cry: O Malik! Would that your Lord put an end to us!&quot; [43:77] (5) Munkar and (6) Nakeer From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, What did you used to say about this man? and he says what he used to say: He is the slave and Messenger of Allah: I bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the slave and Messenger of Allah. They say, We knew beforehand that you used to say this. Then his grave will be widened for him to a size of seventy cubits by seventy cubits and it will be illuminated for him. Then they tell him, Sleep. He says, Go back to my family and tell them. They tell him, Sleep like a bridegroom whom no-one will wake up except his most beloved, until Allah raises him up. If (the deceased) was a hypocrite, he says, I heard the people saying something so I said something similar; I do not know. They say: We knew beforehand that you used to say this. The earth will be told to squeeze him, so he will be crushed until his ribs are interlocked, and he will remain like that until Allah raises him up.&quot; [al-Tirmidhi]. (7) Haroot and (8) Maroot Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;. . . and such things as came down at Babylon to the angels Haroot and Maroot . . .&quot; [2:102] &quot;. . . and none can know the forces of your Lord, except He. And this is nothing other than a warning to mankind.&quot; [74:31] Power of Angels The angels have great powers given to them by Allah, including the following: The ability to take on different forms. Allah has given the angels the ability to take on forms other than their own. Allah sent Jibreel to Maryam in the form of a man, as Allah says: &quot;. . . Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her as a man in all respects.&quot; [19:17] Angels also came to Ibrahim in human form, and he did not know that they were angels until they told him so. Similarly, angels came to Lut in the form of young men with beautiful faces. Jibreel used to come to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) in different forms: sometimes he would appear in the form of Dihyah al-Kalbi, a sahaabee (companion) who was very handsome, and sometimes in the form of a Bedouin. The sahaabah (companions) saw him in his human form, as is reported from Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) in the two Saheehs Al-Bukhari and Muslim). (Umar) said: &quot;One day while we were sitting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), there appeared before us a man whose clothes were exceedingly white and whose hair was exceedingly black; no signs of travel were to be seen on him, and none of us knew him. He walked up and sat down by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Resting his knees against his and placing his hands on his thighs, he said: O Muhammad, tell me about Islam....&quot; [ Muslim]. Many other ahadeeth (report) refer to the angels taking human forms, such as the hadeeth (report) about the one who killed a hundred, in which it says &quot;. . . there came to them an angel in human form . . .&quot; and the hadeeth about the blind man, the bald man and the leper. Speed of Angels The greatest speed known to man today is the speed of light; the angels are able to travel much faster than this. Hardly had an enquirer completed a question to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), but Jibreel would bring the answer from Allah. Duties of Angels Among the angels is one whose task it was to convey the revelation from Allah to His Messengers; this is al-Rooh al-Ameen, Jibreel, upon whom be peace. Allah says: &quot;Say: whoever is an enemy to Jibreel - for he brings down the (revelation) to your heart by Allahs will. . . &quot; [2:97] &quot;Which the trustworthy spirit has brought down, Upon your heart, that you may be (one) of the warners.&quot; [26:193-194] Another is responsible for rain, directing it wherever Allah wishes. This is Mikail, upon whom be peace. He has helpers, who do what he tells them, by the command of his Lord; they direct the winds and clouds, as Allah wills. Another is responsible for blowing the Trumpet, which will be blown by Israfil at the onset of the Hour (the Day of Judgement). Others are responsible for taking peoples souls: these are the Angel of Death and his helpers. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Say: the Angel of Death, put in charge of you, will (duly) take your souls, then shall you be brought back to your Lord.&quot; [32:11] There is no proof in any saheeh hadeeth (authentic report) that his name is Azrail. Others are responsible for protecting the slave throughout his life, when he stays home and when he travels, when he is asleep and when he is awake. These are the &quot;angels in succession&quot; concerning whom Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day. For each (person), there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the Command of Allah. Verily! Allah will not change the good condition of a people so long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves (by committing sin and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allah). But when Allah wills a peoples punishment, there can be no turning back of it, and they will find besides Him no protector.&quot; [13:10-11] Others are responsible for recording the deeds of man, good and bad. These are the &quot;honourable scribes&quot; (kiraman katibeen) and are referred to in the ayat/verses (interpretation of the meanings): &quot;. . . and He sends guardians (angels guarding and writing all of ones good and bad deeds) over you . . .&quot; [6:61] &quot;Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes, We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record.&quot; [43:80] &quot;(Remember!) that the two receivers (recording angels) receive (each human being after he or she has attained the age of puberty), one sitting on the right and one on the left (to note his or her actions). Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).&quot; [50:17-18] &quot;But verily, over you (are appointed angels in charge of mankind) to watch you, Kiraman (honourable) katibeen - writing down (your deeds).&quot; [82:10-11] Others are responsible for testing people in the grave. These are Munkar and Nakeer. From Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When the deceased is buried (or he said: when one of you is buried), there come to him two blue-black angels, one of whom is called Munkar and the other Nakeer. They ask him, What did you used to say about this man? . . .&quot; [The hadeeth is quoted in full above] Some of them are the keepers of Paradise. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And those who kept their duty to their Lord will be led to Paradise in groups, till, when they reach it, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: Salamun alaikum (peace be upon you!). You have done well, so enter here, to abide therein.&quot; [39:73] Some of them are the keepers of Hell, the &quot;guards of Hell&quot;, whose number is nineteen and whose leader is Malik, upon whom be peace. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened. And its keepers will say, Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the verses of your Lord, and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours? They will say: Yes, but the word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers!&quot; [39:71] &quot;Then, let him call upon his council (of helpers), We will call the guards of Hell (to deal with him)!&quot; [96:17-18] &quot;And what will make you know exactly what Hell-fire is? It spares not (any sinner), nor does it leave (anything unburnt)! Burning the skins! Over it are nineteen (angels as guardians and keepers of Hell). And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire, and We have fixed their number only as a trial for the disbelievers - in order that the People of the Scripture may arrive at a certainty and the believers may increase in faith . . .&quot; [74:27-31] &quot;And they will cry: O Malik (Keeper of Hell)! Let your Lord make an end of us. He will say: Verily you shall abide forever.&quot; [43:77] One of the angels is responsible for the sperm in the womb, as is mentioned in the hadeeth (report) of Ibn Masood (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), whose truthfulness is confirmed, said: The way that each of you is created is that he is gathered in his mothers womb for forty days as a sperm drop, and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot, and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then an angel is sent and he breathes the spirit into (the foetus), and is charged with four commands: to write down his provision, his life-span, his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy. By the One besides Whom there is no other god, one of you may do the deeds of the people of Paradise until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Hell, so he will enter Hell; and one of you may do the deeds of the people of Hell until he is just a cubit away from entering it, then his fate will overtake him and he will begin to do the deeds of the people of Paradise, so he will enter Paradise.&quot; [al-Bukhaari, Muslim]. Some angels carry the Throne of Allah, as He describes in the Quran (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Those (angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah) and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah) (saying): Our Lord! You comprehend all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save them from the torment of the blazing Fire!&quot; [40:7] Some of the angels travel throughout the world, seeking out gatherings of dhikr (remembrance of Allah). Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said: Allah, be He blessed and exalted, has angels who travel the highways seeking out the people of dhikr. When they find people remembering Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, they call out to one another, &quot;Come to what you hunger for!&quot; and they enfold them with their wings, stretching up to the lowest heaven. Their Lord asks them, and He knows better than them, &quot;What are My slaves saying?&quot; They say: &quot;They are glorifying, magnifying, praising and extolling You.&quot; He asks, &quot;Have they seen Me?&quot; They say, &quot;No, by Allah, they have not seen You.&quot; He asks, &quot;And how would it be if they saw Me?&quot; They say, &quot;They would be even more fervent and devoted in their praise and worship.&quot; He asks, &quot;What are they asking me for?&quot; They say, &quot;They ask You for Paradise.&quot; He asks, &quot;And have they seen it?&quot; They say, &quot;No, by Allah, O Lord, they have not seen it.&quot; He asks, &quot;And how would it be if they saw it?&quot; They say: &quot;They would be even more eager for it and they would beseech You even more earnestly.&quot; He asks, &quot;And what do they seek My protection from?&quot; They say, &quot;From the Fire of Hell.&quot; He asks, &quot;Have they seen it?&quot; They say, &quot;No, by Allah, they have not seen it.&quot; He asks, &quot;And how would it be if they saw it?&quot; They say: &quot;They would be even more afraid and anxious to escape it.&quot; Allah says: &quot;You are My witnesses that I have forgiven them.&quot; One of the angels says: &quot;So-and-so is not really one of them; he came (to the gathering) for some other reason.&quot; Allah says, &quot;They were all in the gathering, and one of them will not be excluded (from forgiveness).&quot;&quot; [al-Bukhaari]. Some of them are responsible for the mountains. Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): &quot;Have you ever faced any day more difficult than the day of Uhud?&quot; He said: &quot;I suffered at the hands of your people and the worst that I suffered was what I suffered at their hands on the day of Aqabah. That was when I went to call Ibn Abd Yalayl ibn Abd al-Kalal to Islam, and he did not respond. I left, feeling depressed and hardly knowing where I was going. I did not recover until I found myself in Qarn al-Thaalib. I raised my head and saw that I was being shaded by a cloud. I looked, and saw Jibreel in the cloud. He called me and said: Allah has heard what your people said and how they responded to you. He has sent the Angel of the Mountains so that you can tell him to do to them whatever you want. The Angel of the Mountains called me and greeted me, then said: O Muhammad, tell me what you want me to do. If you want, I can crush them between two mountains. &quot;The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;All I hope for is that Allah will bring forth from their loins people who will worship Allah alone and not associate any partner with Him.&quot; [al-Buhaari]. Some of them visit the Much Frequented House (al-bayt al-mamoor). In the lengthy hadeeth describing the Isra and Miraj (the Night Journey and the Ascent to Heaven), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;Then I was taken up to the Much-Frequented House: every day seventy thousand angels visit it and leave, never returning to it again, another [group] coming after them.&quot; There are also angels standing in rows, who never get tired or sit down, and others who bow or prostrate, and never raise their heads, as was reported by Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: I see what you do not see and hear what you do not hear. The heaven makes a noise like groaning, and it has the right to (or it is no surprise), for there is no space in it the width of four fingers, but there is an angel there, placing his forehead in sujood (prostration) to Allah. By Allah, if you knew what I know, you would laugh little and weep much, you would not enjoy your relationships with women and you would go out in the street praying to Allah.&quot; [ al-Tirmidhi] This is a summary of Islamic teachings concerning the noble angels of Allah. We ask Allah to make us believe in them and love them. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

    <title>Ruling on operations to repair the hymen</title>
    <question>For some reason a woman tore her hymen. Is it permissible for her to have it repaired surgically?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. This matter is one of the issues that have been raised in the modern age, so we should look at each of the two scholarly opinions on the matter and indicate which one we believe to be more correct. The first opinion is that it is not permissible to repair the hymen at all. The second opinion is more detailed: 1.If the rupture of the hymen was caused by an accident or by an action that is not considered in shareeah to be a sin, and was not caused by intercourse within the bounds of legal marriage, then we look at the following issue: If it is deemed most likely that the girl will suffer hardship and unfair accusations because of the customs and traditions of her society, then doing this operation is obligatory. If that is not the case, then it is still better to do the operation. 2.If the rupture was caused by intercourse within the bounds of legal marriage, as in the case of woman who has been divorced, or by zinaa (illicit sexual activity i.e., outside the bounds of marriage) in a case that is well known among the people, then it is haraam to do this operation. 3.If the rupture was caused by zinaa in a case that is not well known among the people, then the doctor has the choice of either repairing it or not repairing it, although it is better to repair it. The points on which the scholars differ The differences between these two opinions are confined to the first and third cases outlined above. With regard to the second case, they are agreed that this operation in haraam in such situations. Evidence (daleel) The evidence for the first view (that it is completely haraam). Firstly: repairing the hymen could lead to mixing of lineages, as a woman could become pregnant from a previous liaison, then she gets marriaed after having her hymen repaired, which then leads to the pregnancy being attributed to her husband, thus mixing halaal with haraam. Secondly: repairing the hymen involves looking at that part of the awrah which is to hidden most. Thirdly: repairing the hymen makes iteasy for young women to commit the sin of zinaa, because they know that they can have the hymen repaired afterwards. Fourthly: there is the matter of good and bad consequences, or pros and cons. If it is possible to achieve the good consequences whilst warding off the bad consequences, then we should do that. If the bad consequences outweigh the good consequences, we should ward off the bad consequences and not worry about the good consequences, as the fuqahaa of Islam have stated. If we apply this principle and look at the evil consequences that result from repairing the hymen, we will understand that it is not permissible to do this operation because of the enormity of the evil consequences that result from it. Fifthly: one of the principles of Islamic shareeah is that something harmful cannot be removed by something else that is also harmful. One of the implications of this principle is that it is not permissible for a man to prevent his land from being flooded by diverting the flood waters onto someone elses land. By the same token, it is not permissible for a girl and her mother to remove harm from themselves by having the hymen repaired and thus causing harm to the husband. Sixthly: the basic idea of repairing the hymen is not permissible according to shareeah because it is a kind of deceit, and deceit is forbidden in Islam. Seventhly: repairing the hymen pavest he way for girls and their families to tell lies about the real reason why the hymen was ruptured, and lying is also forbidden in Islam. Eighthly: repairing the hymen paves the way for doctors to resort to performing abortions for the purposes of concealing sin. Evidence for the second opinion: Firstly: the texts indicate that it is permissible and is encouraged to conceal sins, and repairing the hymen helps to achieve that in cases where this operation is permissible. Secondly: if a woman who is innocent of any immoral action is allowed to have this operation so as to leave no room for suspicion, this will ward off unjustice for her and will achieve the aim prescribed by shareeah of thinking well of believing men and women. Thirdly: repairing the hymen has to ward off harm . If a woman was left without having this operation done, and her husband were to notice that, it would cause trouble for her and her family, and if the matter became well known among people, the family may never be able to find marriage partners for their daughters. So they are permitted to ward off harm because they are innocent in this case. Fourthly: the fact that a Muslim doctor may perform this operation in order to conceal the illusionary evidence of has a general educational impact on society, especially where the psychology of young women is concerned. Fifthly: the objection of deception does not exist in cases where we have determined that it is permissible to repair the hymen. Which view is more correct? The view which is more correct- and Allaah knows best  is that which states that it is not permissible to repair the hymen at all. This is for the following reasons: Fisrtly: because the reports quoted as evidence by those who have this view are saheeh. Secondly: with regard to the evidence quoted by those who favour the second view, they may be dealt with as follows: The response to the first : The concealing that is required in Islam is that described in the texts as a concealing of sin, but this aim is not achieved by repairing the hymen. Basically it is haraam because it involves uncovering the awrah and opens the door to evil. The response to the second : Preventing the husband from thinking badly of the woman may be achieved by informing him of the situation before marriage. If he accepts it, this is fine, otherwise Allaah will compensate her with someone better. The response to the third : The evil consequence mentioned cannot be avoided entirely by doing this operation, because there is the possibility that the husband may find out about it, even if that happens by way of someone else telling him. He should be told about it, and if he accepts then the evil consequence is not longer an issue, as is also the case if he decides not to go ahead with the marriage. The response to the fourth : Even though there are some positive aspects to this concealment, there are also negative consequences, such as making it easy for women to commit zinaa. Warding off evil consequences takes priority over gaining benefits. The response to the fifth : We do not accept that there is no deception involved, because this hymen is renewed, it is not the original hymen. If we accept that there is no deception of the husband involved in cases where the hymen was broken as a result of jumping and so on, we cannot be sure that there is no deception in cases where it was broken as a result of an attack on the woman. Secondly: blocking the routes that could lead to harm, as mentioned by those who favour the first opinion, is a very important matter, especially in cases that have to do with the violation of the sanctity of private parts and the evil that can undoubtedly result from permitting the repair of hymens. Thirdly: the basic principle in Islam is that it is haraam to uncover, touch or look at that which is awrah. The excuses mentioned by those who favour the second opinion are not strong enough to let operations to repair the hymen be exempted from this general rule. So we have to adhere to this ruling, and say that it is haraam to do operations to repair the hymen. Fifthly [sic]: the evil consequence of false accusations being made can be dealt with by obtaining a medical certificate after the event to prove the womans innocence. This is the best way, and by doing this there is no longer any need to do an operation to repair the hymen. For all of these reasons, it is not permissible for a doctor or a woman to do this kind of surgery, and Allaah knows best. (See Ahkaam al-Jaraahah al-Tibbiyyah wal-Athaar al-Mutarattibah alayhaa by Dr. Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Mukhtaar al-Shanqeeti, p. 403) Some contemporary scholars have issued fatwas stating that surgery to repair the hymen is permissible in the case of rape victims and those who have repented (from zinaa), but it not permissible in the case of women who have not repented, because this is helping her to continue committing that sin. By the same token, a woman who has previously had intercourse is not permitted to do this operation because this is helping her to deceive and cheat a future husband, since he will think that she is a virgin when this is not the case. And Allaah knows best</answer>

    <question>I am a 21yr-old young man and inshallah next year I will be getting married.
My question is that, i need to know the way a marriage is set to be planned. I mean how is the nikah supposed to be performed, how many people can i invite? Is there a limit? Can I have music, dancing during my wedding or during reception or walima?
Also I need to know whose responsibility is it to conduct the nikah and walima? Is it the brides, or the bride grooms?
I need to know the answer a.s.a.p. so I could inform my family and inshallah I will implement it in my life, so Allah will bless me and my marriage.</question>
    <answer>Contents Related How to consummate marriage in Islam Is there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast? Music in a wedding ceremony: Haram? Praise be to Allah.How to consummate marriage in Islam When a Muslim wants to consummate his marriage , a number of things are recommended in the sunnah: He should treat his bride kindly and gently, like offering her something to drink and so on, because of the hadith narrated by Asma bint Yazid ibn al-Sakan, who said: I prepared Aishah as a bride when she married the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). I came to him and invited him to see her (uncover her face). So he came and sat beside her, and a large cup of milk was brought to him. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drank some, then offered it to her, but she lowered her head and felt shy. I rebuked her and said: Take it from the hand of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). So she took it and drank a little, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to her, Give some to your companion (meaning himself). (Reported by Imam Ahmad and deemed sahih by al-Albani) He should place his hand on his brides head and pray for her, saying Bismillah and asking for barakah (blessing), saying the words reported in the hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-As, who said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: When one of you marries a woman or buys a servant, let him say: Allahumma inni as-aluka khayraha wa khayra ma jabaltaha alayhi wa audhu bika min sharriha wa min sharri ma jabaltaha alayhi (O Allah, I ask You for her goodness and the goodness which You have created in her, and I seek refuge with You from her evil and the evil which You have created in her). Abu Dawud said that Abu Said added: Then let him take hold of her forelock and pray for blessing from this woman or servant. (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Nikah, Bab fi jami al-nikah; classed as hasan in Sahih al-Jaami, no. 341) He should pray two rakahs with her, leading her in prayer, because this is reported as being the practice of the salaf (early generations). There are two reports concerning this. (i) from Abu Said, the freed slave of Abu Usayd, which states that a group of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) taught him and told him: When your wife comes in to you, pray two rakahs and ask Allah for the goodness of what has come to you, and seek refuge with Him from its evil. (ii) from Shaqiq, who said: A man called Abu Hariz came and said (to Abdullah ibn Masud, may Allah be pleased with him): I have married a young virgin girl, but I am afraid that she may hate me. Abdullah said: Love comes from Allah and hatred comes from Shaytan, who wants to make you hate what Allah has made permissible. When she comes to you, tell her to pray two rakahs behind you. (These two reports were narrated by Ibn Abi Shaybah; see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani). When he wants to consummate the marriage , he should say the words reported in the hadith reported by Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) who said: When one of you wants to approach (have intercourse with) his wife, if he says: Bismillahi Allahumma jannibna al-Shaytan wa jannib al-Shaytan ma razaqtana (In the name of Allah, O Allah, protect us from Shaytan and protect whatever You give to us from Shaytan)  then if they are given a child, Shaytan will not harm it. (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, no. 3271) (For more information, see Adab al-Zafaf by al-Albani, p. 91) Is there a limit to the number of guests in a wedding feast? There is no limit to the number of guests one can invite to a wedding feast (walimah), so invite whoever you wish of your relatives, the brides relatives, your friends and anyone you have a good reason to invite. Music in a wedding ceremony: Haram? It is not permitted in Islam to do anything that is haram such as having music , letting men and women mix, or letting women dance in front of men, or other things that earn the wrath of Allah. How can the blessing of Allah be exchanged for disobedience and immorality? At weddings , women can do whatever is allowed in Islam, such as singing acceptable songs with good words or entertaining themselves by playing the daff (a certain kind of drum, resembling a tambourine without the rattles) only, so long as no men are present. Who should give the wedding walimah? Providing the wedding feast (walimah) is the husbands responsibility . The sunnah is to slaughter one sheep or more for the guests, if he is able to, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, Give a wedding feast, even if it is only one sheep. (Reported by al-Bukhari, al-Fath, no. 2048). We ask Allah to bless you and your bride and to grant you a happy marriage. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Wants to embrace Islam but there are no Muslims Town</title>
    <question>I am very interested in learning more about and embracing the religion of Al-Islam. My problem is that I live in an area that has no Muslim community at all. No places of worship, no study groups, nothing. What is the best way for me to get started learning what I should know?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Al hamdulilah As soon as you have come to know, dear noble inquirer, that Islam is the true religion of righteousness and the straight path, you should hasten to embrace it and begin practicing the Islamically-prescribed obligations, such as the prayer, etc. Your earning to learn about Islam is a wonderful thing for which you should be commended. Your unfortunate complaint regarding the absence of a helpful surrounding and a righteous environment is certainly a valid one and to a degree a problem; however, this obstacle no doubt can be overcome by the will of Allaah. For example there are several pages on the Internet that you can use to gain knowledge and benefit. You can also correspond to the various Islamic organizations and publishing houses to get valuable and informative books about Islam. There may be an Islamic center in your town or in a nearby town that you can go to, even if only once a month, to get to know your fellow Muslim sisters and to get advice from them and work with each other in enjoining righteousness and good deeds. Perhaps you can use the internet as an avenue to find out the addresses of Islamic centers in any particular city or state. If it is possible for you to move to a city where there is a Muslim community or an Islamic center which adheres to true, mainstream Islam (followers of the Sunnah and the united Islamic community), this would be very good. If, in the worst case, may Allaah forbid, lets suppose you don't find even a single Muslim about you, this would not ever prevent you from holding fast to the religion of Islam. In Islam you have an ever-persistent relationship with your Lord; you worship Him and talk to Him and ask Him guidance, support, and aid in adhering to His religion; you feel His company and security by your prayers to Him your seeking refuge in Him--to an extent that will compensate you more than the absence of anybody else, and will allay your loneliness and the inability to meet fellow sisters in faith and religion. Consider the situation of the followers of our beloved Prophet (peace be upon him) who embraced Islam at its inception. They remained alone and estranged among their tribes and people, each one worshipping Allaah from his place until the Prophet migrated to al-Madinah, at which time they migrated with him and supported him in establishing the Islamic state. We ask Allaah for your guidance and for you to reply quickly to the call of Allaah and his Prophet (peace be upon him), and we wish you happiness in this life and the hereafter.</answer>

    <title>Blood spots that appear prior to Menstruation</title>
    <question>Before my menstrual period I spot for about five days . I would like to know can I pray and fast ? I know already that after my menstrual period if I'm spotting then I should pray but this is before starting my period.</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.Al-hamdu lillaah. If yellowish or brownish secretions and red blood spots appear regularly before and after your period then they are considered part of your period so long as the total number of days does not exceed 15 days. Consequently, you cannot pray nor fast during this time. Yet if your period actually stops and the secretions appear after 1 or more days after your period has ended then these secretions are not considered part of the menstruation. In which case you can fast and pray, as you are considered in a state of istihaadah not menstruation, but you will need to perform ablution for each prayer, after the athaan (prayer call) or corresponding time has come.

    <title>Bid'ah Hasanah (&quot;Good Innovations&quot;)</title>
    <question>I have a question in the area of what is and isn't Bidaa. Over and over again I hear people terming certain actions as Bidaa. I am however confused. Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't there a hadith by Prophet Muhammed (SAW) that says that anyone who introduces a new helpful hadith will be rewarded. If this is true, then why are all new inovations frowned upon.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Firstly, we should know what &quot;bid'ah&quot; means according to Islamic teaching. It is defined as: any invented way in religion that is aimed at worshipping or drawing closer to Allaah. This means anything that is not referred to specifically in Sharee'ah, and for which there is no evidence (daleel) in the Qur'aan or Sunnah, and which was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions. At the same time, it is quite obvious that this definition of religious inventions or innovations, which are condemned, does not include worldly inventions [such as cars and washing machines, etc. - Translator]. If your confusion has to do with an apparent contradiction between the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah and the hadeeth narrated by Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, then let us examine these two reports and find out what they mean: Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah al-Bajali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing and is followed by others, will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their reward in any way. Whoever starts a bad thing and is followed by others, will bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting from their burden in any way.'&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 2675. He said, This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth) There is a story behind this hadeeth, which will explain what &quot;whoever starts a good thing&quot; means. Imaam Muslim reported this story from Jareer ibn 'Abdullaah, who also narrated the hadeeth itself. He said: &quot;Some people from the Bedouin came to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), wearing woollen garments. He saw that they were in bad shape and in desperate need, so he urged the people to give them charity. They people were very slow to respond, and it could be seen in his face (that he was upset). Then a man of the Ansaar brought a package of silver, then another came, and another and another, and his face was filled with joy. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts a bad thing in Islam, and others do likewise after him, there will be written for him a burden of sin like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden.'&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 1017) Further explanation may be found in a report recorded by al-Nisaa'i, also from Jareer ibn 'Abdullah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: &quot;We were with the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) early one day, when some people who were almost naked (not dressed properly) and barefoot, with their swords by their sides, came to him. Most, if not all of them, were of (the tribe of) Mudar. The Messenger's face changed when he saw how poor they were (i.e., he became upset). He went into (his house), then he came out and ordered Bilaal to give the call to prayer. He led the people in prayer, then he addressed them, saying: 'O people, &quot;be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person, and from him He created his wife, and from them both he created many men and women, and fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship)&quot; [al-Nisaa' 4:1]. &quot;Fear Allaah, and keep your duty to Him. And let every person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow&quot; [al-Hashr 59:18]. Let a man give charity from his dinars, his dirhams, his clothing, his wheat or his dates - even if it is only half a date.' A man from the Ansaar brought a package which he could hardly carry in his hand, then another and another came, until there were two piles, of food and clothing, and I saw the face of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) beaming with joy. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts a good thing in Islam will have his own reward and a reward equal to that of those who follow him, without it detracting in the least from their reward, and whoever starts a bad thing in Islam will have to bear the burden of his own sin and a burden equal to that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Mujtaba: Kitaab al-Zakaat, Bab al-Tahreed 'ala al-Sadaqah). From the context of the story, it is clear that what is meant by the words &quot;whoever starts a good thing (sunnah hasanah) in Islam&quot; means: Whoever revives a part of the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or teaches it to others, or commands others to follow it, or acts according to it so that others see him or hear about it and follow his example. This is also indicated by the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: &quot;A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and he urged the people to give him charity. A man said: 'I have such-and-such,' and there was no person left in the gathering who did not give something in charity to him, whether it was a large amount or a little. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever starts something good, and others follow his lead, will have a complete reward and a reward like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their reward. Whoever starts something bad, and others follow his lead, will bear a complete burden of sin, and a burden like that of those who followed him, without it detracting in the least from their burden. (Reported by Ibn Maaajah in al-Sunan, no. 204) It should be clear from the above, with no room for doubt, that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was not allowing innovation in matters of deen (religion), nor was he opening the door to what some people call &quot;bid'ah hasanah,&quot; for the following reasons: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated repeatedly that: &quot;Every newly-invented thing is a bid'ah (innovation), every bid'ah is a going astray, and every going astray will be in the Fire.&quot; (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Sunan, Salaat al-'Eedayn, Baab kayfa al-Khutbah). Reports with the same meaning were narrated via Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ahmad, via al-'Irbaad ibn Saariyah by Abu Dawud and via Ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ibn Maajah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to say, when beginning a khutbah (sermon): &quot; The best of speech is the Book of Allaah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst of things are those which are newly-invented, and every innovation is a going astray&quot; (reported by Muslim, no. 867) If every bid'ah is a going astray, how can some people then say that there is such a thing in Islam as &quot;bid'ah hasanah&quot;? By Allaah, this is an obvious contradiction of the statement and warning of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) stated that whoever innovates something new in the deen (religion) will have his deed rejected, and Allaah will not accept it, as is stated in the hadeeth narrated by 'Aa'ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'Whoever innovates something in this matter of ours that is not a part of it will have it rejected.'&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, no. 2697). How can anybody then say that bid'ah is acceptable and it is permitted to follow it? When a person innovates something and adds to the deen something that does not belong to it, he is implying a number of bad things, each worse than the last, for example: That the religion is lacking, that Allaah did not complete and perfect it, and that there is room for improvement. This clearly contradicts the statement in the Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&quot; [al-Maa'idah 5:3] That the religion remained imperfect from the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the time when this innovator came along and completed it with his own ideas. That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was &quot;guilty&quot; of either of two things: either he was ignorant of this &quot;good innovation,&quot; or he knew about it but concealed it, thus letting his ummah down by not conveying it. That the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), his Companions and the righteous salaf (early generations) missed out on the reward of this &quot;good innovation&quot; - until this innovator came along and earned it for himself, despite the fact that he should say to himself, &quot;If it was truly good, they would have been the first to do it.&quot; Opening the door to bid'ah leads to changing the deen (religion) and opens the way for personal whims and opinions, because every innovator implies that what he is introducing is something good, so whose opinion are we supposed to follow, and which of them should we take as a leader? Following bid'ah leads to the cancelling out of sunnah practices and the ways of the salaf. Real life bears witness that whenever a bid'ah is followed, a sunnah practice dies out; the reverse is also true. We ask Allaah to save us from the misguidance of personal whims and from all trials whether they are open or secret. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Working in a riba-based (interest-based) bank</title>
    <question>Aslamoaliakum.
I have been offered a job at a Bank, and I am not sure whether I should work there or not, because the bank makes money from interest (Riba). Please tell me whether working there is allowed (Jaaiz), or not.
jazaakum-Allah-khair.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. You will find the answer in the hadeeth of Jaabir, may Allaah be pleased with him, who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah cursed the one who consumes riba (interest or usury), the one who gives it, the one who writes it down and the one who witnesses it. He said: 'All of them are equal in sin.'&quot; (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his Saheeh, no. 1598) Commenting on this hadeeth, al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: This is clearly a prohibition of the writing down or witnessing of a contract between the two parties involved in a riba-based deal. It also includes a prohibition of helping others to commit wrong acts. And Allaah knows best. It is inevitable that the employee in a riba-based bank will play a part in riba dealings one way or another, even if he is just a security guard. Maybe Allaah will help you, my brother, if you are patient, to find halaal employment. (Interpretation of the meaning) &quot; And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).&quot; [al-Talaaq 65:2]</answer>

    <question>I am looking for the hadith that gives reference to the Ansar women appearing as crows after the verse 33:59 was revealed. It was my understanding that this was considered as proof that black as a color for hijaab was Sunnah, and therefore mustahab. Could you tell me where I could find this hadith, and    include its volume and number please?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.The hadeeth to which you refer was narrated by Abu Dawood, may Allaah have mercy on him, in al-Sunan, from Umm Salamah who said: When the aayah  to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies [al-Ahzaab 33:59  interpretation of the meaning] was revealed, the women of the Ansaar came out looking as if there were crows on their heads, because of their clothing. (Sunan Abi Dawood, Kitaab al-Libaas, Baab fi qawlihi taaala: yubneena alayhinna jalaabeebihinna). The author of Awn al-Mabood fi Sharh Sunan Abi Dawood said, commenting on this phrase: Their veils were likened to crows because of their black colour. However, it is not a condition of hijaab that the clothes should be black, but it may be better because it is more concealing. For the conditions of Muslim womans hijaab, please refer to question #214.</answer>

    <title>Vinegar in which there is a percentage of alcohol</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on selling live chickens by weight, and on selling vinegar in which there is 6% alcohol?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Firstly, it is permissible to buy chicken by weight. This is the basic principle and we do not know of any evidence (daleel) to the contrary. Secondly, it was reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a small amount of it is haraam. (Narrated by Ahmad in al-Musnad, 2/91, 167, 179; 3/343). If the vinegar would cause intoxication in large amounts, then a little of it is haraam, and it comes under the same ruling as wine. If a large amount of it does not cause intoxication, then there is no reason not to sell it, buy it or drink it.</answer>

    <title>Those whom Allaah will shade with His shade</title>
    <question>What i want to know is that: What kind of people will be included into the &quot;shade&quot; of the chair which Allah (s.w.t) will be sitting, when the sun is brought closer to the earth. I hope i am phrasing the question right.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Seven of those whom Allaah will shade with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His were mentioned in the saheeh ahaadeeth. It was reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There are seven whom Allaah will shade with His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His: the just ruler; a young man who grows up worshipping his Lord; a man whose heart is attached to the mosque; two men who love one another for the sake of Allaah and meet and part on that basis; a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty and says I fear Allaah; a man who gives in charity and conceals it to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives; and a man who remembers Allaah when he is alone, and his eyes fill up. (Agreed upon, narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 620; Muslim, no. 1712; and others). This is one of the blessings that Allaah bestows upon His believing slaves. On the great Day when mankind will be suffering distress and hardship,the sun will be brought near to mankind, until the distance between them is equal to the length of the stick used for applying kohl to the eyes [meel= may also mean a mile], and all the people will sweat according to their deeds, except for some of the believers, whom Allaah will single out to shade them with His shade, and He will protect them from the sun and from sweating. Uqbah ibn Aamir said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: The sun will be brought near to the earth and the people will sweat. For some people, the sweat will come up to their heels; for some it will come halfway up their shins; for some it will come up to their knees; for some it will come up to their backsides; for some it will come up to their hips; for some it will come up to their shoulders; for some it will come up to their necks; for some it will come up to the middle of their mouths; and some of them will be comepletely covered with their sweat. (Narrated by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, no. 16798) There follows the commentary of Ibn Hajar (may Allaah be pleased with him) on the hadeeth (about the shade of Allaah): with His shade. The fact that the shade is connected to Allaah is an expression of honour, for every shade belongs to Him. It was said that this refers to His honour and protection, just as it may be said (in Arabic) that a person is in the shade (or shadow) of the king. And it was said that it refers to the shadow of His Throne, which is more correct the just ruler means one who holds the position of khaleefah, and anyone else who is appointed to a position of authority over the Muslims affairs, and he fulfils his duties justly. The best definition of just is: one who obeys the commands of Allaah and puts everything in its proper place without going to the extreme either of overdoing it or of negligence. The just ruler is mentioned first because his benefits are so far-reaching. a young man. Young men are mentioned in particular because they are more likely to feel desire because of their strong motives for following their desires. The fact that a young man adheres to worship despite that is indicative of the strength of his taqwaa (piety). worshipping his Lord. In the hadeeth of Salmaan it says that he spent his youth and his energy in worshipping Allaah. attached to the mosque. The apparent meaning is attachment in the sense of hanging, as if his heart is likened to something that hangs in the mosque  like a lamp, for example  indicating that his heart is so strongly attached to the mosque that even when he leaves the mosque, his heart is still there. Or it could mean attachment in the sense of a deep love. love one another means, they shared a kind of love whereby each loved the other in a genuine sense, not just to show off. and [they] meet and part on that basis means, this is an ongoing love based on religion, which they do not cut off for any worldly reason, whether they meet in reality or not, until death comes between them. a man who is called by a woman of rank and beauty. The meaning of of rank is, of high birth or a high position; this may refer to lineage or to wealth. The woman is described as having all the qualities which people usually seek, power and wealth, along with beauty. It is very rare to find all three in a woman. The apparent meaning is that she called him to commit immoral actions. and says I fear Allaah. The apparent meaning is that he says this out loud, either to rebuke her for her immoralityor to refuse her call. It may also be that he says it in his heart. to such an extent that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives. What is meant by this is that he conceals his charitable giving , and goes to such an extreme that his left hand, even though it is so close to his right hand and is always with it that even if we imagined that it could understand, it would not know what the right hand is doing because of this utter secrecy. This is a metaphor. and a man who remembers Allaah  either in his heart, or by mentioning Him out loud. when he is alone  because this is furthest away from showing off. What is meant here is that there are no distractions, so he pays attention to nothing except Allaah. his eyes fill up (lit. flood) means, they fill with tears; this is another metaphor. Although men are mentioned in this hadeeth, women are also included in what is described here. Although what is meant by a just leader is the position of imaam (khaleefah), women may also be included in this, if they have children and treat them justly. The idea of being attached to the mosque does not apply to women, because a womans prayer in her home is better than her prayer in the mosque. Apart from that, women have a share in all of these things; if a man may be called by a woman, then it can be imagined that a woman could be called by a handsome king, for example, and she refuses because she fears Allaah, even though she may have motives to respond. Fath al-Baari, 620. There are others whom Allaah will also shade with His shade  apart from the seven mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above  who are mentioned in other ahaadeeth. Ibn Hajar listed them in Fath al-Baari (620) as follows: Those who fight (for the sake of Allaah); those who help the mujaahideen; those who defer payment of debt for debtors who are in difficulty, or let them off all or part of the debt; those who help people who are heavily in debt; those who help slaves who have drawn up contracts of manumission; those who have a good attitude; those who walk to the mosque; sincere and honest traders; those who take what is due to them and no more; those who spend for the sake of Allaah; those who sponsor orphans. We ask Allaah to shade us with His shade on the Day when there will be no shade except His.</answer>

    <title>Wearing coloured contact lenses</title>
    <question>I want to know the islamic view
   on wearing colored contact lenses.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There are two types of contact lenses: Ophthalmic contact lenses: those that are used to correct long- or short-sightedness etc. There is nothing wrong with using this kind of contact lenses on the advice of a specialist eye-doctor. Coloured cosmetic contact lenses: these come under the rulings on adornment. If a woman wears them for her husband, there is nothing wrong with it. If she is wearing them where others will see her too, then it should not cause any fitnah or temptation. There is also the condition that they should not cause any harm, and there should be no element of cheating or deceiving, such as a woman wearing them when she meets the man who is proposing marriage to her. Also, they should not be extravagantly expensive, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  and waste not by extravagance [al-Anaam 6:141]. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>The Man is Head of Household</title>
    <question>IF THE MAN IS NOT THE MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME IS HE CONSIDERED AS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Qiwaamah (the role of being in charge or head of the household) is one of the things that Allaah has given to men, exclusive of women. What is meant by qiwaamah is that men are entrusted with the task of being responsible for women, to take care of them, to guide them in the best possible way, and to issue commands and prohibitions - just as a ruler takes care of the people under his control. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;...but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them [women]...&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:228] and &quot;Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allaah has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means...&quot; [al-Nisaa 4:34] Ibn Katheer said: &quot;This means that men are in charge of women; they govern them and discipline them if they do wrong.&quot; Al-Allaamah Shaykh al-Shanqeeti said: &quot;This indicates that men are better than women, because the masculine is honour and perfection, whereas the feminine naturally has something lacking physically. All people are agreed on this, because all peoples give women the best of adornments, which is only to make up for this natural lack...&quot; Rare cases among women are nothing to go by, because the exception does not change the rule. Some of the reasons why men are given the role of qiwaamah include: 1. Men are more intelligent and have a better ability to distinguish right from wrong. Al-Qurtubi said: &quot;Men have the advantage of being more wise and more capable of management; for this reason they were given the right of qiwaamah.&quot; 2. Mens religion is more complete, because women menstruate and bleed after childbirth, and do not pray or fast at such times - unlike men. 3. Spending money in charity and on ones family is a duty on men, but not on women. Thus if a man refuses to spend on his wife, she has the right to seek an annulment of the marriage by going to a Qaadi (Shareeah judge). In summary, qiwaamah is only for men, as is made clear in the Quraan. If a woman spends on her husband, herself and her children, this is an act of kindness on her part, as Allaah, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;... but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it (the mahr) to you, take it, and enjoy it without fear of any harm (as Allaah has made it lawful).&quot; [al-Nisaa 4:4] Qiwaamah is for men in all cases: one can hardly imagine a man asking his wife for permission to go out, for example. And Allaah knows best. For more information on this matter, please refer to: Ibn al-Arabi, Ahkaam al-Quraan, 1/531; Ahkaam al-Jassaas, 2/188; Tafseer al-Qurtubi, 2/169; Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 1/491; al-Shanqeeti, Adwaa al-Bayaan, 1/136-137)</answer>

    <title>Ruling on Electrically Shocking an Animal When Slaughtering</title>
    <question>What is the ruling of the Ulama with chicken slaughtered by Muslims but were stunned (given mild electric shock to weaken the chicken) before slaughtering?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah., It is prohibited to stun the animals by stroking or using electricity for these kinds of stunning hurt the animal and the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) interdicts us from torturing or hurting animals and on the contrary ordered us to be kind and benevolent with them especially at slaughtering. Imam Ahmad narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas that the Prophet (Peace be upon Him) passed by a group from Al-Ansar (the supporters) while they were aiming at a pigeon. The Prophet said: &quot;Dont make an aim from an alive creature&quot;. Saeed Ibn-Gobair narrated that Ibn-Ommar had passed by some youth from Koraish while they were aiming at a bird and in return for their missed shoots they gave the owner of the bird the arrows. When the youth saw Ibn-Ommar, they ran away so Ibn-Ommar said: &quot;Who did that? Allah curses the one who did that. The prophet (Peace be upon Him) curses any one who takes an alive creature as an aim&quot;.Narrated by Muslim # 3619 Imam Muslim narrated on the authority of Ibn-Gaber Ibn-Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them, that the Prophet &quot;forbids us from leaving animals tied without food or drinks until death&quot; (No. 3620) Also, Imam Muslim narrated that Shadad Ibn-Aws said: &quot;I have kept in heart two points from our Prophet (Peace be upon Him). Allah orders us to refine every thing we do. When killing enemies, kill properly, and when slaughtering animals slaughter properly. So the one in change of slaughtering must sharpen his blade to comfort his slaughtered animal. There are many other evidences that prove the importance of being kind and benevolent with animals. In short, it is unlawful to stun the animal before slaughtering because stunning hurts the animal and Allah forbids us from doing that except in necessary when the animal is out of control at slaughtering and it is difficult to catch it so it is then lawful to resort to partial stunning to control the animal and in turn it would be lawful to be eaten if it is slaughtered alive. This stunning is permitted only if it doesnt lead to death of the animal for if that happened it would be unlawful to be eaten as Allah the Almighty said in His Holy Book: &quot;Forbidden to you (for food) are: dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and that on which hath been invoked the name of other than Allah, that which hath been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a head long fall, or by being gored to death, that which hath been (partly) eaten by a wild animal, unless ye are able to slaughter it (in due from), that which is sacrificed on stone (altars); (forbidden) also is the division (of meat) by raffling with arrow: that is impiety.&quot; (Al-Maidah # 3) And Allah knows best, and Peace &amp; Blessing be upon His Messenger Mohammed and his companions.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on celebrating non-Muslim holidays and congratulating them</title>
    <question>Can a muslim celebrate a non muslim holiday like Thanksgiving?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Greeting the kuffaar on Christmas and other religious holidays of theirs is haraam, by consensus, as Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah: &quot;Congratulating the kuffaar on the rituals that belong only to them is haraam by consensus, as is congratulating them on their festivals and fasts by saying A happy festival to you or May you enjoy your festival, and so on. If the one who says this has been saved from kufr, it is still forbidden. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the cross, or even worse than that. It is as great a sin as congratulating someone for drinking wine, or murdering someone, or having illicit sexual relations, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their religion fall into this error; they do not realize the offensiveness of their actions. Whoever congratulates a person for his disobedience or bidah or kufr exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allaah.&quot; Congratulating the kuffaar on their religious festivals is haraam to the extent described by Ibn al-Qayyim because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of kufr, even if one would not accept those things for oneself. But the Muslim should not aceept the rituals of kufr or congratulate anyone else for them, because Allaah does not accept any of that at all, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;If you disbelieve, then verily, Allaah is not in need of you, He likes not disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for you. . .&quot; [al-Zumar 39:7] &quot;. . . This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion . . .&quot; [al-Maaidah 5:3] So congratulating them is forbidden, whether they are ones colleagues at work or otherwise. If they greet us on the occasion of their festivals, we should not respond, because these are not our festivals, and because they are not festivals which are acceptable to Allaah. These festivals are innovations in their religions, and even those which may have been prescribed formerly have been abrogated by the religion of Islaam, with which Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the whole of mankind. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.&quot; [Aal Imraan 3:85] It is haraam for a Muslim to accept invitations on such occasions, because this is worse than congratulating them as it implies taking part in their celebrations. Similarly, Muslims are forbidden to imitate the kuffaar by having parties on such occasions, or exchanging gifts, or giving out sweets or food, or taking time off work, etc., because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whoever imitates a people is one of them.&quot; Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah said in his book Iqtidaa al-siraat al-mustaqeem mukhaalifat ashaab al-jaheem: &quot;Imitating them in some of their festivals implies that one is pleased with their false beliefs and practices, and gives them the hope that they may have the opportunity to humiliate and mislead the weak.&quot; Whoever does anything of this sort is a sinner, whether he does it out of politeness or to be friendly, or because he is too shy to refuse, or for whatever other reason, because this is hypocrisy in Islaam, and because it makes the kuffaar feel proud of their religion. Allaah is the One Whom we ask to make the Muslims feel proud of their religion, to help them adhere steadfastly to it, and to make them victorious over their enemies, for He is the Strong and Omnipotent.

    <title>When Does the Love of Allah Save a Person From Punishment?</title>
    <question>Will a person who loves Allah enter Hell? There are many non-Muslims such as Jews and Christians who love Allah, and similarly there are immoral Muslims who love Allah. They would never say that they hate their Lord. Can you clarify this matter?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding this matter: There are four kinds of love, which we must differentiate between, and those who go astray do so because they do not make this distinction. The first of them is love of Allah, but this alone is not sufficient to save a person from the punishment of Allah and to earn him His reward. The Mushrikeen (idolaters), worshippers of the cross, Jews and others all love Allah. The second is love of that which Allah loves. This is what brings a person into Islam and out of disbelief. The most beloved of people to Allah is the one who is most correct and most devoted in this kind of love. The third kind is love for the sake of Allah, which is one of the essentials of loving that which Allah loves. A persons love of that which Allah loves cannot be complete until he also loves for the sake of Allah. The fourth is love for something alongside Allah, and this love has to do with shirk (paganism). Everyone who loves things alongside Allah but not for the sake of Allah has taken that thing as a rival to Allah. This is the love of the Mushrikeen (pagan). There remains a fifth kind of love which has nothing to do with our topic; this is the natural love which is a persons inclination towards that which suits his nature, such as the love of a thirsty person for water or of a hungry person for food, or the love of sleep, or of ones wife and children. There is nothing wrong with this unless it distracts a person from remembering Allah and keeps him from loving Him. Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): O you who believe! Let not your properties or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah [63:9] Men whom neither trade nor sale (business) diverts from the remembrance of Allah [24:37] (Al-Jawaab al-Kaafi, 1/134) And he said (may Allah have mercy on him): The difference between loving for the sake of Allah and loving something alongside Allah is one of the most important distinctions. Everyone needs to make this distinction and is indeed obliged to do so. Loving for the sake of Allah is a sign of the perfection of faith, but loving something alongside Allah is the essence of shirk (paganism). The difference between them is that a persons love for the sake of Allah is connected to his love of Allah; if this love becomes strong in his heart, this love dictates that he will love that which Allah loves. If he loves that which his Lord loves and he loves those who are the friends of Allah, this is love for the sake of Allah. So he loves His Messengers, Prophets, angels and close friends because Allah loves them, and he hates those who hate them because Allah hates those people. The sign of the love and hatred for the sake of Allah is that his hatred for the one whom Allah hates will not turn into love merely because that person treats him kindly, does him a service or meets some need he has; and his love for those whom Allah loves will not turn to hatred simply because that person does something that upsets or hurts him, whether it is done by mistake or deliberately, in obedience to Allah or because the person feels that he has a duty to do it for some reason, or because the person is a wrongdoer who may yet give up his wrongdoing and repent. The entire religion revolves around four principles: love and hatred, and stemming from them, action and abstinence. The person whose love and hatred, action and abstinence, are all for the sake of Allah, has perfected his faith so that when he loves, he loves for the sake of Allah, when he hates, he hates for the sake of Allah, when he does something, he does it for the sake of Allah, and when he abstains from something, he abstains for the sake of Allah. To the extent that he is lacking in these four categories, he is lacking in faith and commitment to religion. This is in contrast to the love of things alongside Allah, which is of two types. One is diametrically opposed to the principle of Tawheed (Oneness of Allah) and is shirk; the other is opposed to perfection of sincerity and love towards Allah, but does not put a person beyond the pale of Islam. The first kind is like the love of the Mushrikeen for their idols and gods. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah [2:165] These Mushrikeen love their idols and gods alongside Allah as they love Allah. This love and devotion is accompanied by fear, hope, worship and supplication. This love is pure Shirk which Allah does not forgive. Faith cannot be perfected unless a person regards these idols as enemies and hates them intensely, and hates the people who worship them, and regards them as enemies and strives against them. This is the message with which Allah sent all His Messengers and revealed all His Books. He created Hell for the people of shirk who love these rivals, and He created Paradise for those who strive against them and take them as enemies for His sake and to earn His Pleasure. Anybody who worships anything from the vicinity of the Throne to the lowest depths of the earth and takes a god and a supporter besides Allah and associates other beings in worship with Him, will be disowned by the object of his worship when he is most in need of it [i.e., on the Day of Judgement]. The second kind is love for the things which Allah has made attractive to people, such as women, children, gold, silver, branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. People love them with a kind of desire, like the love of the hungry person for food and the thirsty person for water. This love is of three kinds. If a person loves them for the sake of Allah and as a means of obeying Allah, he will be rewarded for that; it will be counted as a part of love for the sake of Allah and a means of reaching Him, and he will still find enjoyment in them. This is how the best of creation [i.e. the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)] was, to whom women and perfume were made dear in this world, and his love for them helped him to love Allah more and to convey His Message and fulfil His commands. If a person loves them because they suit his nature and his own desires, but he does not give them preference over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, and he gets them because of his natural inclination, then they come under the heading of things which are permissible, and he will not be punished for that, but his love of Allah and for the sake of Allah will be lacking somewhat. If his sole purpose in life is to get these things, and he gives priority to that over that which Allah loves and is pleased with, then he is wronging himself and following his own desires. The first is the love of al-Saabiqoon (those who are foremost in Islam); the second is the love of al-muqtasidoon (those who are average) and the third is the love of al-zaalimoon (the wrongdoers).

    <title>What Is Aqeedah?</title>
    <question>What is Aqeedah? I kindly request you to explain this to me.</question>
    <answer>Contents Related What is Aqeedah? Principles of Aqeedah Praise be to Allah.What is Aqeedah? Aqeedah refers to those matters which are believed in, with certainty and conviction, in ones heart and soul. They are not tainted with any doubt or uncertainty. The Arabic word aqeedah stems from the root aqada, which conveys meanings of certainty, affirmation, confirmation, etc. In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Allah will not punish you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will punish you for your deliberate oaths (bima aqqadtum al-ayman)&quot; [al-Maidah 5:89] The verb paraphrased here as &quot;deliberate oaths&quot; is aqqada/taqeed, which refers to when one has determination in the heart. It may be said in Arabic, aqadal-habl (the rope was tied), i.e., it was pulled tight together. The word itiqad (belief) is also derived from this root, and has the meaning of tying up and making strong. The phrase ataqadtu kadhaa (I believe such and such) means: I am convinced of it in my heart; this is a rational conviction. In Islam, aqeedah is the matter of knowledge. The Muslim must believe in his heart and have faith and conviction, with no doubts or misgivings, because Allah has told him about aqeedah in His Book and via His Revelations to His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Principles of Aqeedah The principles of aqeedah are those which Allah has commanded us to believe in, as mentioned in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books and His Messengers. They say, We make no distinction between one and another of His Messengers  and they say, We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:285] - and as defined by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the famous hadeeth which describes how Jibreel came to him and asked him about Islam etc.: &quot;Iman (faith) is to believe in Allah, His angels, His Books, the meeting with Him on the Last Day, His Messengers, and the Day of Resurrection.&quot; So in Islam, aqeedah refers to the matters which are known from the Quran and sound ahadeeth, and which the Muslim must believe in his heart, in acknowledgement of the truth of Allaah and His Messenger. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on one who slanders Aaishah (may Allah be pleased with her)</title>
    <question>Could you please answer my question about Sheeah (Shia) Islam? Is it permissible for one to think badly of the Prophets wife Aaishah, when anything said about Aaishah is from authentic hadeeeths, such as Saheeh al-Bukhaari and Saheeh Muslim?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Aaishah and the other Mothers of the Believers are included among the Companions of the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), so every text that forbids slandering the Companions refers to Aaishah too. Abu Saeed al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: Do not slander my Companions, for if one of you were to spend an amount of gold equivalent to the size of Mount Uhud, you would not even come halfway up to their level.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 3379). Moreover, the scholars of Sunni Islam are all agreed that whoever condemns Aaishah for that of which Allaah has stated she is innocent is a kaafir, because he has rejected Allaahs statement of her innocence in Soorat al-Noor. Imaam Ibn Hazm quoted a report with an isnad going back to Hishaam ibn Ammaar, who said: &quot;I heard Maalik ibn Anas say: Whoever curses Abu Bakr should be whipped, and whoever curses Aaishah should be killed. He was asked, Why do you say that concerning (the one who curses) Aaishah? He said, Because Allaah says concerning Aaishah, may Allah be pleased with her (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers.&quot; [al-Noor 24:17]&quot; Maalik said: &quot;Whoever accuses her goes against the Quraan, and whoever goes against the Quraan should be killed.&quot; Ibn Hazm said: &quot;This comment of Maaliks is correct, and it is complete apostasy to reject Allaahs words that clearly state her innocence.&quot; Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi said: &quot;Because the people who slandered Aaishah accused a pure and innocent person of immorality, then Allah exonerated her. So everyone who accuses her of that of which Allah has stated she is innocent is rejecting what Allah says, and everyone who rejects what Allah says is a kaafir. This is the opinion of Maalik, and the matter is very clear to those who have insight.&quot; Al-Qaadi Abu Yalaa said: &quot;Whoever slanders Aaishah by accusing her of that of which Allah stated her innocence is a kaafir, without doubt. More than one imam stated this ijmaa (consensus) and gave this ruling.&quot; Ibn Abi Moosaa said: &quot;Whoever accuses Aaishah, may Allah be pleased with her, of that of which Allaah stated she was innocent has left the religion (is no longer a Muslim) and has no right to marry a Muslim woman.&quot; Ibn Qudaamah said: &quot;It is a part of the Sunnah to say May Allah be pleased with her after mentioning the wives of the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), Mothers of the Believers who are pure and innocent of any evil. The best of them are Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid and Aaishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, whose innocence was stated by Allah; (they are) the wives of the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) in this world and the next. Whoever accuses her of that of which Allah has stated her innocence has rejected the words of Allaah All-Mighty.&quot; Imam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &quot;Aaishahs innocence of that of which she was accused is stated definitively in the Quraan. If anyone doubts that (may Allah protect us from such a thing), he becomes a kaafir and an apostate, by the consensus of the Muslims.&quot; Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &quot;The ummah is agreed that whoever slanders her is a kaafir.&quot; Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer said, in his Tafseer: &quot; The scholars, may Allah have mercy on them, all agreed that whoever accuses or slanders her after the revelation of this aayah is a kaafir, because he has rejected the Quraan.&quot; Badr al-Deen al-Zirkashi said: &quot;Whoever slanders her is a kaafir, because the Quraan clearly states her innocence.&quot; The scholars based their ruling on the one who slanders Aaishah on the following evidence: (1) The evidence that is derived from the verses in Soorat al-Noor that clearly state her innocence. So whoever accuses her after Allah has declared her innocent is rejecting the words of Allah, which is kufr beyond any shadow of a doubt. (2) Slandering the family of the Prophet SAWS (peace be upon him) hurts and offends the Prophet himself, and there is no doubt that whatever hurts and offends the Prophet SAWS (peace be upon him) is kufr, by consensus (ijmaa). Evidence that the slander of his wife hurt and offended the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) is seen in the hadeeth of the slander (al-ifk) reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, in which Aaishah says: &quot;. . . The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) stood up on that day and asked who would go and deal with Abdullaah ibn Ubayy. He was on the minbar, and said: O Muslims, who will deal with a man who I have heard is speaking in an offensive manner about my family? By Allaah, I know nothing but good about my family. . . .&quot; What the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) meant was: who will be kind to me, and excuse me if I go and deal with him myself, and I give him what he deserves because I have heard that he is speaking in an offensive manner about my family. This proves that the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was so deeply offended and hurt that he asked people whether they could deal with this person fairly. Imaam al-Qurtubi said, in his Tafseer of the aayah &quot;Allaah forbids you from it [slander] and warns you not to repeat the like of it forever, if you are believers.&quot; [al-Noor 24:17]&quot;: &quot;This is concerning Aaishah . . . because of the hurt and offence that the Messenger of Allah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) felt with regard to his honour and his family. This is kufr on the part of the one who does it.&quot; (3) Slandering Aaishah implies insulting the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), because Allah, may He be glorified, says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Bad statements are for bad people (or bad women for bad men) and bad people for bad statements (or bad men for bad women). . . &quot; [al-Noor 24:26] Al-Haafiz ibn Katheer, may Allah have mercy on him, said: &quot;I.e., Allah would not have made Aaishah the wife of the Messenger of Allah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) if she had not been good, because he is better than any good person. If she had been bad, she would not have been fit to marry him from a shari point of view, and Allah would never even have decreed it..&quot; Finally, let us remember that the most beloved of all people to him (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was Aaishah al-Siddeeqah bint al-Siddeeq, as is proven in the report of Amr ibn al-Aas, who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) put me in charge of an army during the ghazwah (campaign) of al-Salaasil. I came to him and asked him, O Messenger of Allaah, who among the people is most beloved to you? He said, Aaishah. I asked, Who among men? He said, Her father. I asked, Then who? He said, Umar, then he mentioned a number of others.&quot; So whoever feels hatred towards the beloved of the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) will deserved to be despised by him on the Day of Resurrection. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Donating Blood to Non-Muslims</title>
    <question>What is the Islamic ruling on blood donation? Specifically, I am referring to donating blood in America and knowing it will probably go to non-Muslims.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. It is permissible for a Muslim to donate blood to a non-Muslim, except when that non-Muslim is known to be in a position of fighting the Muslims (either by belonging to a state which is in a state of war with Muslims or by supporting aggression towards them). In such a case it is not permissible to donate blood, because this will help them to fight Muslims. If the Muslim has no way of knowing to whom his blood will go, he should act according to what he thinks is most likely to happen. If he thinks that it is most likely to go to a kaafir who is not fighting the Muslims, it is permitted to donate, otherwise it is not.</answer>

    <title>The sick performing Hajj</title>
    <question>I am a Japanese guy (not Muslim). My Japanese
   friend became a Muslim a few months ago. He wants to go to Mecca (Makkah) to make a
   pilgrimage in the near future, but he has a big injury on his foot, and needs to use a
   crutch.
  Can he go to Makkah? Or can people who are not
   healthy not make the pilgrimage?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Allaah says in His Holy Book: . . . Hajj to the House [Kabah] is a duty that mankind owes to Allaah, those who can afford the expenses (for ones conveyance, provision and residence]; and whoever disbelieves, then Allaah stands not in need of any of the Aalameen [mankind and jinn]. [Aal Imraan 3:97] The scholars discussion of the ability to perform Hajj revolves around the availability of a means of transport and sufficient money for the journey there and back, as well as sufficient funds to cover ones familys needs during ones absence, freedom from debt, good health, security on the way, and - for women - a mahram (blood relative within the prohibited degrees of marriage, or a husband). The issue of your Muslim friend revolves around the question of health, so we will focus on this matter here: With regard to the interpretation of the aayah (verse of the Quraan) quoted above, Ikrimah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Sabeel [paraphrased in the phrase those who can afford the expenses] means health. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). One of the conditions of Hajj being obligatory is that a person should be free of physical illness and disability that would prevent him from performing Hajj. If a person is suffering from a chronic illness, permanent disability, paralysis (that makes him unable to walk) or is very old and unable to move about, then there is no obligation to perform Hajj. If a person is able to perform Hajj with the help of another, then it becomes a duty to perform Hajj when such help is available. (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 17/34). Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: There may be different categories of ability. Sometimes a person may be able to perform Hajj by himself, and sometimes with the help of others, as is stated in the books of Ahkaam (Islamic rulings). (Tafseer of the aayah previously quoted). Whoever suffers from a permanent disability that prevents him from performing Hajj must appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. If his disability is not permanent, then he should wait until he has recovered, then perform Hajj for himself; he is not permitted to appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf. This is the answer to your question, which I hope you will convey to your friend. I do not want to miss this opportunity to thank you for your concern and interest in finding out the Islamic rulings in this situation which has to do with the fifth pillar of Islam. I also wish to encourage and invite you to join us in Islam. Peace be with you.</answer>

    <title>It is incorrect to pray Dhuhr after Jumu&amp;#146;ah prayer</title>
    <question>I heard from some imams that under the following situations we have to pray another 4 rakat Fard zuhur prayer (noon prayer) after the 2 rakat Juma (Friday) prayer, is it true? if we are far from Saudi Arabia or if we are not staying in an Islamic Country or if we don't have any Islamic leader as our government in the country 
Kindly answer my question, since I found that many old people they follow these in our country, however, I didn't find any Hadith relating to these things. May Allah (s.w.t) bless you. Thank you.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Praying four rakahs after Jumuah prayer is the opinion of some Madhhabs, and has nothing to do with staying in Makkah or far away, or being in an Islaamic country or not, or whether or not there is a khaleefah. The existence or permission of a khaleefah is not a condition for Friday prayers being obligatory or valid, according to Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 8/187) Having dealt with what you have heard from people who have no knowledge, but who are unfortunately in the position of &quot;imaams,&quot; as you said, we move on to the basic issue of offering salaat al-dhuhr after salaat al-jumuah. Our answer to this question is that the truth is the opinion of the scholars, most of whom say that there is no basis in shareeah for offering dhuhr prayer after jumuah prayer if a person has prayed jumuah. The one who misses jumuah or does not attend it because it is not an obligation for him or her, such as women, sick people or travellers, must pray dhuhr. It was never reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or any of his Companions prayed dhuhr after praying jumuah. If he had done so, there would be reports to that effect. We ask Allaah to give you and us help and strength. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad .</answer>

    <title>Causes that make ghusl a must</title>
    <question>What are all the conditions when ghusl is compulsory?
Is the only time you have to do it is after seminal discharge.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The causes that make ghusl a must are: 1. The emission of semen, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;What requires water (ghusl) is if you see water (i.e., semen) coming out of you.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 1/269) 2. Contact between the genitals, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;If one part enters the other part (in another report: if one part touches the other part), then ghusl becomes obligatory.&quot; (Reported by Ahmad and Muslim, no. 526) This ghusl is obligatory whether or not fluid (semen) is released. &quot;touching&quot; here refers to the entry of the tip of the penis into the vagina, not mere touching. 3. Menstruation and nifaas (post-natal bleeding), because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;. . . And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allaah has ordained for you. . .&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:222]; and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Hubaysh, may Allaah be pleased with her: &quot;When your period starts, stop praying, and when your period ends, perform ghusl then start praying again.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 309) 4. Death: the dead - apart from a martyr slain in battle - must be washed (ghusl), because when his daughter Zaynab died, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Wash her with water three or five times, or as many times as you see fit&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, 1175); and when a man who was in a state of ihraam was killed by his riding-beast, he said: &quot;Wash him with water and lotus leaves and wrap him in his two garments, but do not embalm him or cover his head, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing the Talbiyah.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, 1186) There are other types of ghusl about which the scholars differed as to whether they are obligatory, such as performing ghusl on Fridays, or whether a person who becomes Muslim needs to perform ghusl upon entering the Faith. There are types of ghusl which are encouraged, such as: ghusl on the two Eids; ghusl after washing a dead body; ghusl before entering the state of ihraam or entering Makkah; ghusl for a woman who is suffering from istihaadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding) before every prayer; ghusl after being unconscious; and ghusl after burying a mushrik. (Tamaam al-Minnah by al-Albaani, p. 120). And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Najaasah (impurity) of dogs and the ruling on keeping a dog</title>
    <question>I am confused as to the position of the dog in Islam. I thought that what is najis is the nose (saliva) and that no other part of the dog is najis, except when it is wet. I also understood that keeping a dog as guard dog etc...is not haram. however, in Malaysia, there is a very strong aversion to the dog amongst Muslim communities to the extent that even in educational religious books produced from this country condemns the dog as najis (throughout) and haram to keep.
I hope you can clarify this.</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah. The fuqahaa are agreed that it is not permitted to keep a dog unless it is for a purpose, like hunting or guarding property or other uses that are not contrary to the Shareeah. The Prophet (peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for herding, hunting or farming, his reward will decrease by one qiraat every day.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, 2948) As far as keeping a dog to guard the house is concerned, Ibn Qudaamah said: &quot;It is not permitted, according to the most sound opinion.&quot; (al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah, 35/124) For more information on this matter, please see question #377 . As regards the najaasah (impurity) of the dog, the Shaafii and Hanbali ulamaa say that the whole dog is essentially naajis (impure). Some scholars say that any liquid excreted by the dog is naajis (not the dog itself). The saliva of the dog is extremely naajis, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;If a dog licks the vessel of any one of you, let him throw away whatever was in it and wash it seven times.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 418). Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;The way to purify the vessel of any one of you if a dog has licked it is to wash it seven times, the first time with earth.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 420). We must ensure that Muslims continue to be averse to dogs, even in the midst of what the kuffaar are used to do and what some Muslims have adopted of their habits. May Allaah bestow good on you and on us. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Tahaarah (purity) for one suffering from incontinence</title>
    <question>I have an allergy which causes me to sneeze very violently very frequently. Since I became pregnant, I suffer from incontinence whenever I sneeze. As I go to work I cannot change my clothes everytime I need to pray. Can I do wudhu and still pray when I know my clothes have najis on them. Do I need to repeat my prayers on returning home?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; and [Allaah] has not laid upon you in religion any hardship&quot; [al-Hajj 22:78] and &quot; Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:185]. It is sufficient, my sister, if you perform wudoo' before every prayer after the time for it has begun, and do not worry about anything that comes out after that. You could also put a piece of cloth or something similar so that the najaasah (impure substance - in this case urine) does not spread, then throw it away and wash yourself before making wudoo'. We ask Allaah to heal you and give good health to you and to every sick Muslim.</answer>

    <title>Kinds of Tawassul</title>
    <question>I have been discussing the subject of using &quot;waseela&quot; while supplicating to Allah (swt) with some Muslims, and have come to know that there are quite different opinions about fact whether the use of &quot;waseela&quot; in duaa is halaal or haraam. Could you please provide me with some information about this subject, some ayaat from the Holy Qur'an or authentic ahaadeeth? With the term &quot;use of waseela&quot; I mean asking via the agency of someone, fx &quot;I ask You (O Allah) to grant me forgiveness via the agency of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him and his household)&quot; or via the agency of other Prophets (Peace be upon them), saints or other pious Muslims.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.What is meant by tawassul and waseelah is four things: the kind of tawassul without which faith cannot be complete, which is seeking to reach Allaah (tawassul) by believing in Him and His Messengers, and obeying Him and His Messenger, This is what is meant in the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Do your duty to Allaah and fear Him. Seek the means of approach to Him [al-Maaidah 5:35] This includes seeking to approach Allaah through His Names and Attributes, or by doing acts of obedience and worship by which one seeks to approach Allaah, and so on. Seeking to approach Allaah by asking His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to make dua for one during his lifetime, and the believers asking one another to make duaa for one another. This follows on from the first type and is encouraged. Seeking to approach Allaah by virtue of the status and virtues of some created being, such as saying, O Allaah, I ask You by virtue of Your Prophet and so on. This is allowed by some of the ulama, but this opinion is daeef (weak). The correct view is that it is definitely haraam, because there can be no tawassul in duaa except by virtue of the Names and Attributes of Allaah. Tawassul as it is understood by many of the Muslims of later times, which is calling on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and seeking his help (or seeking the help of the dead and so-called awliya). This is a form of major shirk, because calling on or seeking help from anyone other than Allaah with regard to something that that only Allaah is able to do is a kind of worship, and directing worship to anyone or anything other than Allaah is major shirk. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Can Women Go to the Mosque?</title>
    <question>Here in my country (Surinam, South America), the Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah forbid women to go to the mosque, saying that the first Imam (Imam Abu Hanifah) learned to do what pleases the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), and he had said once that it is better for the women to perform prayer at home, because there is more reward in that, and as we come here to earn reward, it is better to do this.
Is it right to forbid women to go to the mosque? If so, where in the Holy Quran or the hadith can I find this?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Is a woman's prayer at home better than praying in the mosque? Can women go to mosques? Conditions for the permission for women to go to mosques Praise be to Allah.Is a woman's prayer at home better than praying in the mosque? There is no doubt that a womans prayer in her house is better for her than praying in the mosque, as is indicated by the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: &quot;Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque, even though their houses are better for them.&quot; (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ilal-masjid: Bab al-tashdid fi dhalik. See also Sahih al-Jami, no. 7458) Whenever a woman prays in a place that is more private and more hidden, that is better for her, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;A womans prayer in her house is better than her prayer in her courtyard, and her prayer in her bedroom is better than her prayer in her house.&quot; (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Bab ma ja-a fi khuruj al-nisa ilal-masjid. See also Sahh al-Jami, no. 3833). Umm Humayd, the wife of Abu Humayd al-Saidi reported that she came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah, I love to pray with you.&quot; He said: &quot;I know that you love to pray with me, but praying in your house is better for you than praying in your courtyard, and praying in your courtyard is better for you than praying in the mosque of your people, and praying in the mosque of your people is better for you than praying in my mosque.&quot; So she ordered that a prayer-place be built for her in the furthest and darkest part of her house, and she always prayed there until she met Allah (i.e., until she died). (Reported by Imam Ahmad; the men of its isnad are trustworthy) Can women go to mosques? But the fact that praying at home is preferable does not mean that that women are not permitted to go to the mosque, as is clear from the following hadith: From Abdullah ibn Umar, who said: &quot;I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) say: Do not prevent your women from going to the mosque if they ask your permission.&quot; Bilal ibn Abdullah said, &quot;By Allah, we will prevent them.&quot; (Ibn Umar) turned to him and told him off in an unprecedented fashion, saying: &quot;I tell you what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him) said, and you say By Allah, we will prevent them!!&quot; (Reported by Muslim, 667) Conditions for the permission for women to go to mosques But there are conditions attached to the permission for women to go to the mosque , as follows: She should wear complete hijab . She should not go out wearing perfume . She should have the permission of her husband. Her going out should not involve any other kind of prohibited acts, such as being alone in a car with a non-mahram driver. If a woman does something wrong like that, her husband or guardian has the right to stop her; in fact it is his duty to do so. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Translating the Friday Khutbah</title>
    <question>Is it permissible to hold the Jummah Khutbah in English if the majority of the community does not understand Arabic? Have the scholars agreed on this issue or is there a difference of opinions?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Some of the scholars said that it is not permitted to translate the khutbah given from the minbar on Friday and the two Eids into foreign (non-Arabic) languages. Their intention (may Allaah have mercy on them) was to maintain and preserve the Arabic language, and to follow the way of the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions (may Allaah be pleased with them), which was to give the khutbah in Arabic in the lands of the Persians and others, and to encourage the people to learn Arabic and pay attention to it. Other scholars said that it is permissible to translate khutbahs into other languages if most of the people being addressed do not know Arabic, based on the reason for which Allaah enjoined the khutbah, which is to teach the people about the rulings that Allaah has prescribed for them and to tell them of the sins which are forbidden, to guide them towards good characteristics and to warn them against bad characteristics. Undoubtedly paying attention to the aims and purposes is more important and takes precedence over paying attention to the words used, especially when the audience does not understand Arabic and the khutbah does not have any effect on them and does not motivate them to learn Arabic. (Especially in these times when the Muslims have fallen behind and others have advanced, and the language of the dominant people has become widespread and the language of the defeated is in a weaker position). If the aim of conveying knowledge and Islamic teaching to the people can only be achieved among non-Arabs by translating the khutbahs into their languages, then the view that it is permissible to translate the khutbah into the prevalent language of the audience so that they may understand what is being said takes precedence and should be followed, especially if not translating the khutbahs will lead to conflicts and arguments. Undoubtedly translating the khutbah in such a case becomes essential to serve the peoples interests and avoid mischief. If there are some people in the congregation who do understand Arabic, then the khateeb should combine the two languages, giving the khutbah in Arabic then repeating it in the other language which the other people understand. In this manner he will achieve the two purposes, avoiding mischief and conflict among the people whom he is addressing. There is a great deal of evidence to support that in the pure shareeah, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): And We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) clear for them. [Ibraaheem 14:4] And the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) commanded Zayd ibn Thaabit to learn the language of the Jews so that he might send letters to them in their language and establish proof against them, and so that he might read their letters when they were sent, and explain to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) what they said. And when the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) attacked the Romans and Persians, they did not fight them until they had called them to Islam by means of interpreters. When they conquered the foreign countries they called the people to Allaah in Arabic and commanded the people to learn it. Whoever among them did not know Arabic, they called him in his own language and made him understand what was meant in the language that he did understand. Thus proof was established. Undoubtedly this is the only way, especially at the end of time when Islam is like a stranger and every people is clinging to its own language. There is a very real need for translation now, and the daaiyah cannot convey his message without it. The khateeb should do that which best suits the interests of the people he is addressing. If the best is to give the khutbah part by part, in Arabic and then translated, then he should do that. If the best is to translate the entire khutbah, after giving the khutbah (in Arabic) or after the prayer, then he should do that. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>He loves a woman but his mother disrespects her because of her origins</title>
    <question>Assalama alaikum, ya shaykhuna, I have a
   question which is about my mother. I have a girlfried who is muslim and my mother and same
   of my family don't want me to get married to her because of her (tribe). They think that
   her tribe is no good and no one gets married to them. My girlfried and i came from the
   same country, culture, and relegion but different tribes. What did the quaran say about
   people who disrespect others for who they are. She said that if I get married to her she
   will disowned me and will never talk to her. I am so confused because the quran says do
   what your mother tells you to do. I think what my mother is doing is aneceptable in the
   quran which I'm not sure. I never talk back to my mother and i respect her opinions but
   what can i do and how can I handle situation like this what can I do please helb me.
   thank you</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.Before we find out what the Quraan says about despising others because of their origins, we should know what the Quraan says about having girlfriends. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Wed them with the permission of their own folk and give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends [al-Nisaa 4:25] In his commentary on this aayah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Muhsanaat [translated as chaste] means that they should be pure, not indulging in zinaa (unlawful sexual conduct), hence they are described as not being musaafihaat, which means promiscuous women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them Ibn Abbaas said: muttakhidhaati akhdaan means lovers. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: It means a (male) friend. Allaah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that situation Now that you know the Islamic ruling on this matter and are sure that what you have done is haraam and sinful, we will now move on to what Allaah says about despising others for their origins. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Let not a group scoff at another group, it may be that the latter are better than the former; nor let (some) women scoff at other women, it may be that the latter are better than the former [al-Hujuraat 49:11] Allaah has not created mankind in nations and tribes so that they may be proud and despise one another, but so that they may be distinguished from one another and thus get to know one another. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you with Allaah is that (believer) who has taqwa (i.e. is one of the muttaqeen the pious). Verily Allaah is All-Knowing, All-Aware. [al-Hujuraat 49:13] Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his commentary on this aayah: Here Allaah is telling mankind that He created them from one soul, from which He created its mate this refers to Aadam and Hawwa (Adam and Eve) and made them into nations, which are bigger than tribes. Beyond the tribe there are other smaller units and divisions, such as families and clans. An alternative interpretation is that nations refers to the non-Arabs and tribes refers to the Arabs. All people are equal with regard to lineage because of their descent from Aadam and Hawwa, upon whom be peace, but some may be better than others in religious matters, i.e., in obedience to Allaah and in following His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). For this reason, after forbidding envy and scornful attitudes towards others, Allaah pointed out their equality as human beings: O mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another i.e., that they may know one another by referring to their tribes. Mujaahid said that this meant by calling a person So-and-so the son of So-and-so, from such-and-such a tribe. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked, Which people are the most honourable? He said: The most honourable in the sight of Allaah are the most pious (those who have most taqwa). They said, That is not what we were asking about. He said: The most honourable of people is Yoosuf the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Prophet of Allaah, the son of the Friend (khaleel) of Allaah. They said: That is not what we were asking about. He said, Are you asking about which lineage of the Arabs is most honourable? They said, Yes. He said: The best of you at the time of Jaahiliyyah are the best of you in Islam, if they understand properly. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) also reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah does not look at your outward appearance or your wealth, He looks at your hearts and your deeds. Further information that is relevant to your question may be found under #1805 and #1114. We ask Allaah to bless us and you with strength and goodness, and to keep us all away from that which is forbidden. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Evidence that Allah is Exalted, High Above His Creation and Above the Heavens</title>
    <question>Some people say that Allah is above the heavens (according to one of the verses of the Quran), and may scholars say that Allah exists without a place, since only the creation has the characteristic of needing a place and we know the ayah &quot;Laysa-ka-mithli-he-shay&quot; - (proving Allah does not resemble His creation); is He everywhere, existing without a place, or above the heavens?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah., The people of Sunnah and Jamaah (adherents to the prophetic way) believe that Allah is exalted above His creation because of the evidence of the Quran, Sunnah (prophetic traditions), consensus of the scholars, common sense and mans innate instinct (fitrah). (1) The Quran describes the &quot;exaltedness&quot; or &quot;highness&quot; of Allah in different ways, as His being high and above, and by describing how things come down from Him, and go up to Him, and by stating that He is above heaven. For example (interpretations of the meaning): (Highness): &quot; and He is the Most High, the Most Great.&quot; [2:255] &quot;Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High.&quot; [87:1] (Above): &quot;And He is the Irresistible, above His slaves &quot; [6:18] &quot;They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.&quot; [16:50] (Things coming down from Him): &quot;He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the earth  &quot; [32:5] &quot;Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quran) &quot; [15:9] (Things going up to Him): &quot; To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it &quot; [35:10] &quot;The angels and the Rooh (Jibreel) ascend to Him &quot; [70:4] (Allah is above heaven): &quot;Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven, will not cause the earth to sink with you ?&quot; [67:16] (2) The Sunnah: Many reports were narrated &quot;mutawatir&quot; (i.e. with a large number of narrators at every stage of the isnad/chain, such that it is impossible for them all to have agreed on a lie) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), describing his words and deeds and things of which he approved. For example, he used to say &quot;Subhana Rabbi al-Ala (Glory be to my Lord Most High)&quot; in sujood (prostration), and in some ahadeeth (reports) he is reported to have said &quot;By Allah Who is above the Throne.&quot; Among his deeds is the gesture of pointing up with his finger, when addressing the people in the greatest gathering, on the Day of Arafah during his Farewell Pilgrimage. He asked the people, &quot;Have I not conveyed the message?&quot; and they said, &quot;Yes!&quot; He asked again, &quot;Have I not conveyed the message?&quot; and they said, &quot;Yes!&quot; He asked a third time, Have I not conveyed the message?&quot; and they said &quot;Yes!&quot; Each time, he said: &quot;O Allah, bear witness!&quot; - pointing up to the sky and then at the people. He also used to raise his hands towards heaven when he made dua (supplication), as reported in many ahadeeth. This is proof via his actions that Allah is exalted and high. An example of an approval of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) which indicates that Allah is exalted and high is the hadeeth (report) concerning the young slave girl, to whom the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;Where is Allah?&quot; She said: &quot;In heaven.&quot; He asked, &quot;Who am I?&quot; She said, &quot;The Messenger of Allah.&quot; So he said to her master: &quot;Set her free, for she is a believer.&quot; This young girl was uneducated, as many are, and she was a slave, but she knew that her Lord is above heaven. Some misguided people deny that Allah is above heaven, and say, &quot;He is neither above nor below; neither to the right nor to the left. He is everywhere!&quot; (3) The consensus of the scholars: The salaf (pious predecessors) agreed that Allah is above heaven, as is reported by scholars such as al-Dhahabi, may Allah have mercy on him, in his book Al-Aluw lil-Aliy al-Ghaffar. (4) Common sense: Highness is a quality which is associated in peoples minds with perfection. If this is the case, then it should be attributed to Allah because every absolute perfection should be attributed to Him. (5) The innate instinct of man (fitrah). There should be no dispute that man instinctively knows that Allah is above heaven. Whenever something overwhelming befalls a person, and he turns to Allah for help, he looks towards heaven, not in any other direction. But it is strange that those who deny that Allah is above His creation still raise their hands in supplication to no other direction than towards heaven. Even Pharaoh, the enemy of Allah who disputed with Moosa (peace be upon him) about his Lord, told his minister Haman (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;O Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, - the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the god of Moosa &quot; [40:36-37] He knew in his heart of hearts that Allah is real, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And they belied them (those ayat/signs) wrongfully and arrogantly, though their own selves were convinced thereof &quot; [27:14] These are a few of the indications that Allah is above the heavens; this proof comes from the Quran, the Sunnah, the consensus of the scholars, common sense, mans own instincts and even the words of the non-Muslims. We ask Allah to guide us towards the Truth. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Wudoo is a prerequisite for wiping on socks</title>
    <question>Is it permissible to do masah(wiping) on the socks even if one did not have wudu prior to putting on his socks. Example: It is hard to wash ones feet at their business, because people think we are making a mess.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.First: A Muslim must be proud of his religion and not feel ashamed of its rites and rituals being performed in front of others, or of what shariah imposes upon him. If he fears that seeing the implementation of a religious practice or ruling may cause the unbelievers to have an aversion to the religion, then he wisely conceals, aiming at presenting Islam gradually and in an appropriate way. This doesnt mean to be ashamed or weak or feeling disgrace from implementation of some religious rituals. I suspect you fear from their disapproval because of their misunderstanding, inverted senses, and spoiled opinions, ideas, and inclinations. How could the removal of ones socks and the washing of ones feet be considered filthy or disgusting, when the fact that is that it effects cleanliness and the removal of sweat and unpleasant odor from the feet? Second: It is not permissible for the person to pass wet hands over the socks unless he put them on in a state of purity. You can find the evidence in the following Hadith narrated by Al-Mughirah Ibn-Shubah, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said: &quot;I was traveling with our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Prophet asked me saying, &quot;Have you got any water?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes&quot;  and poured out water so that the Prophet washed his face and hands... and his arms then wiped his head. Then I bent over to pull off his khuff (a type of thick sock) but the Prophet said &quot;Leave them for I put on my khuff in a state of purification&quot; then he wiped over them. (narrated by Al-Bukhari, Fath ul-Baari No. # 5353) Ibn Hajar, may Allaah bless him, quoted the following in his explanation of the portion of this Hadith in which the Prophets said &quot;I put them on a state of purification&quot;: Al-Hamidy related in his Musnad that the Prophet was asked whether one could pass wet hands over the khuff, the Prophet answered saying: &quot;Yes if the person puts them on in a state of purification.&quot; Ibn Khuzayma said that according to Hadith narrated by Safwan Ibn Assal, &quot;the Prophet ordered us to wipe over khuff if we put them on in a state of purification, for 3 days during traveling and for one day and night in residency&quot;. Safwans hadith, although it is sahih, does not meet the conditions defined by Al-Bukhari. But al-Mughirahs hadith is in agreement with it in its indication of the stipulation of being in a pure state before putting on the socks. Third: It is in fact easy to solve your problem; all you need to do is perform the complete ablution at home before going to work, washing your feet, then put on your socks. Then, if you want to perform ablution again at work, you can pass your wet fingertips over the back (i.e., top) of each foot. And Allah Knows Best</answer>

    <question>This is my first question to you and it is read as follows:

Who was the first person to name our holy book (Qur'an) to be named QUR'AN?

I read from a magazine that it was ABUBEKER (R.A.) . But I couldn't believe! In sura al INSAN verse 23 it says, &quot;We brought (down) to you the Qur'an&quot; .

Dear brother please give me a clear picture about this.

May Allah help you.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.You have answered your own question, as it were, because it is Allaah who gave His Book this name, &quot;Quraan.&quot; Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quraan . . .&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:185] &quot;Do they not then consider the Quraan carefully . . .?&quot; [al-Nisaa 4:82] &quot;So, when the Quraan is recited, listen to it, and be silent that you may receive mercy . . .&quot; [al-A raaf 7:204] &quot;Verily, Allaah has purchased of the believers their lives and their properties; for the price that their shall be Paradise. They fight in Allaahs Cause, so they kill (others) and are killed. It is a promise in truth which is binding on Him in the Tawraat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and the Quraan . . .&quot; [al-Tawbah 9:111] &quot;And this Quraan is not such as could ever be produced by other than Alaah, but it is a confirmation of (the revelation) which was before it, and a full explanation of the Book wherein there is no doubt from the Lord of the Aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)&quot; [Yunus 10:37] &quot;Verily, We have sent it down as an Arabic Quraan in order that you might understand&quot; [Yusuf 12:2] &quot;We relate unto you [Muhammad] the best of stories through Our Revelations unto you, of this Quraan. And before this, you were among those who knew nothing about it (the Quraan).&quot; [Yusuf 12:3] &quot;And indeed, We have bestowed upon you seven of al-Mathaani (the seven repeatedly recited verses, i.e. Soorat al-Faatihah) and the Grand Quraan.&quot; [al-Hijr 15:87] &quot;So when you want to recite the Quraan, seek refuge with Allaah from Shaytaan, the outcast (the cursed one).&quot; [al-Nahl 16:98] &quot;Verily, this Quraan guides to that which is most just . . .&quot; [al-Israa 17:9] &quot;And We send down from the Quraan that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe, and it increases the zaalimoon (wrongdoers) nothing but loss.&quot; [al-Israa 17:82] &quot;Say: If mankind and the jinns were together to produce the like of this Quraan, they could not produce the like thereof, even if they helped one another.&quot; [al-Israa 17:88] &quot;And (it is) a Quraan which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages.&quot; [al-Israa 17:106] &quot;We have not sent down the Quraan unto you [O Muhammad] to cause you distress&quot; [Ta-Ha 20:2] &quot;Then High above all be Allaah, the True King. And be not in haste (O Muhammad) with the Quraan before its revelation is completed to you, and say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.&quot; [Ta-Ha 20:114] &quot;Ta-Seen [These letters are one of the miracles of the Quraan, and none but Allaah (Alone) knows their meanings]. These are the Verses of the Quraan, and (it is) a Book (that makes things) clear&quot; [al-Naml 27:1] &quot;And verily, you (O Muhammad) are receiving the Quraan from the One, All-Wise, All-Knowing.&quot; [al-Naml 27:6] &quot;Verily, He Who has given you (O Muhammad) the Quraan will surely bring you back to the Maaad (place of return, either to Makkah or to Pradise after your death) . . .&quot; [al-Qasas 28:85] &quot;By the Quraan, full of wisdom&quot; [Yaa-Seen 36:2] &quot;And indeed, We have made the Quraan easy to understand and remember, then is there any that will remember (or receive admonition)?&quot; [al-Qamar 54:40] &quot;That (this) is indeed an honourable recital (the Noble Quraan).&quot; [al-Waaqiah 56:77] &quot;Had We sent down this Quraan on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder by the fear of Allah . . .&quot; [al-Hashr 59:21] &quot;or a little more; and recite the Quraan (aloud) in a slow, (pleasant tone and) style.&quot; [al-Muzzammil 73:4] &quot;Nay! This is a Glorious Quraan&quot; [al-Burooj 85:21] Can there be any doubt after reading all these aayaat that it is Allaah - and not Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) or anyone else - Who has given the name &quot;Quraan&quot; to the Book which He revealed to Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)? In Arabic, the word &quot;Quran&quot; comes from the word meaning al-qar, which means &quot;gathering&quot; and &quot;putting things together.&quot; It is so called because it is a collection of all the siwar (plural of surah). It was also suggested that it is so called because it combines the fruits of the previously-revealed books, or because it combines all kinds of knowledge. (See al-Itqaan by al-Suyooti, 1/162-163). Finally, we advise you to check what you read so that you do not get confused by unreliable sources in books and magazines that may cause you to doubt the truth. May Allaah bless you and us with beneficial knowledge and help us to perform righteous deeds.</answer>

    <title>Is Plastic Surgery Haram?</title>
    <question>If a woman's body has been altered so much during her pregnancies that she feels ashamed to show herself in front of her husband, is she allowed to have plastic surgery?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Ruling on performing plastic surgery Types of faults that necessitate plastic surgery Plastic surgery: Difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden Haram cosmetic surgical procedures Praise be to Allah.Ruling on performing plastic surgery Your question revolves around the ruling on performing plastic surgery, on which we will give you a brief summary. Doctors who specialize in plastic or cosmetic surgery define it as surgery performed to improve the appearance of part of the body. This may be done by choice, or because it is necessary. Plastic surgery that is considered necessary is that which is done when there is a need for it, when something does not look right, when something is missing, if there is too much or too little of something, or because something has been destroyed or deformed . At the same time, it is regarded as cosmetic surgery because it results in improved appearance. Types of faults that necessitate plastic surgery Faults may be of two types: physical or congenital faults and faults which result from illness. Congenital faults include abnormally turned-out lips , hare-lips, twisted fingers or toes, etc. Faults which result from illness include the scars left by leprosy or other skin diseases, or scars caused by accidents and burns. There is no doubt that such faults and scars cause physical and psychological pain and harm, therefore Islam allows people afflicted with them to remove or reduce them by surgical means. They cause the kind of mental and psychological pain that allows this surgery as an urgent need, where necessity permits something that is ordinarily forbidden. Any cosmetic surgery which comes under this heading of need because of the fact that the reason for the surgery is causing harm is permissible, and is not considered to be changing the creation of Allah. Plastic surgery: Difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden To further understand the difference between what is permitted and what is forbidden, we will quote the words of al-Imam al-Nawawi in his commentary on the hadith: Allah has cursed the women who make tattoos and the women who have this done, the women who pluck facial(eyebrow) hair and the women who have this done, and women who widen the gap between their own or others teeth for the sake of beauty, changing what Allah has created. (Sahih Muslim, 3966) Al-Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The woman who tattoos is one who uses a needle or similar implements to prick the skin of the hand, wrist, lips or other part of a woman's body until she draws blood, then she puts dye into the wound. It is haram to do this or have it done by choice. Similarly, plucking or removing hair from the face is also haram, whether one does it or asks someone else to do it for one, unless a woman has a beard or moustache, in which case it is not haram to remove it. Widening the gap between the teeth is done by filing between the incisors. This is done by old women to give the appearance of youth and make the teeth look beautiful, because this attractive gap between the teeth is characteristic of young girls. When a woman gets old, her teeth get big and look ugly, so she may file them to make them look more attractive and give the impression that she is younger. It is haram to do this or have it done by another, because of this hadith, and because it involves changing what Allah has created, and is a form of deception and falsehood. Widening the gap between the teeth is something that is done to make a person look beautiful, which indicates that what is haram is when this is done in the pursuit of beauty, but if it were done as a form of treatment because of some problem or deformity in the teeth, then there is nothing wrong with it. And Allah knows best. (al-Nawawi, commentary on Sahih Muslim, 13/107) We should point out here that cosmetic surgeons do not distinguish between cases of serious need and other cases. Their concern is to earn money and satisfy their customers. Materialists and proponents of freedom think that man is free and can do whatever he wants with his body, but this is wrong; the body belongs to Allah and He can command whatever He wills concerning it. Allah has told us about the ways in which Iblis (Shaytan) promised to lead people astray, one of which is (interpretation of the meaning): and indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allah. [al-Nisa 4:119] Haram cosmetic surgical procedures There are cosmetic surgical procedures which are haram and are not considered to be excusable; these are seen as tampering with the creation of Allah for the sake of beauty. Examples include: breast enlargement or reduction, and procedures aimed at reversing the signs of ageing, such as face-lifts etc. The Islamic view is that these are not permitted, because there is no urgent need or necessity for them; rather, the aim is to change and tamper with the creation of Allah for reasons of human vanity. This is haram and the one who does it is cursed because it involves two things mentioned in the hadith: pursuit of beauty and changing what Allah has created. Added to this is the fact that these operations are aimed at deceit, and may involve the injection of materials extracted from aborted foetuses. These are very serious crimes. Moreover, many of these operations result in ongoing pain and other side effects, as the specialists themselves say. (See Ahkam al-Jirahah (Rulings on surgery) by Dr. Muhammad Muhammad al-Mukhtar al-Shanqiti). On the basis of the above, we say to you: if the disfigurement that you are dealing with is incidental and is causing you severe embarrassment as well as putting your husband off, for example, and you are not doing this operation for the purpose of making yourself more beautiful, but only to remove or reduce an accidental disfigurement, then there is nothing wrong with doing it, in sha Allah. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <question>Is it permissible for a women to dye her hair brown using a hair dye? And I don't want to use henna because it doesn't work on my hair. (although I know it is sunnah to use it)</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with dyeing your hair brown even if you do not use henna. What is not allowed is to dye one's hair black, because of the hadeeth narrated from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (see question #261 ) . Similarly it is not permitted to dye one's hair in a manner that imitates the kuffaar, like the &quot;punks&quot; why dye their hair in all kinds of colours.

    <title>Ruling on helping a Muslim move to a non-Muslim country</title>
    <question>I need your help in a fiqh issue. My friend wants me to help him in finding a job here in the US. The process as we all know would be that he'll get a job here the company will sponsor him with an H-1. That could in the future convert to Green card with the due process. I know I'm not be in the process of his applying for the Green Card, but the initial step of his landing here I would be part of it. So, is it Islamically okay for me to help someone to land here in the US (I think he wants to move to US &amp; not move back again to Pakistan)- a non-Islamic/Muslim state? I think I would be responsible for that if something goes wrong with him or his family - aqeedah wise?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. If your friend concerning whom you asked this question is a man of religion and insight, who has enough knowledge to protect himself from confusion and doubts, and enough wisdom to protect himself from desires, there is nothing wrong with helping him to move to the non-Islamic country where you live, so that he might gain employment or complete his studies or gain experience, and other similar permissible aims. But if he is a man for whom you fear that he may fall into error, then it is not permissible for you to help him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;. . . Help one another in al-birr and al-taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety), but do not help one another in sin and transgression. . .&quot; [al-Maaidah 5:2] This is what we have learnt from our shaykh, Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Abdullah ibn Baaz, with whose knowledge Allaah has benefitted us.

    <question>Assalam O Alaikum
I am a muslim. My sister has been proposed to by a man who is christian. She has agreed and they are now planning to get married. The man is willing to convert to Islam. I dont know what to do. Do I have any rights to resist this marriage? My parents are totally against this marriage and are deeply concerned, mainly due to the fact that the man is from a different culture and is not a relative.
Please advise me on what to do as I am very confused and time is running out very fast. I will await your reply anxiously. Thankyou.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible for your sister to marry this man unless two conditions are fulfilled: He must enter Islam. Your father must agree because he is her guardian who is responsible for arranging her marriage. If either of these conditions are not fulfilled, then try to stop this evil from happening, whatever it takes. And Allaah is the source of strength.</answer>

    <question>One of the liars claims to know the Unseen. He recites Quraan over people who suffer from epilepsy and tells them to use papers on which he has written as incense, and he gives them amulets to wear. If a person who comes to him for treatment is a wine-drinker, he tells him that he drank wine the day before and that the rest of the wine is to be found in such and such a place, and says that he will not treat him for epilepsy until he gives up drinking wine. Then the person admits it. Please give us a fatwaa (ruling) on this matter. Is it permissible to sit and eat with this person and to greet him with salaam and pray behind him  as he sometimes leads the people in prayer? We have tried to advise him but he did not accept our advice, and says that he is doing the right thing. Please give us a fatwaa, may Allaah reward you.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly this person is a fortune-teller who uses the shayaateen and gets close to them by doing things that they like so that they will tell him some concealed things. He may be offering sacrifices to them, calling them by name, obeying them by disobeying Allaah and eating haraam or impure things, etc. Of course this is kufr and shirk. He must be asked to repent, and if he repents, all well and good  otherwise he must be executed. It is not permissible to pray behind him or to greet him with salaam until and unless he repents.

    <title>The meaning of Verse 173, Al Baqarah</title>
    <question>My question is with reference to Verse #173 of Sura #2. What is the implication of the words, &quot; wamaa uhilla bihi lighairillah&quot;, therein? Do these words prohibit me from accepting or eating any food article (not necessarily of animals slaughtered in names other than of Allah) which are offered here in India, after Fatehakhani done in the names of saintly persons like Abdul Qadar Jeelani?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The meaning of the Quranic Verse: &quot;Forbidden to you (for food) are: ..., and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,...&quot; (Al-Baqarah, or the heifer, V173) , Ibn Kathir (May Allah have mercy on him) said in explanation of the above Verse: &quot;..that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,...&quot; means slaughtered animals on which has been invoked a name other than the name of Allah; such as an idol, an antagonist, an arrow of divination and the like for which Arabs of pre-Islamic periods slaughtered animals. In explanation of Verse 3 of Surat al-Maida, or the table, Ibn Kathir said: &quot;The Verse: &quot;..., and that on which has been invoked the name of other than Allah,...&quot; means that eating of animal food on which, upon slaughtering a name other than Allah is invoked is forbidden because Allah, the Exalted, prescribed that His Great Name be invoked upon slaughtering any of His creatures. It is the unanimous opinion that one is forbidden to select to invoke a name of an idol of any creature upon slaughtering an animal. In explanation of the Verse &quot;... that which is sacrificed on stone (altars)...&quot;, Mujahid and Ibn Jurayj said: Those were stones (altars) put around the Kabah. Ibn Jurayj said: There were 360 stones (altars) at which pre-Islamic Arabs used to slaughter animal ... They would grill meat and put it on these stones.. Allah forbade such act and disallowed eating of such meat even if the name of Allah is invoked on it. Slaughtering of animal at stones (altars) is part of polytheism, which is prohibited by Allah and His Messenger. Comparison should be made to the foregoing to decide the rule for slaughtering of animals on which is invoked other than the name of Allah. All slaughtered animals on which a name other than the name of Allah; such is the name of a prophet, a holy man, an idol, the devil, or an item of worship such as the cross and the like may not be eaten.</answer>

    <title>what food provoke desire?</title>
    <question>Being a single young student living in london. I would like to know which foods increase the sexual desire in the human body, and what element in food is responsible for this.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.We urge you to follow the advice of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) with regard to food. It was narrated that al-Miqdaam ibn MadiYakrab said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: The son of Adam does not fill any vessel worse than his stomach. It is sufficient for the son of Adam to eat a few mouthfuls to give him enough strength. If his desire for food overwhelms him, then let him fill one-third with food, one-third with drink and leave one-third for air. (Narrated by Ibn Maajah, al-Atimah, 3340; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 2704). Hence some of the scholars included this hadeeth under the heading of controlling desires. You should also fast a lot, heeding the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): O young men! Whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, and whoever is not able to do that then let him fast, for it will be a shield for him. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, al-Nikaah, 4677). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) enjoined fasting . So you must also pay attention to the commands of the Allaah, such as lowering the gaze and keeping away from places where men mix with women. If you have the means to get married then hasten to do so, following the command of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) mentioned above. With regard to the effects that different foods have, we suggest you refer to the books of nutritional experts. And Allaah is the Source of strength.</answer>

    <title>Do Muslims Celebrate Birthdays?</title>
    <question>What is the evidence on celebrating birthdays? Is it allowed in Islam?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.The evidence in the Quran and Sunnah indicates that celebrating birthdays is a kind of bidah or innovation in religion, which has no basis in the pure Shariah. It is not permitted to accept invitations to birthday celebrations , because this involves supporting and encouraging bidah. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning): Or have they partners with Allah (false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not allowed? [Al-Shura 42:21] Then We have put you (O Muhammad) on a plain way of (Our) commandment. So follow that, and follow not the desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allah (if He wants to punish you). Verily, the wrongdoers are protectors to one another, but Allah is the Protector of the pious. [Al-Jathiyah 45:18-19] Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow not any awliya (protectors, helpers, etc.) besides Him. Little do you remember! [Al-Araf 7:3] According to sahih reports, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever does something that is not a part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) will have it rejected. (Reported by Muslim); and The best of speech is the Book of Allah and the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The most evil of things are those which have been newly invented (in religion), and every innovation is a going astray. There are many other ahadith that convey the same meaning. Besides being bidah and having no basis in shariah, these birthday celebrations also involve imitation of the Jews and Christians in their birthday celebrations. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, warning us against following their ways and traditions: You would follow the ways of those who came before you step by step, to such an extent that if they were to enter a lizards hole, you would enter it too. They said, O Messenger of Allah, (do you mean) the Jews and Christians? He said, Who else? (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) also said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. For more, please see these answers: 249 , and 128530 . And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>The meaning of Verse 33, Al Rahmaan</title>
    <question>Assalamu'alaikum wbt
Brother,
I would like to seek your assistance in translating the tafsir of surah 55 ayat 33(Since I do not know Arabic): &quot;33. O ye assembly of Jinns and men! if it be ye can pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth pass ye! not without authority shall ye be able to pass!&quot;
Jazakallahu Khair.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.; Verse 33 of Surat al-Rahman, interpretation of the meaning: &quot;O ye assembly of Jinns and men! If you can pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, pass ye! Not without authority shall ye be able to pass!&quot; This challenge from Allaah to all will be on the day of resurrection when all creatures, Jinn and humans, will be assembled and the heavens split apart. Angels will descend from all of heavens and encircle the resurrected. Allah will challenge the people assembled to escape if they can. They will not be able to escape as they will not have the ability or the power to do so with the angels besieging and encircling them from all sides. In explanation of this Verse, Ibn Kathir (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &quot;Meaning that you cannot escape Allaahs power and predestination, which are everywhere around you. You cannot escape Allahs power or break away from His authority or ruling on you. On the day of resurrection, wherever you go, you will be surrounded on all sides by seven rows of angels. No one can pass beyond the zones &quot;without authority&quot; i.e. an order from Allah. Verse 10 of Surat Al-Qiyamah, or the resurrection, says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;(10.) That day will man say: Where is the escape? (11.) By no means! No place of safety! 12. Before thy Lord (alone), that day will be the dwelling.&quot;</answer>

    <title>A couples marriage contract does not need to be renewed if they become Muslim</title>
    <question>If a couple enter Islam, do they have to repeat their marriage contract?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Ibn Qudaamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The marriage contracts of the disbelievers are valid and may be accepted if they become Muslim. There is no need to examine the nature of their marriage contract or how it was done, and it is not essential that their contract should have fulfilled the conditions of the Muslim marriage contract, namely the wali (womans guardian), witnesses and the format of the proposal and acceptance, and so on. There is no difference of opinion among the Muslims concerning that. Ibn Abd al-Barr said: The scholars are unanimously agreed that if a couple become Muslim together at the same time, they remain together on the basis of their (original) marriage contract, so long as there are no ties of blood or via breastfeeding between them. Many people became Muslim at the time of the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him), and their wives also became Muslim, and their marriage contracts were accepted. The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) did not ask them about the conditions of their marriage or how they had got married. This is something that is known via mutawaatir reports and is well established, thus it is certain.</answer>

    <title>A Girl Calling Her Stepfather Daddy or Abi (Father)</title>
    <question>Is it permissable for a child to call her stepfather Abu or Abi as long as she knows who her real father is, and she carried her real father's name? Her real father is muslim, but she calls him daddy, and for the sake of unity in the home, we want her to call her stepfather Abi like the others do.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Before answering this question, it will be useful to shed more light on the issue of adoption and giving a child a name or lineage that is not really his. In Islam, adoption (i.e., giving your name to a child who is not yours) is haraam, and is considered to be a major sin because of the wrongdoing and corruption that result from it. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allaah&quot; [al-Ahzaab 33:5]. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whoever claims knowingly to belong to someone other than his father will be denied Paradise.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, Fath, no. 3982). He also said: &quot;Whoever claims to belong to someone other than his father, will be cursed by Allaah, the angels and all the people, and Allaah will not accept any deeds or excuses from him on the Day of Resurrection.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, in his Saheeh, no. 2433). In his commentary on this hadeeth, al-Nawawi said: &quot;This is clearly stating the emphatic prohibition of claiming to belong to anyone other than one's real father because this involves ingratitude and a denial of the rights of inheritance, as well as cutting family ties and undutifulness to parents.&quot; (al-Nawawi's statement ends). It also involves not carrying out the rules of inheritance, and ignoring the prohibited degrees of marriage to women [i.e. a man may unknowingly marry someone he is not permitted to, such as a sister, when true origins are concealed by not calling a child after his real father - translator's note], etc. If a man wants to sponsor an orphan, the child must still be named after his father, if his name is known; it is not permissible to attribute this child to himself by giving him his name. If the child's real origins are not known, then he should be given an appropriate name by which he may be known to others, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allaah. But if you know not their father's (names, call them) your brothers in faith &quot; [al-Ahzaab 33:5] In answer to your question, which has to do with a girl - for example - addressing the one who is sponsoring her and bringing her up as &quot;Father&quot; or &quot;Daddy,&quot; Shaykh 'Abd al-'Azeez ibn Baaz has issued a fatwa (ruling) stating that this is allowed, because he is acting in the position of a father to her, and we should not be so strict in this matter. Note: If a man is sponsoring a very young girl (less than two years old) he should try to establish the relationship of mahram by letting her breastfeed from his wife, mother or sister, so that she will become his mahram, otherwise he has to make sure that she does not uncover (take off her hijaab) in front of him when she grows up. The exception to this is a step-daughter (his wife's daughter from a previous marriage); she does not have to wear hijaab in front of her mother's husband even if no relationship is established through breastfeeding (al-radaa').</answer>

    <title>Ruling concerning women covering their feet in prayer</title>
    <question>What is the proof that women have to cover their feet during prayer for prayer to be accepted?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The free woman who has attained the age of majority is obliged to cover her entire body during prayer, apart from her face and hands, because all of her is awrah. If she prays and any part of her awrah becomes uncovered, such as a shin or foot or all or part of her head, then her prayer is invalid, because the Prophet said: &quot;Allah will not accept the prayer of a woman who has started to menstruate, except with a khimaar (covering)&quot; (Reported by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Ibn Maajah and al-Tirmidhi, with a saheeh isnaad) Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she asked the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) about a woman who prayed wearing a dir (chemise or upper garment) and a khimaar (head cover), but no izaar (lower garment). He said: &quot;The woman is awrah.&quot; As for the face, the Sunnah is to uncover it during prayer, so long as no non-mahram men are present. According to the majority of scholars, the feet must be covered; some scholars allow uncovering the feet but the majority say the opposite. Abu Dawud reported from Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was asked about a woman who prayed in a khimaar and qamees (dress or gown). She said, &quot;There is nothing wrong with it if the dir (chemise) covers her feet.&quot; In any case, it is better to cover the feet, to be on the safe side. As far as the hands are concerned, there is more leeway: there is nothing wrong with either covering them or uncovering them, although some scholars think that it is better to cover them.

    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.The answer to your question about al-sunan al-rawatib is a Hadith by the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) in which he said: &quot;Allah will build a house in Heaven for whoever is diligent in observing 12 Sunnah Rak'at (as follows): 4 Rak'at before and 2 after the Zhuhr (Midday) Prayer, 2 after the Maghrib (Sunset Prayer), 2 after the Isha (Evening) Prayer and 2 before the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer.&quot; (Hadith sahih narrated by at-Tirmidhi No. 379 and by others.

Anbasah ibn Abi Sufyan quoted Umm Habibah as saying &quot;Allahs Messenger (may peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;A house will be built in Heaven for one who prays 12 Rak'at in a day and evening as follows: 4 Rak'at before and 2 after the Zhuhr Prayer, 2 after the Maghrib Prayer, 2 after the Isha Prayer and 2 before the Fajr Prayer.&quot; (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi under No. 380. He said: The Hadith narrated by Anbasah quoting Umm Habibah in this chapter is a hassan and sahih hadith. It is under No. 6362 in Sahih al-Jami.) The Asr (Late-Afternoon) Prayer has no routine Sunnah (basic recommended voluntary prayer). However, it is mustahab (preferable and recommended) that one prays 4 Rak'at before the Asr Prayer. The 4 Rak'ahs are of less reward and significance in importance of adhering to them compared to the &quot;sunan al-rawatib&quot; described above. The 4 Rak'ahs are the ones intended by the Prophet (may peace and blessings be upon him) in saying: &quot;May Allah have mercy on one who prays 4 rakat before the Asr Prayer.&quot; (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi no. 395 and he declared it a hassan and gharib Hadith. Al-Albany rated the Hadith as hassan in Sahih al-Jami No. 3493.) All the foregoing 4-Rak'ah voluntary prayers are to be prayed two at a time according to Imam ash-Shafi'i and Imam Ahmad.

    <title>Prisoner having intercourse with Wife during the day in Ramadan</title>
    <question>I 'd like you to inform me about the following:
We have brothers her in Brazil return to Islam (one years ago)in prison thanks our Allah. The imprisoned has right to receive his wife during visiting time (Sunday) and sleep with here from 11 to 2 clock. Now the question is that, what they will do in Ramdan(Their wives are not Muslim)?
please could you please inform us about this equation taken in account Right of women through 30 days they are at new time of their Islam specially we haven't Sheikh.
thanks</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.I do not find another solution to this issue, except to request from the prison administration that the time be changed to between maghrib and fajr. This is the time where it is permissible for a man to have sex with his wife. Whatever be the concerns taken into consideration, it is without doubt impermissible for a Muslim, who is obligated to fast to have sex with his wife during the day time of Ramadhan. This is one of the worst things that break the fast and upon committing this act, it is obligatory for the person to free a slave. If this is not possible, then fasting two months consecutively. If they are unable to do that, then feeding 60 poor persons, repenting, and fasting the day one had sex on. It is upon you all to give instruction and advice in a good way. If something happens then repentance and expiation are required. It is hoped that the administrators of the prison will respond to the mentioned suggestions, particularly if they are able to provide individual rights and religious freedoms. May Allah facilitate for you every good and reward you for your struggle. We ask Allah to give firmness to the Muslim brothers who are in prison and to guide their wives. Allah is the guider to the straight path.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on swearing by the Prophet peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)</title>
    <question>I hear many people, when they want to affirm something, saying by the Prophet. Is this permissible?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This swearing by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is haraam, and is a kind of Shirk, because swearing by something implies veneration of it, and a created being cannot venerate another created being. Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever swears by anything other than Allaah is guilty of kufr or shirk. (Saheeh, narrated by Ahmad, 2/125; Abu Dawood, 3251; al-Tirmidhi, 1535). This applies to swearing by the Prophets, angels, righteous people and all other created beings. And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever swears an oath, let him swear by Allaah or else remain silent. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari,4860  al-Fath 8/611 and 6107  al-Fath 10/516; Muslim, 1647; Ahmad, 2/309; Abu Dawood, 3247; al-Nasaai, 3775; al-Tirmidhi, 1545; Ibn Maajah, 2096). With regard to the verses in the Quraan which contain oaths sworn by those sent forth (al-mursalaat), the winds that scatter (al-dhaariyaat), those who pull out (al-naaziaat), the break of day (al-fajr), the Time (al-asr), the forenoon (al-duhaa) and the mansions of the stars (mawaaqi al-nujoom  see al-Waaqiah 56:75), etc., these are oaths sworn by Allaah, and Allaah has the right to swear oaths by whatever He wills, but the created being can swear only be his Lord, may he be exalted.</answer>

   when wet. Please explain in detailWassalaam</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Anything that could be a source of temptation among women must be prevented. So their swimming in clothes that do not cover their awrah (parts of the body which must be covered) properly because they stick to the body is something that is not allowed. If they swim in clothes that cover them, in a place far from the gaze of men, and cover themselves as soon as they come out of the water so that others will not see them in clothes that show the shape or colour of their awrah, then there is nothing wrong with this so long as they adhere to the shari conditions.

    <title>A man accepting Islam can remain married to Christian wife</title>
    <question>I have been considering accepting Islam for a number of years now. However, I am married to a devout Mormon (LDS) woman, and have ... children, whom I have promised to raise in her religion. 
My question has two parts: First, what is the position of a man accepting Islam with a Christian wife, and practicing Islam independently of her, and Second, what of a promise to raise my children in a religion other than Islam. Obviously, I would seek to expose them to Islam, but I am wondering about things such as supporting her desire to have them attend her church, etc.Thanks very much, (name witheld).</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Dear (name witheld), As-salaamu 'ala man ittaba'a al-huda (peace be upon those who follow the true guidance). I was delighted to learn of your serious consideration and possible intention to accept the Islamic religion. No doubt that step would be the greatest thing in the entire NN years of your life. This step is the one that will protect you from the everlasting punishment of Hell and open to you the path to Heaven after death and will result in success and happiness in this life and the hereafter. I advise you to hasten with your decision and do not hesitate and postpone. You seem to me to be of sound wisdom that will lead you the path of truth by the will of God (Allaah). As for your first question, it is permissible in the Islamic religion for a Muslim to marry a woman from the People of the Book (Christain or Jew) if she is chaste (i.e. of high moral character) and virtuous, as Allaah has stated in the noble Qur'aan (interpretation of the meaning of verse number 5 in the chapter entitled &quot;Al-Maa'ida,&quot; The Table): &quot;This day are (all) things Good and pure made lawful unto you. The food of the People of the Book is lawful unto you and yours is lawful unto them. (Lawful unto you in marriage) are (not only) chaste women who are believers, but chaste women among the People of the Book, revealed before your time, when you give them their due dowers, and desire chastity, not lewdness, nor secret intrigues (girlfriends or lovers)...&quot; Based on this verse, your marriage contract will remain valid if you accept Islaam and become a Muslim, and it will not require renewal. Your remaining with your current wife is permissible as long as she is virtuous and chaste in marriage. As for your second question, the child in Islamic law must follow the Muslim among his or her parents, and it is the Muslim parent's right and responsibility to ensure his or her proper upbringing, guidance, and supervision. Your statement that you would seek to expose your children to Islaam is a wise and judicious foresight. And we hope that with the passing of time that they will be convinced of this religion and implement it in their lives. No doubt that you will face some difficulty in convincing your wife to raise your children in the Islamic religion considering the promise you have made to her. However, the use of wisdom and gentle judgment will aid you, God willing, in overcoming this difficulty. This is important especially considering that it is expected that you will exert a concentrated effort in inviting your wife to Islam, since if she accepts it, the problem will be solved from its roots. In any case, and no matter what the results, the first step towards success will be your accepting the religion of Islaam yourself. We pray to God (Allaah) the Almighty and Magnificent that He eases your affairs and brings you success in finding the path of truth and that he guides your entire famliy to Islam. I would be more than happy to dicuss any other questions or concerns you may have. Salaam. Peace.</answer>

    <title>How Often Are Husband and Wife Supposed to Have Intercourse?</title>
    <question>Are a men and women allowed to have sex on their wedding night?
If so, how often are the husband and the wife allowed to have intercourse; once a week and so on?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related How often husband and wife make love Praise be to Allah.How often husband and wife make love Yes, the couple can have intercourse on the first night of their marriage if they want to. There is nothing in the Shari`ah to indicate the number of times a couple may or should have intercourse, because this varies according to circumstances and personal preferences. As long as people vary in their abilities, it is not possible for the Shari`ah to impose a specific number in such cases. But intercourse is the right of the wife and is a duty on the husband . Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Intercourse is a duty on the man  i.e., the husband should have intercourse with his wife  so long as he has no excuse. This is also the opinion of Malik. (al-Mughni, 7/30) Imam al-Bukhari reported from Abd-Allah ibn Amr ibn al-As, who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: O Abd-Allah, have I not heard that you fast all day and stand all night in prayer? I said, Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: Do not do that. Fast and break your fast, stand in prayer and sleep. For your body has rights over you, your eyes have rights over you, and your wife has rights over you. In the commentary on this hadith, it says: The husband should not exhaust himself in worship to the extent that he becomes too weak to fulfil her rights by having intercourse with her and by earning a living. (Fath al-Bari) It is also the wifes right that her husband should spend his nights with her. Ibn Qudamah al-Hanbali said: If he has a wife, he should spend one night in four with her, so long as he has no excuse. (Al-Mughni, 7/28; Kashf al-Qina, 3/144). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: It is obligatory for the husband to have intercourse with his wife as much as is needed to satisfy her, so long as this does not exhaust him physically or keep him away from earning a living If they dispute over this matter, the judge should prescribe more in the way of intercourse just as he may prescribe more in the way of spending. (Al-Ikhtiyarat al-Fiqhiyyah min Fatawa Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah, p. 246) The Shari`ah also requires that a wife be protected from immorality by means of her husband having intercourse with her, as much as is needed to satisfy her and to provide this protection. But there is no way that this can be stated in terms of a specific period of time, such as four months, or more, or less. It should be defined according to the wifes needs and her husbands ability to fulfil her rights All of this applies in normal circumstances, when the husband is present and living with his wife. If the husband is absent from his wife because he is travelling for a legitimate purpose or other legitimate excuse, in this case the husband should try not to be absent from his wife for too long. If he is absent because he is doing something for the benefit of the Muslims as a whole, such as participating in jihad for the sake of Allah or patrolling the borders of Islam, he should be permitted to go back to his family once every four months or less, so that he can spend time with them before returning to his duties in jihad or border patrol. This was the policy of Umar ibn al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him), who stipulated that soldiers and members of the border patrol should be absent from their wives for only four months, after which time they should be brought back and others sent to take their place (Al-Mufassal fi Ahkam al-Marah by Zaydan, 7/239) For more, please see these answers: 1202 , 91968 , 4807 , and 6792 .

    <question>A man was writing on a piece of paper, and whilst he was writing he made a mistake with some of the words. He got very upset, and because he was so angry he cursed the pen and paper [the Arabic wording states that he cursed the religion and the heaven of the pen and paper  Translator]]. Is cursing [the religion and the heaven of] the pen or paper or rock or tree or chair or whatever considered to be Kufr (disbelief)?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Undoubtedly this kind of cursing is haram (impermissible). Even if we say that the pen and paper have no religion in the sense of doing acts of worship, nevertheless the religion is one, and it is Allah Who has subjugated these pens and other tools and made it easy for us to use them, so there is the fear that this cursing may be referred back to Allah. So this person has to repent and seek forgiveness, and not do anything like this again. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>The Meaning of the Verse &quot;And the Moon, We have measured for it mansions ...&quot;</title>
    <question>I am very interested in Islam. I have since 1994 started to read the Qur'an and the Prophets Hadiths (pbuh)since early this year and I have found great spiritual fulfillment in Islam. I will (Insha Allah) soon be receiving Namaaz lessons as I plan on embracing Islam. I am not sure of the meaning of a particular verse in the Qur'an from Surah Ya-Sin and I hope that you can be of help.
And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse) till it returns like the old dried curved date stalk (36:39)
I will appreciate your help. May Allah guide, protect and bless you for all the help you have given to so many people across the world by answering our questions and ending our dilemmas.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. First of all, let me congratulate you for reaching a conviction that Islam is true and that it is the only religion which meets the needs of mans soul and fills it with tranquillity and joy. From the way in which you phrased your question, it is clear that what you have read about Islam has had an effect on you, so much so that if you had not stated that you are Hindu, we would have thought you were Muslim. The most important thing I want to say to you is to advise you to hasten to enter Islam, and do it sooner rather than later. Once a person is convinced of the truth, what reason is there to delay embracing Islam? There is another point which also needs to made clear. Some of those who want to enter Islam delay doing so until they have learnt some practical aspects of this faith, such as how to pray and so on, because they think that they are not fit to enter the religion until they have learnt some of its teachings. This is not correct; once the truth is clear to a person, it is his duty to follow it and enter Islam straight away. Then he can learn about the Quran and Sunnah and broaden his understanding of Islam. The Muslim is required to take learning and practice step by step, as much as he is able to, because no one knows when he or she will die. If a person meets Allaah (dies) with a religion other than Islaam, he will be one of the doomed. Furthermore, a person will not be rewarded and no hasanaat will be recorded for him until after he has entered Islaam, so he will lose a lot of benefits if he delays his Islaam; time wasted can never be recovered. Now let us go back to your question, which has to do with the thirty-ninth aayah of Soorah Yaa-Seen. In this aayah, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And the moon, We have measured for it mansions (to traverse)&quot; [Yaa-Seen 36:39], i.e., We have made it progress through stages by which the passing of months can be measured, just as night and day are known from the sun. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): &quot;They ask you about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage . . .&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:189] &quot;It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light , and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of their years and the reckoning. . .&quot; [Yoonus 10:5] Allaah has given the sun its own light and has given the moon a (reflection) of light, and has made their courses different, so that the sun rises every day and sets at the end of of the day with one unchanging kind of light, but the positions of its rising and setting vary from summer to winter, because of which the days may be long and the nights short, then the days become short and the nights long. The sun is dominant in the day, so it is the heavenly body of the daytime. As for the moon, Allaah has measured for it mansions or stages, so that on the first night of the month it rises as a faint crescent, giving little light, then its light increases in stages and its position gets higher each night. Every time its position is higher, it has more light, even though it is a reflection of the suns light, until its light becomes complete, on the fourteenth of the month, when it is a full moon. Then it starts to decrease until, at the end of the month, it &quot;returns like the old dried curved date stalk&quot; Ibn Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: &quot;This is the stalk of a bunch of dates.&quot; Mujaahid said: &quot;It is a dried stalk.&quot; Ibn Abbaas meant: the stalk of a bunch of dates when it becomes old, dry and bent. (Reference: Tafsir Ibn Katheer). This likening of the moon at the end of the month to an old dried curved date stalk is a beautiful example of eloquence, by choosing a simile from the environment of the first listeners. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on saying I am a Salafi</title>
    <question>I have come to know a person who follows the Salafi dawah and I have read a book about this movement. I believe that the Salafi dawah is correct and that those who follow it have the sound aqeedah (belief), but there are some matters I want to ask about.
How correct is it from an Islamic point of view to use the word Salafi and to describe oneself in this way?
If a person says that he is a Salafi, is he praising himself? Is this considered to be dividing the ummah?
If we tell the Sufis that their madhhab is not correct, and that neither the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions taught it, they will respond that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) or his Companions did not use the word Salafi either, so how should we reply to them?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah? Who are the Salaf? Can you say I am a Salafi? Response to the Sufi claims Your way to salvation Praise be to Allah.Who are Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah? We can answer this question with the following points: Each person is obliged to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. This is the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah and the followers of the righteous predecessors (al-salaf al-salih). Allah says (interpretation of the meanings): Say (O Muhammad): This is my way; I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me with sure knowledge. And Glorified and Exalted be Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the mushrikeen (polytheists those who worship others along with Allah or set up rivals or partners to Allah). [Yusuf 12:108] And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers way, We shall keep him in the oath he has chosen, and burn him in Hell  what an evil destination! [al-Nisa 4:115] Who are the Salaf? Whoever follows the way of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) belongs to the salaf al-salih , even if the people call him something else; by the same token, whoever goes against it and deviates from the Sunnah is an innovator, even if he claims to be a Salafi. Can you say I am a Salafi? If a person calls himself a Salafi to express his gratitude for having been guided to this way, or to clearly distinguish himself from innovation, then this is OK and is allowed in Islam. But if he says it only for the purpose of praising himself, then this is not allowed, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  therefore justify not yourselves [al-Najm 53:32]. Similarly, it is not allowed if it is said in a spirit of tribalism or sectarianism, because such attitudes are forbidden, as is clear from the following story: Jabir ibn Abd-Allah said: A man from the Muhajireen shoved a man from the Ansar from behind, so each mans people gathered around him, saying O Muhajireen (come and help)! or O Ansar (come and help)! News of this reached the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and he said, Stop this, for it is repulsive. Then he said, What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah? What is this call of the people of jahiliyyah? (Reported by Imam Ahmad, 14105; the hadeeth is also to be found in al-Sahihayn). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) called it the call of the people of jahiliyyah and described it as repulsive, even though the words Ansari and Muhajiri are Islamic words, the first referring to those who supported Allah and His Messenger, and the second referring to those who left the land of kufr and migrated to Allah and His Messenger. Why were they described in this manner? Because in this instance, the words were not used in a permissible fashion; the usage was a sectarian and political one that could have led to fighting between the two groups. The same applies to the word Salafi. If the Ahl al-Sunnah and the salaf draw a line between themselves and the innovators, this is not considered to be dividing the ummah, as those who criticize the use of this word think is the case, but this distancing of oneself has to be done in accordance with the degree of bidah  whether it is major or minor  and should be regulated by the overall interests of the Islamic dawah. Response to the Sufi claims The Sufi claims mentioned in the question are not valid. The denunciation is not merely because of the word Sufi, which is a general word that may be applied to things approved of in Islam, such as asceticism (zuhd) and fear of Allah, or it may be applied to innovations such as monasticism and extremism. Rather the denunciation is because of the various types of shirk, major and minor, that are connected with Sufism and its tariqahs . The word Tasawwuf (Sufism) now refers to the Sufi tariqahs and the kinds of innovations they have. Sufism  as is obvious from their books and how Sufis actually are  includes deviant ideas of kufr, such as hulool (incarnation or the belief that the Creator may be indwelling in His creation  exalted be Allah above what they say), ittihad (union) and wahdat al-wujood (pantheism or the unity of existence, which is the belief that the Creator and His creation are the same thing, and that everything in existence is Allah  exalted be Allah above what they say), and going to extremes in what they say about the awliya, in addition to their innovations in the matter of acts of worship and awrad (duas). Your way to salvation The one who is seeking salvation has to work hard to gain beneficial knowledge and do righteous deeds, and he should avoid vain arguments and futile discussions in which there is no benefit. We ask Allah to help us and you to follow the truth and act upon it. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Are the five daily prayers mentioned in the Qur&amp;#8217;aan?</title>
    <question>The Holy Qur'an, Surah 30: Al Rum 17 &quot;SO (GIVE) GLORY TO ALLAH, WHEN YE REACH EVENTIDE AND WHEN YE RISE IN THE MORNING;&quot; 18 &quot;YEA,TO HIM BE PRAISE, IN THE HEAVENS AND ON EARTH; AND IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND WHEN THE DAY BEGINS TO DECLINE.&quot; These verses only mention four prayers,but yet Muslims pray five times a day (plus Sunnah). Why does it not state the fifth prayer? PS. I'am a practicig Muslim (Inshallah) and I'am in no way trying to prove the Qur'an wrong.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.In the Tafseer of this aayah, it is reported that Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The five daily prayers are (mentioned) in the Quraan. He was asked, Where? He said, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): So glorify Allaah when you come up to the evening is maghrib and isha; and when you enter the morning is fajr; in the afternoon is asr; and the time when the day begins to decline is zuhr. Other mufassireen, such as al-Dahhaak and Saeed ibn Jubayr said the same thing. Some of the mufassireen said that these aayat mention only four of the prayers; isha is not mentioned here, but it is mentioned in Soorat Hood, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  and in some hours of the night [Hood 11:114] Most of the mufassireen are of the first opinion. Al-Nahhaas (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The scholars of Tafseer say that the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): So glorify Allaah when you come up to the evening and when you enter the morning [al-Room 30:17] refers to the prayers. Imaam al-Jassaas (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  The prayer is enjoined on the believers at fixed times [mawqootan]. [al-Nisa 4:103]. It was reported that Abd-Allaah ibn Masood said: [Mawqootan means that] Salaah has an appointed time just as Hajj does. It was reported that Ibn Abbaas, Mujaahid and Atiyyah said [that mawqootan means] It is obligatory The word mawqootan means that it is obligatory at certain times. The times are referred to in general terms in this aayah and are explained elsewhere in the Book, without defining precisely when those times start and end  that was explained in detail by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What Allaah mentioned about the times of the prayers in His Book is (interpretation of the meaning): Perform al-Salaah from mid-day till the darkness of the night and recite the Quraan in the early dawn [al-Isra 17:78]. Mujaahid reported from Ibn Abbaas: Mid-day means when the sun has passed its zenith for salaat al-zuhr, and the darkness of the night means the beginning of the night, for salaat al-maghrib. It was also reported from Ibn Umar that mid-day meant the zenith Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And perform al-salaah at the two ends of the day and in some parts of the night [Hood 11:114]. Amr reported from al-Hasan that the two ends of the day means fajr at the first end and zuhr and asr at the other; some parts of the night means maghrib and isha. So according to this opinion the aayah refers to all five prayers. Layth reported from al-Hakam from Abu Ayyaad that Ibn Abbaas said: This aayah mentions all five prayers together. So glorify Allaah when you come up to the evening refers to maghrib and isha, and when you enter the morning refers to fajr, in the afternoon is asr; and the time when the day begins to decline is zuhr. Something similar was also reported from al-Hasan. Abu Razeen reported from Ibn Abbaas:  and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before (its) setting [Qaaf 50:39  interpretation of the meaning] refers to the prescribed prayers.  and glorify the praises of your Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and during some of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day, that you may become pleased with the reward which Allaah shall give you. [Ta-Ha 20:130  interpretation of the meaning] This aayah also includes the times of the prayers. All of these aayaat mention the times of the prayers. Ahkaam al-Quraan by al-Jassaas, Baab Mawaaqeet al-Salaah. What you should also know is that the Quraan does not contain details of all the rules. The Quraan mentions many rules, but it also tells us that the Sunnah is a source of evidence in which many rules are mentioned in detail that are not mentioned in the Quraan. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):  and We have also sent down to you (O Muhammad) the reminder and the advice (the Quraan), that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them and that they may give thought. [al-Nahl 16:44]  and whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it [al-Hashr 59:7] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: I have been given the Quraan and something like it with it (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 16546; this is a saheeh hadeeth). Whether the rules were narrated in the Quraan or in the Sunnah, all of it is true and right, and all of it has one source, which is the wahy or revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.</answer>

    <title>Appointing an ameer (leader)</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on appointing someone
   as an ameer when not travelling, such as when a group of young men are sharing a flat or
   in a camp that is held within the city or elsewhere?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The reports that have been narrated concerning appointing an ameer refer specifically to when people are travelling, because when people are travelling they need to be able to refer their opinions to a leader or ameer. But when people are not travelling, usually each individual is busy with his own affairs and they do not need an ameer. But they may appoint someone to be the head of their society or group, so if for example they are living in a flat, they may say we need someone to organize our affairs in this flat, so we will appoint So and so to be our head or ameer. Then they can discuss with him the running of this households affairs, such as what kind of food to have, setting times of rest, deciding what needs to be bought, and so on, so they discuss these things with him and agree to accept what he says. This is correct, in sha Allaah.</answer>

    <title>Can the Muslims live in peace in Palestine?</title>
    <question>I am speaking under correction. Please do correct me if I don't have my facts right:
According to The Bible there is no country such as Israel, only Palestine. The Jew and the Arab, both stemming from Abraham is in fact half brothers. So why can they not live in harmony in a new country called Palestine?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Your question may be answered by the following points: There is no doubt that the Prophet of Allaah Ibraaheem (Abraham) was a pure monotheist, and he was not among the polytheists and disbelievers. Although the Jews are among the offspring of Ibraaheem (peace be upon him), they went against his way by associating partners in worship with Allaah and claiming that Uzayr (Ezra) was a son of God. They said that God is miserly and that His hand is tied up, and they said, He is poor and we are rich. They also said that when God created the heavens and the earth in six days, He got tired, so He rested on the Sabbath day exalted be Allaah far above all that they say about Him. They also likened the attributes of God to human attributes (anthropomorphism) and killed the Prophets, etc., etc. Once this distinction and contrast is made clear, there can be no brotherhood between a monotheistic believer and a polytheistic disbeliever, as Allaah says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their people, Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah. We have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred forever, - until you believe in Allaah Alone, except the saying of Ibraaheem to his father: Verily, I will ask for forgiveness (from Allaah) for you, but I have no power to do anything for you before Allaah. Our Lord! In You (Alone) we put our trust, and to You (Alone) we turn in repentance, and to You (Alone) is (our) final Return, - Certainly, there has been in them an excellent example for you to follow, - for those who look forward to (the Meeting with) Allaah (for the reward from Him) and the Last Day. And whosoever turn away, then verily, Allaah is Rich (Free of all wants), Worthy of all Praise. [al-Mumtahinah 60:4,6] Once this separation and enmity is clear, it is unavoidable that there will be hostility and disavowal and the resulting struggle against the enemies of Allaah. So long as the laws and wisdom of Allaah dictate that there should the distinction between believers and disbelievers, there has to be this clearly-stated enmity. There can be no change to the laws of Allaah. There cannot be harmony between Jews who are usurpers and aggressors, who have oppressed and persecuted others, and who are known for their treachery and corruption throughout the world, historically and in the present age and the purely monotheistic Muslim owners of the land, whose menfolk the Jews have killed, and imprisoned their sons, and destroyed their homes, and taken possession of their lands by force, and prevented them from earning a proper living, and carried out chemical and radiational experiments on their prisoners, and taken organs from them for transplant into Jewish patients and all other kinds of persecutions and atrocities. In addition to this, the Jews are people of treachery and betrayal; it is not possible to trust them at all. Their current conduct bears this out: is there any treaty or agreement signed by them that they have actually fulfilled? This is no big surprise for the Muslims, who know what Allaah has said in His Book about the Jews (interpretation of the meaning): Is it not (the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throws it aside? Nay! The truth is most of them believe not. [al-Baqarah 2:100]. Moreover, if the Muslims agreed to live in peace with the Jews, who would be in charge? One of the basic principles of Islam is that Islam should prevail, not be prevailed over. One of the conditions for People of the Book (Jews and Christians) living with Muslims in a Muslim country is that they should live under certain conditions (shuroot ahl al-dhimmah) in return for the security and protection afforded them by the Muslims. One of the most important of these conditions is that they should not openly display their shirk and kufr (polytheistic disbelief) in the Muslim lands, whether by word or deed. As the Muslims and Jews are enemies residing in opposing religious and doctrinal camps, it is not possible for them to be brought together unless one is made to submit to the other by force. Indeed, the Jews now are not allowing the Muslims to remain in their homes, even if there was no provocative action on the part of the Muslims; they are seizing the Muslims property by force, building their settlements on the Muslims lands and expelling the Muslims by any means. They have expelled millions to the neighbouring countries, which have accommodated them in the so-called Palestinian refugee camps. Finally, although the Muslims nowadays are in a position of weakness and humiliation because they have turned away from their religion and are unable to fight the Jews, take back their stolen lands and impose the rule of Islamic shareeah in Palestine, this does not mean that this will always be the case until the end of the world. Things have to change, and one of the indications of this is the hadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who informed us of some things that are to happen in the future. He was supported by Revelation from his Lord; he did not speak of his own whims and desires, but of that which was revealed to him. He said: You will fight the Jews and will prevail over them, so that a rock will say, O Muslim! There is Jew behind me, kill him! (Reported by Muslim, 2921; al-Bukhaari, 2926). According to a report narrated by Muslim from Abu Hurayrah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Hour [the Day of Judgement] will not begin until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. A Jew will hide behind a rock or a tree, and the rock or tree will say, O Muslim, O slave of Allaah! There is a Jew behind me, come and kill him! except for the gharqad (box thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews. (Reported by Muslim, 2922). We would like to express our appreciation for your question, your desire to find out the truth, and the polite and eloquent manner in which your inquiry was phrased. We invite you to believe in Allaah as your Lord, in Islam as your religion, and in Muhammad as your Prophet, for this by Allaah will save you and benefit you and protect you in this world, in the grave after death, and in the Hereafter on the Day of Reckoning. May Allaah help us and you to do all that is good.</answer>

    <title>Dogs as food</title>
    <question>A Muslim kept a watchdog. When it
   became old, he called in some non-muslim, dog-eating people from a neighbouring tribe and
   gave them the dog, so they would slaughter and eat it. The dog sensed it and was
   distressed, but the tribal people thanked him for his kindness towards them. Has the
   Muslim acted correctly?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to eat dogs, or to give them to people who will eat them, because it is haraam to eat them or to help anyone else to eat them. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Every animal that has fangs is haraam. (Reported by Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah, may Allaah be pleased with him). According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu Thalabah al-Khashani (may Allaah be pleased with him), the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade the eating of every carnivorous animal that has fangs. (Agreed upon). Dogs are carnivores that have fangs. You have to repent to Allaah for what you have done, and Allaah is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on Intercourse with a Woman in her rectum</title>
    <question>Please accept my apology if this questions offends, but in the pursuit of Islamic knowledge, we cannot afford to be shy for fear that if we are not well advised, we may commit a sin.
I have been advised by a friend that there is a &quot;qawl&quot; (opinion) among some ulamaa' (scholars) that it is permissible to conduct anal sex (anal penetration) (between man and wife only) during the time of the wife's haydh (menstruation).
Is this correct?
Please also advise the laws and penalties relevant to it.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Your apology is accepted. Striving to understand the rulings of Sharee'ah in this and similar matters is not haraam or shameful; it is necessary. As regards your question, anal intercourse with one's wife is a major sin, whether it occurs at the time of menstruation or not. The Prophet SAWS (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) cursed the one who does this: &quot;Cursed is the one who approaches his wife in her rectum&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad, 2/479; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5865). The Prophet SAWS (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) also said: &quot;The one who has intercourse with a menstruating woman, or with a woman in her rectum, or who goes to a fortune-teller, has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, no. 1/243; see also Saheeh al-Jaami', 5918). In spite of the fact that many wives of sound nature refuse this, there are some husbands who threaten their wives with divorce if they do not obey them (in this matter), and some even deceive their wives, who are too shy to ask scholars about it, into thinking that it is permissible. The Prophet SAWS (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allah be upon Him) said that a man may approach his wife in any way he likes, from the front or the back, so long as intercourse takes place in the place from through which a child is born. There is no doubt that the rectum is the place from which waste matter is expelled, not the place from which a child is born. Another reason why some may commit this immoral act is that they enter upon what should be a clean married life with some jaahili (ignorant) traditions and odd practices, or with memories of scenes from indecent movies, for which they have not repented to Allaah. It is known that this act is forbidden even if both partners agree to it. Mutual consent to a haraam deed does not make it halaal. I ask Allah to bestow upon us a proper understanding of His religion and to make us adhere to its limits, for He is the All-Hearing, the One Who answers prayers.</answer>

    <title>Differences in Prayer for Men and Women</title>
    <question>Is there any prove from the Sunnah or ijtihad of the Sahaba that the praying (salat) of a woman is on some points different from the man, like it is in the Hanafi madhhab?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah. The general principle is that women are equal to men in all religious rulings, because of the hadeeth &quot;Women are the twin halves of men&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad and classified as saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami 1983), except when there is evidence (daleel) of a specific ruling which applies only to women. One of the cases in which the scholars mention specific rules for women is prayer, where there are differences as follows: Women do not have to give adhaan or iqaamah, because adhaan requires raising the voice, which women are not permitted to do. Ibn Qudaamah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &quot;We know of no difference between the scholars (on this point).&quot; (Al-Mughni maa al-Sharh al-Kabeer, 1/438). All of the womans body is awrah and must be covered during prayer, except for her face, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;No prayer will be accepted from an adult woman unless she wears a khimaar (head-cover). (Reported by the five Muhadditheen) There is some dispute as to whether her heels and feet should be covered. The author of al-Mughni (2/328) said: &quot;As for the rest of the free womans body, it must be covered during prayer. If any part becomes uncovered, it renders her prayer invalid, except if only a little bit is uncovered. Maalik, al-Oozaai and al-Shaafii said the same. The woman should keep her limbs close to her body during rukoo and sujood, and not spread them out, because this is more modest and covering. (Al-Mughni 2/258). Al-Nawawi said: &quot;Al-Shaafii said, in al-Mukhtasar: there is no difference between men and women in prayer, except that women should keep the parts of their bodies close to one another, and they should make their stomachs touch their thighs during sujood. This is more covering and preferable, in rukoo and the rest of the prayer too.&quot; (See al-Majmoo 3/429). It is preferable for women to pray in congregation, led by one of their number, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told Umm Waraqah to lead the women of her household in prayer. There is some difference among scholars on this matter. (See al-Mughni, 2/202 and al-Majmoo al-Nawawi, 4/84-85). The woman leading the prayer should read aloud as long as no non-mahram man can hear her. It is permissible for women to go out and pray in the mosque with men, although their prayer at home is better for them, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Do not prevent the women from going out to the mosques, even though their homes are better for them.&quot; (For more details on this matter, see Question#973). Imaam al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said (al-Majmoo 3/455): &quot;Women differ from men in congregational prayer in a number of ways: (1) Congregational prayer is not required of them in the same way as it is of men. (2) The imam of a group of women stands in the middle of the (first) row. (3) (If one woman and one man are praying), she should stand behind him, not next to him. (4) If women are praying in rows behind men, the back rows are better for them than the front rows. What we can learn from the above is that women and men are forbidden to mix.

    <title>The Unlettered Prophet</title>
    <question>Is there any evidence that the Prophet Muhammad was unable to read or write?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read not write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat and the Injeel, - he commands them for al-Maroof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islaam has ordained); and forbids them from al-Munkar (i.e., disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islaam has forbidden); he allows them as lawful al-Tayyibaat (i.e., all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful al-khabaaith (i.e., all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), he releases them from their heavy burdens (of Allaahs Covenant) and from the fetters (bindings) that were upon them. So those who believe in him (Muhammad), honor him, help him and follow the light (the Quraan) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.&quot; [al-Araaf 7:157] Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: &quot;Allaah says al-ummi. Ibn Abbaas, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: Your Prophet was unlettered, unable to read or write or calculate. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Quran), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand . . . [al-Ankaboot 29:48].&quot; Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of the second aayah quoted [al-Ankaboot 29:48]: &quot;Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this Quraan), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand . . . i.e., you (O Muhammad) lived among your people for a while before you brought this Quraan to them, and you never read any book or were able to write anything. Everyone among your people and others knows that you are an unlettered man, who does not read or write. This is how he was described in the previous Books as Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read not write whom they find written with them in the Tawraat and the Injeel, - he commands them for al-Maroof (i.e., Islamic monotheism and all that Islaam has ordained); and forbids them from al-Munkar (i.e., disbelief, polytheism of all kinds, and all that Islaam has forbidden) . . . [al-Araaf 7:157]. Hence the Prophet will remain unable to write even one line or one letter, until the Day of Resurrection. He had scribes who would write down in front of him the Revelation and letters to different regions. . . . Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): . . . In that case, indeed, the followers of falsehood might have doubted. [al-Ankaboot 29:48], i.e., if you had been good at it (reading and writing), some of the ignorant people would have doubted you and said that you had learnt this from the previous Books left by the Prophets. Indeed, they say this despite the fact that they know he was unlettered and unable to write, as it says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): And they say: &quot;Tales of the ancients, which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and afternoon.&quot; [al-Furqaan 25:5]&quot; Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them (from the filth of disbelief and polytheism), and teaching them the Book and al-Hikmah (al-Sunnah). And verily, they had been before in manifest error.&quot; [al-Jumuah 62:2] Al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his tafseer of this aayah: &quot;It was said: the unlettered ones means those who do not write. Such were the Quraysh. Mansoor reported from Ibraaheem, who said: Al-ummi (the unlettered one) is the one who neither reads nor writes. &quot;A Messenger from among themselves&quot; means Muhammad , who was unlettered and never read a book nor learned how. Al-Mawardi said: What is good about the fact that Allaah sent an unlettered Prophet? There are three things: (i) his message fulfilled the foretelling of the previous Prophets; (ii) this made him similar to and closer to other Prophets (illiterates); (iii) this would eliminate all suspicion that he had learned the message he preached from books and writings that he had read.&quot; I say: all of this is evidence of the miraculous nature and truth of his Prophethood. (The above has been summarized from the Tafseer of al-Qurtubi, may Allaah have mercy on him).</answer>

    <title>Is It Haram to Have a Girlfriend or a Boyfriend?</title>
    <question>I am deeply in love with a Muslim man and want to marry him. I know that Allah forbids girlfriend-boyfriend relationships, and feel very sorry in my heart for our relationship. I feel that because we have been in this relationship which is abhorred by Allah, he will never marry me because he has lost respect for me. What does the Quran say about having a girlfriend or a boyfriend?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related The Quran prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends The Sunnah prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends The ruling of having girlfriends and boyfriends in Islam Praise be to Allah.The Quran prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  Wed them with the permission of their own folk and give them their mahr (dowry) according to what is reasonable; they should be chaste, not adulterous, nor taking boyfriends [al-Nisa 4:25] In his commentary on this ayah, Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Muhsanat [translated as chaste] means that they should be pure, not indulging in zina (unlawful sexual conduct), hence they are described as not being musafihat , which means promiscuous women who do not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them. Regarding the phrase wa la muttakhidhati akhdan (nor taking boyfriends), Ibn 'Abbas said: al-musafihat means those who are known to commit zina, meaning those who will not refuse anyone who wants to commit immoral acts with them. Ibn 'Abbas also said: muttakhidhati akhdan means lovers. A similar interpretation was narrated from Abu Hurayrah, Mujahid, al-Shabi, al-Dahhak, Ata al-Khurasani, Yahya ibn Abi Kathir, Muqatil ibn Hayyan and al-Saddi. They said: (it means) lovers. Al-Hasan al-Basri said: It means a (male) friend. Al-Dahhak also said: wa la muttakhidhati akhdan also means a woman who has just one boyfriend or lover with whom she is happy. Allah has also forbidden this, meaning marrying her so long as she is in that situation Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Made lawful to you this day are al-tayyibat [all kinds of halal (lawful) foods]. The food of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is lawful to you and yours is lawful to them. (Lawful to you in marriage) are chaste women from the believers and chaste women from those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before your time, when you have given their due mahr (bridal money given by the husband to the wife at the time of marriage), desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in the Oneness of Allah and in all the other articles of Faith, then fruitless is his work, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers. [al-Maidah 5:5] Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy on him) said: Muhsineen ghayr musafiheen wa la muttakhidhi akhdan (desiring chastity (i.e., taking them in legal wedlock), not committing illegal sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends ). Just as Allah imposed the condition of chastity on women, meaning that they refrain from zina, so it is also imposed on men. The man must also be pure and chaste. So they should be ghayr musafiheen, meaning they should not be adulterers who do not refrain from sin and do not refuse any who come to them (for immoral purposes). Nor should they be muttakhidhi akhdan, meaning those who have girlfriends or female lovers with whom they have an exclusive relationship, as quoted above from Surat al-Nisa. (The one with many lovers or the one with just one lover) are both the same. For this reason Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal (may Allah have mercy on him) said that it is not right to marry a promiscuous woman unless she has repented, or to arrange a marriage of such a woman to a chaste man, so long as she is still conducting herself in this manner. Similarly, he (Ahmad) says that it is not right for a promiscuous man to marry a chaste woman unless he repents and gives up his immoral conduct, because of this ayah We will discuss this matter in further detail after quoting the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): Let no man guilty of fornication or adultery marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever: nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman: to the believers such a thing is forbidden. [al-Nur 24:3] The Sunnah prohibits having girlfriends or boyfriends Among the stories that show that it is forbidden to have girlfriends or to marry them is the story of Marthad ibn Abi Marthad, who used to smuggle Muslim prisoners-of-war from Makkah to Madinah. There was a prostitute in Makkah, called Anaq, who had been a friend of Marthads. Marthad had promised to take one of the prisoners from Makkah to Madinah. He said: I came to the shade of one of the gardens of Makkah on a moonlit night, then Anaq came and saw my shadow by the garden. When she reached me, she recognized me and said: Marthad? I said, Marthad. She said: Welcome! Stay with us tonight. I said, O Anaq, Allah has forbidden zina (unlawful sexual relations)  I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and asked him, O Messenger of Allah, should I marry Anaq? The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) remained silent and did not answer me at all, until the ayah Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman; to the believers such a thing is forbidden [al-Nur 24:3  Yusuf Alis translation] was revealed. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: O Marthad, Let no man guilty of adultery or fornication marry any but a woman similarly guilty, or an unbeliever; nor let any but such a man or an unbeliever marry such a woman, so do not marry her. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3101; he said: it is a hasan gharib hadith). Abd-Allah ibn Mughaffal reported that there was a woman who had been a prostitute during the days of ignorance (before Islam). A man passed by her, or she passed by him, and he touched her. She said: Stop it! (Mah! A word connoting a rebuke or denunciation). Allah has done away with shirk and had brought Islam. So he left her alone and went away, still looking at her, until he walked into a wall, hitting his face. He came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and told him what had happened. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: You are a man for whom Allah wishes good. When Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, wishes good for His slave, He hastens the punishment for his sin, so that it is dealt with before the Day of Resurrection. (Reported by al-Hakim, 1/349, who said this hadith is sahih according to the conditions of Muslim, and al-Dhahabi agreed with him. See Sahih al-Jami, 308). The ruling of having girlfriends and boyfriends in Islam These ayat and ahadith clearly indicate that it is haram (forbidden) for men to have any kind of friendship or relationship with non-mahram women (women to whom they are not closely-related and to whom they could get married). The evil consequences and misery caused by such relationships are obvious to anyone who observes real life. A similar question has been asked under #2085 . We ask Allah to keep us far away from that which is forbidden, to protect us from all that may earn His wrath and to keep us safe from a painful punishment. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

    <title>Ruling on joining in the kaafir festivals</title>
    <question>I see many &quot;Muslims&quot; joining in Christmas and other celebrations. Is there any daleel from the Quran and Sunnah that I can present to them to show that these are indeed very sinful practices?.</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to join in the kaafir festivals for the following reasons: Firstly: because this entails imitating or resembling them, and Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Narrated by Abu Dawood). This is a serious warning. Abd-Allaah ibn al-Aas said: Whoever lives in the land of the mushrikeen and celebrates their Nawrooz (New Year) and their Mahrajaan (festivals), and imitates them until he dies, he will be a loser on the Day of Resurrection. Secondly: taking part in their festivals is a kind of befriending them and showing love for them. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliyaa (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Awliyaa of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Awliyaa), then surely, he is one of them [al-Maaidah 5:51] O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists) as friends, showing affection towards them [al-Mumtahanah 60:1] Thirdly: festivals are the matter of religion and beliefs, not the matter of worldly customs, as is indicated by the hadeeth: Every nation has its Eid, and this is our Eid. Their Eid or festival reflects their corrupt beliefs of Kufr and Shirk. Fourthly: And those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass it by with dignity [al-Furqaan 25:72  interpretation of the meaning]. The scholars interpreted this aayah was referring to the festivals of the mushrikeen. It is not permissible to give any of them cards for their festivals, or to sell them cards or any of the other things they need for their festivals such as lights, trees or food  including turkey, candy canes, etc. We have already answered a similar question, for more details please see Question #947.</answer>

    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.You must repent to Allaah for what you have done and stop whatever haraam deed you are doing, whether it is major or minor. If you feel that in order to stop doing this haraam deed you have to marry this woman even if your parents do not agree, then go ahead and marry her, because that is the lesser of two evils, and try to please them in other ways as much as you can.

    <title>The people of Paradise will remember the life of this world</title>
    <question>In Paradise will the servants of Allah remember the Previous world, and therefore, be able to desire Things that they desired on earth?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. There is evidence in the Quraan that the people of Paradise will remember the life of this world. For example, in Soorat al-Toor, Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: Aforetime, we were afraid with our families (of the punishment of Allaah). But Allaah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful.&quot; [al-Toor 52:25-28] They will also remember the evil people who tried to make the people of faith have doubts and called them to kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Then they will turn to one another, mutually questioning. A speaker of them will say, Verily, I had a companion (in the world), who used to say, &quot;Are you among those who believe (in resurrection after death), (that) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punishment (according to our deeds)?&quot; [al-Saffaat 37:50-53] They will remember the trials and tribulations they went though in this world, with regard to themselves, their children, their families and their wealth, and they will say joyfully: &quot; All praise and thanks be to Allaah, Who has removed from us (all) grief. Verily, our Lord is indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate (good deeds and to recompense).&quot; [Faatir 35:34] They will also be reminded of this life when they see the fruits which will resemble those which they used to eat in this world, but whose size and taste are different. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: This is what we were provided with before, and they will be given things in resemblance (i.e., in the same form but different in taste)&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:25] They will also recall their duaas in times of hardship, when they raised their hands to heaven asking for their deeds to be accepted and for help to do righteous deeds and to be included among those who would inherit blessings. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And some of them draw near to others, questioning, saying: Aforetime, we were afraid with out families (of the punishment of Allaah). But Allaah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire. Verily, we used to invoke Him (Alone) before. Verily, He is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful.&quot; [al-Toor 52:25-28] As regards the matter of them desiring something like the blessings of this world, they will in fact desire something better than that, because even the person who is the lowest in status in Paradise will enjoy something like ten times the joys of this world. Abdullaah ibn Masood said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: I know who will be the last person to be brought out of Hell and the last person to enter Paradise. It will be a man who will come out of Hell crawling. Allaah will say to him, &quot;Go and enter Paradise.&quot; So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, &quot;O Lord, I found it full.&quot; Allaah will say to him a second time, &quot;Go and enter Paradise.&quot; So he will go there and think that it is full, so he will come back and say, &quot;O Lord, I found it full.&quot; Allaah will say to him, &quot;Go and enter Paradise, for there you will have something like the world and ten times more.&quot; The man will say, &quot;Are You making fun of me (or are You laughing at me), and You are the King of all?&quot; - and I saw the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) smiling so broadly that his back teeth could be seen. He used to say, That is the person who is lowest in status in Paradise.&quot; [Agreed upon; this version is reported by Muslim, no. 272] Everything that the people of Paradise desire will be theirs, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; (there will be) therein all that ones inner-self could desire, all that the eyes could delight in, and you will abide therein forever.&quot; [al-Zukhruf 43:71] A number of ahaadeeth state that the people of Paradise will have their desires for children or to grow things fulfilled, without having to wait for them. Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) was speaking about the people of Paradise one day when a Bedouin was present. He described how a man of the people of Paradise will ask his Lords permission to grow some plants. (In Arabic, the past tense is used here to show that this will undoubtedly happen). Allaah will ask him, &quot;Do you not already have all that you want?&quot; He will say, &quot;Yes, but I like to grow things.&quot; So he will go and plant his seeds, and within the blinking of an eye they will grow, ripen, be harvested and piled up like mountains. Allaah will say, &quot;Here you are, O son of Adam, nothing makes you satisfied!&quot; The Bedouin said, &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, you will find that he is either from Quraysh or the Ansaar, for they are the ones who like to grow things; we dont like to grow anything!&quot; The Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) smiled broadly. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 6965). Ibn Hijr reported the following hadeeth in Fath al-Baari; from it we learn that whatever worldly desires one wishes for in Paradise can be fulfilled. Abu Saeed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;If the believer in Paradise wishes for a child, it will be conceived and delivered, and will grow to the desired age in an instant.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2487. Abu Eesaa said: This is a ghareeb hasan hadeeth; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 6649) We ask Allaah to make us among the people of Paradise by His Grace and Mercy. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Circumcision and Choosing a Name for a New Muslim</title>
    <question>Assalam alaikum
I am a young man from Denmark, who for some time have been interested in Islam. I have now reached a point where I am absolutely sure that I want to become a Muslim. My questions are as follows:
- Since I would have to be circumcised to become Muslim (this I gladly accepts) I would like to know how this comes about. Is it done by a doctor, an imam or by oneself?
- I feel changing my name as I become Muslim is a truly happy occasion. But I would like to now which of the following names you find to be most suitable as my new first name?

Qasim
Aasim
Taymullah
or Sayyid


I will be very grateful indeed to get a response to my letter.
Sincerely</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.All Praise is due to Allah, All Praise is due to Allah for having guided you to this path which you would not have been guided to without Allaahs Guidance. Your interest in embracing our religion is very pleasant news for us tonight. We pray to Allaah that you successfully embrace Islam and become steadfast on it. As for your first question, if circumcision does not cause you harm, you can have it performed by a surgeon whos experience and skill you trust. If it would cause you harm, then you dont have to do it and that will not adversely affect your Islam, InShaa'a Allah (Allah Willing). As for changing your name, note that the most beloved names to Allah are: Abdul-llah (The Slave/worshipper of Allah) and Abdul-Rahman (The Slave/worshipper of the Most Merciful one of the names of Allah). This came to us in the authentic Hadeeth (sayings) of the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon Him) which was narrated by Muslim (hadeeth number 3975). If you want us to choose one of the names that you have listed, you can use Aasim which means: protector preserver defender guarder. We pray to Allaah for you to have a Blissful and Pleasant life in the shadow of the Great Islam.</answer>

    <title>When a pregnant woman feels contractions, should she stop praying, and does she have to makeup the missed prayers?</title>
    <question>When does a woman in labour (for childbirth) stop performing the salah? Does she still perform the salah if she is having contractions but no fluid has come from her body yet?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.We put the following question to Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen, may Allaah preserve him: If a woman whose pregnancy has reached full term passes blood and has pains, but she does not know whether these are the contractions that will lead to childbirth or contractions that will later ease off [practice contractions, also known as Braxton-Hicks contractions], should she pray or not? He answered, may Allaah preserve him: Of course, there are two things we may assume here: The first is that the pregnancy will continue without contractions. The second is that the apparent case is that these are contractions, so she should stop praying. If this is what usually happens to her, and she may carry on having contractions for four or five days without giving birth, then in this case she should still pray. Question: If she acts upon the second assumption, then the contractions ease off, should we tell her to make up the prayers she has missed? Answer: It is preferable to make them up, because she took her decision on the basis of an assumption. In summary, then: If this woman usually has contractions for a number of days  more than two or three  then this is not nifaas and she should pray. If that is not what usually happens, then we assume that it is nifaas in the sense that she should stop praying. If she stops praying, then it turns out that it was not nifaas, then in this case we say that if she makes up the prayers she has missed, this is good, and if she does not make them up, there is nothing wrong with that because she acted on an assumption. And Allh knows best.</answer>

    <title>When to Start Ordering the Young to Fast</title>
    <question>The young is told to start praying when they are seven year old and they are to be punished for not performing prayer when they ten, according to Sunnah. Does the same rule apply for fasting?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The young boy is ordered to fast when he reaches the age of 7 is if he is physically capable of bearing it. (Some Muslim scholars that he should be physically reprimanded if he does not fast by the age of 10, which is the same rule that is applied to prayer; refer to Al Mughni 3/90). The boy will get a reward for fasting and his parents will get a reward for teaching him well and guiding him to that which is good. Al Rubayyi bint Muawwadh (may Allaah be pleased with her) said about fasting Aashouraa at the time when it was mandatory to fast it and not voluntary: we used to make our young boys fast, and we made them a toy made out of wool. If one of the boys cried [wanting] food, we would give him [the toy to distract him] until it was time to break the fast.&quot; (Al Bukhari Fath # 1960). (Ashouraa is the tenth day of the month of Muharram. Although fasting this day is now voluntary the majority of Muslims usually fast.) Some people are quite lenient and lax when it comes to making their children fast. A situation may even arise where the young child feels enthusiastic and chooses to fast and is physically capable of doing so, then his father or mother order him to break his fast claiming that it is out of sympathy. Little do they know that real sympathy is in stressing the importance of fasting and teaching the child about it. Allaah said in Surat ul-Tahreem (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;O you who believe! Ward yourselves and your families off from a fire (Hell) whose fuel is of men and stones, over which are appointed angels stern and severe, who do not disobey the commands they receive from Allaah, and execute that which they are commanded.&quot; We must pay extra attention to the young girl when she first starts fasting after she reaches puberty. There is a possibility that she will fast while she has her period (the first time) out of shame or shyness, and end up not making up the days later on. Also see the Book &quot;70 Matters Related to Fasting&quot;.</answer>

    <title>Time for Imsaak (Starting the Fast) when the Calendar Times are Different</title>
    <question>There are apparent discrepancies in the times of Salaat-ul Fajr stated on the different timetables distributed by the various mosques of the same town or city. Would it be a safer practice if one was to follow the earliest of those times for the purpose of Imsaak (abstaining from eating, drinking, etc.)?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to eat, drink, etc. until one is certain of the time of Fajr (interpretation of the meaning): eat and drink until the time where the white and black thresholds of Al-Fajr is evident to you [Soorat-ul Baqarah] So, this means it is permissible to continue eating and drinking unless it is evident for one that it is time for Fajr. Fajr can be defined as the white light spreading across the horizon from the eastern side. If one was unable to sight Al-Fajr and there was no one else who could tell him about it through means such as raising the Azaan (The call to prayers), then one should follow the timetable that, according to the best of his knowledge, is the most accurate. This accuracy is usually established through experience or by asking experts or the earlier Muslim residents of the area.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on Repeating Salat ul Eid(Holiday Prayer) in the Same Place</title>
    <question>Some mosques in our city hold Salaat-ul Eed more than once on Eed day, i.e. hold one congregational Salaat say, at 8.00 AM, followed by another one at 9.00 AM and so on. This is due to the limitations of their small size and its numbers. Is this permissible?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is rather unusual [in my opinion] to raise this kind of question. We ought to ask ourselves; is it really beyond our reach to have a large enough place, even if it were to be in a park, a stadium, etc., which would be sufficient to cater for the large number of praying people? How were our Muslim ancestors performing their Salaat-ul Eed? Did not they perform it in an open place nearby their town, even though it might have been on a rainy or chilly day, which was the practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him). However, let us assume that the matter is neither due to laziness nor disorganisation, nor due to the fact that they are accustomed to performing Salaat in enclosed places and are not acclimated to performing it in open places. If all the aforementioned is true and the excuse is a valid one, the solution, as Shaikh Abdul-Azeez Ibn Baaz states, is to have numerous places where the Salaat can be performed, not through holding many congregations [at the same place]. This is because if they were to hold a second [or more] Salaat-ul Eed then it would count as if one is performing a missed Salaat, not as performing a Salaat at its due time, even though the Imaam would be changed and the congregation is a different one. Our Shaikh, may Allaah benefit us with his knowledge, also stated that in the absence of large enough mosques, one may even resort to the use of houses in different areas to hold Salaat-ul Eed in congregation, and only Allaah, taaala, knows best.</answer>

The ruling is not strict, and the interests of the child are to be taken into account.

    <title>Extending the hair with a piece of cloth.</title>
    <question>The Prophet  (peace and blessings of
   Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah has cursed the one who makes hair extensions and
   the one who has this done. Does this include the pieces of cloth or ribbon which
   young girls put in their hair and which may be made in the shape of a rose or whatever for
   decoration, or the necklace of white ribbon which some of them wear? I have young
   daughters, and I am afraid of them falling into sin.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This hadeeth was reported by al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others. What it refers to is those who add hair extensions taken from the hair of other people, and the women who ask to have this done. The reason why this is forbidden is that it is false adornment which could be used to deceive or cheat others in matters of marriage and so on. As al-Bukhaari narrates from Muaawiyah, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) called this falsehood. If we understand the hadeeth and the wisdom behind this prohibition, we will see that it does not include the wearing of ribbons and flower-shaped decorations by young girls. As long as wearing ribbons on the braids or necklaces made of white ribbon are not customs that belong exclusively to the kuffaar, there is nothing wrong with doing these things, because the principle is that everything is allowed unless it is expressly forbidden. But the girls who do these things should cover these decorations in front of people who are not their mahrams (blood relatives whom they are permanently forbidden to marry), if they are at the age where covering themselves is obligatory. But everything that is done exclusively by the kuffaar is haraam, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade us to imitate or resemble them.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There is proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wiped his head and ears when performing wudoo. Ibn Abbaas reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wiped his head and his ears, inside and out. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who classed it as saheeh). Al-Nisaa'i reports that he wiped his head and his ears, wiping the inside of them with his index-finger and the outside of them with his thumb. (Classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah). Abu Dawood and al-Tahhaawi report from Miqdaad ibn Madi Karb that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he performed wudoo, wiped his head and his ears, inside and out, inserting his finger into the ear canal. (Reported by Abu Dawood; al-Haafiz ibn Hijr said: Its isnaad is hasan.) There is no dispute that one should wipe the ears during wudoo; the dispute is as to whether they are considered to be part of the head or not, and whether it is sunnah or waajib (obligatory) to wipe them.</answer>

    <title>Differing from the mushrikeen with regard to the beard</title>
    <question>I know that we are supposed to let
 our beards grow in order to be different from the mushrikeen, but nowadays they let their
 beards grow too. What is your opinion?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is waajib (obligatory) to let the beard grow, and shaving it is haraam (forbidden). Imaam Ahmad, al-Bukhaari, Muslim and others narrated from Ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Be different from the mushrikeen: let your beards grow and trim your moutsaches. Ahmad and Muslim reported from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Cut your moustaches and let your beards grow: be different from the Magians. Persisting in shaving ones beard is a major sin (kabeerah); the one who does this should be advised against it, and his action should be denounced, especially if he is in a position of religious leadership. The idea of being different from the Magians and other mushrikeen does not mean being different from them in every single thing, particularly if they happen to be doing something righteous or good in accordance with the fitrah (natural inclinations of man). What is meant is that we should be different from them in matters where they have gone astray and deviated from the truth and the dictates of the fitrah, and gone against the way of the Prophets and Messengers by shaving their beards. We should differ from them in this case by letting our beards grow and cutting our moustaches, following the guidance of the Prophets and Messengers, and in accordance with the fitrah. It is proven that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Ten things are part of the fitrah: cutting the moustache, letting the beard grow, cleaning the teeth with a siwaak, rinsing the nose with water, cutting ones nails, washing between the finger-joints, plucking the armpit hairs, shaving the pubic hair and cleaning ones private parts with water. (Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and the four authors of Sunan, from the hadeeth of Aaishah, may Allaah be pleased with her). Even if the kaafiroon start letting their beards grow, this does not mean that the Muslims are allowed to shave theirs, because as we have stated above, the idea is not to be different from them in everything, only in the things in which they have deviated from the truth and from the fitrah.</answer>

    <title>Women wearing wigs</title>
    <question>What is the ruling about women wearing
   wigs to appear attractive to their husbands?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Both husband and wife should make themselves attractive to one another, in ways that the other likes, so as to strengthen their relationship, but this has to be within the limits of what is allowed in shareeah, not by doing things that are prohibited. The use of wigs started among non-Muslim women, who were so well known for wearing them and adorning themselves with them that this became one of their distinguishing features. If a woman wears a wig and adorns herself with it, even if she does this for her husband, she is imitating the kaafir women, which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. Wigs also come under the ruling about hair extensions, which is even more vehement in its prohibition: the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade this practice and cursed the one who does it. Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 5/191. Humayd ibn Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Awf reported that he heard Muaawiyah ibn Abi Sufyaan at the time of Hajj, standing on the minbar and holding a piece of hair that had been seized by his guards, saying: Where are your scholars? I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbidding this kind of thing and saying that Bani Israaeel were destroyed when their women started to use such things. Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah has cursed the woman who adds false hair and the woman who has this done, and the woman who tattoos and the women who has this done. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 5477). And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Women cutting their hair</title>
    <question>What is the ruling about the haircut
   favoured by some women, whereby they cut the hair across their foreheads
   (bangs or fringe) and allow some locks or strands of hair to hang
   forward?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If the purpose of this haircut is to resemble kaafir and atheist women, then it is haraam, because imitation of non-Muslims is haraam, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. If the aim is not to imitate the non-Muslims, and it is only a modern trend among women that is considered attractive, then a woman can adorn herself in this way for her husband and appear like this in front of her close friends so that she may look and feel good among them. We do not see anything wrong with this.</answer>

    <question>Some men have hair growing on their
   cheeks. Is it permitted to shave it or not?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The hair on the cheeks is included in the ruling on the beard.

Among those who have stated that the hair on the cheeks is part of the beard are the authors of al-Qaamoos and al-Lisaan [famous Arabic dictionaries].</answer>

    <title>Curing Insinuating Whispers in Purification</title>
    <question>I am a young married woman and I have been suffering from the problem of waswas (insinuating thoughts from Shaytan) for quite some time. This waswas distracts me when I do wudu (ablution), to the extent that I cannot continue properly. It takes me an hour and a half each time I do wudu, because I think that I have not completed it. It is the same with ghusl (taking a bath) for janabah (impurity following marital relations)  it takes me hours, and I think that I have not cleaned myself or become pure (tahir). I have been in the hospital for psychological illnesses. What do you advise me to do?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Continue with your treatment in the hospital for psychological illnesses and with the doctors, in the hope that Allah may grant you healing. Seek the help of Allah and ask Him to cure you of your illness. Recite Ayat al-Kursi when you lie down to sleep. Say: Bismillahi-lladhi la yadurru maa ismihi shay un fil-ardi wa laa fis-sama wa huwa as-Samee al-Aleem (In the Name of Allah, with (the mention of) Whose Name nothing on earth or in heaven can do any harm, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing) three times in the morning and three times in the evening. Treat yourself with ruqya (sharee incantations) by reciting Soorat al-Ikhlas and al-Muawwadhatayn [the last two soorahs of the Quran] three times, blowing into your hands each time and wiping your hands over as much of your body as you can, before you go to sleep, because of the hadeeth (prophetic tradition) narrated by al-Bukhari in his Saheeh and by other scholars of hadeeth, from Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her). She said: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went to bed each night, he would put his hands together and blow in them and recite in them Qul huwa Allahu ahad (Say: He is Allah, (the) One), Qul aoodhu bi Rabbil-Falaq (Say: I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of the daybreak) and Qul aoodhu bi Rabbin-nas (Say: I seek refuge with (Allah) the Lord of mankind) [i.e., the last three soorahs of the Quran], then he would wipe with his hands whatever he could of his body, starting with his head and face, and the front part of his body, doing that three times. Pray to Allah to rid you of what you are suffering from, and say: Adh-hab al-bas Rabb an-nas washfi antash-Shafee la shifa a illa shifa uka shifa an la yughadiru saqaman (Remove the suffering, Lord of mankind, and heal me, for You are the Healer. There is no healing except Your healing, the healing which does not leave any illness behind), repeating that three times. Also recite the dua (supplication) for one in distress: La ilaha ill-Allah ul-Azeem ul-Haleem, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb ul-arsh il-adheem, la ilaha ill-Allah Rabb us-samawati wa Rabb ul-ardi wa Rabb ul-arsh il-kareem (There is no god but Allah, the Almighty, the Patient. There is no god but Allah, Lord of the magnificent Throne. There is no god but Allah, Lord of the heavens, Lord of the earth, and Lord of the noble Throne). When you have finished your wudu or ghusl/bath (for the end of menstruation or for janabah (impurity following marital relations)), then assume that you are now clean and pure, and ignore the waswas. Do not stay for too long in the bathroom because this is from Shaytan. In this way the waswas will stop, with the permission of Allah.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Shaving the beard is haraam, and it is not permissible to do it for a parent or leader or boss, because obedience is only a duty in matters that are good and righteous.

    <question>Will the prayer of one who leaves his
   pubic hair and does not shave it for a month be accepted?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Shaving the pubic hair  the hair that grows around the private parts  is part of the sunan al-fitrah (actions that befit the natural state of man). They should not be left without shaving for more than forty days because of the proven hadeeth to that effect. However, leaving them for more than forty days does not have any effect on the validity of a persons prayer, and to say that it does reflects ignorance of the pure shareeah.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There is no proof that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said any dua during wudu whilst washing or wiping his limbs, etc. Any such duas that are known are bidah (innovation) and have no basis. What is known from Islamic sources is that one should say Bismillah il-Rahman il-Raheem at the beginning, and after finishing one should recite the Shahadatayn (testimony of faith) and say, Allahumma ajalni min al-tawwabeen wajalni min al-mutatahhireen (O Allah, make me one of those who repent and make me one of those who purify themselves).

    <question>Does a woman have to shave her pubic hair after every period?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Removing the pubic hair, whether by plucking, using a depilatory agent, shaving or cutting, is one of the actions dictated by the fitrah and encouraged by Islam, but it is not restricted to or required at the end of every period. Ahmad, al-Bukhaari, Muslim and the authors of Sunan reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Five things are part of the fitrah: removing the pubic hairs, circumcision, trimming the moustache, plucking the armpit hairs, and trimming the nails. It was reported that Anas (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: A time limit was set for us with regard to trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, plucking the armpit hairs, and shaving the pubic hair  we should not leave it for more than forty days. (Reported by Muslim, Ibn Maajah, Ahmad, al-Tirmidhi, al-Nisaai and Abu Dawood). They said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) set a time limit for us</answer>

    <title>Ruling on enforced isolation of those who have AIDS and on those who deliberately infect others</title>
    <question>We have recently seen the spread of AIDS, which has many repercussions on society. This raises a number of questions, such as whether the person who has AIDS should be forcibly isolated from people who do not have the disease. What is the ruling on a person who deliberately transmits the disease to others? Is the person who has this disease considered to be suffering a terminal illness, because this is a factor in matters of divorce and financial transactions?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Firstly: isolation of the sick. The medical information that is currently available states that the AIDS virus is not transmitted through living with a person or touching him; it is not airborne; it is not transmitted through insects or through sharing food, drink, swimming pools, seats, eating utensils, and whatever else has to do with the ordinary details of living together day by day. The disease is primarily transferred in one of the following ways: Sexual contact, of whatever kind. Transfusion of infected blood or blood products. Using infected needles, especially among those who use drugs; using infected razors. AIDS may be passed from an infected mother to her child during pregnancy or childbirth. On the basis of the above, it is not necessary to isolate infected people from their healthy colleagues if there is no fear of them passing on the disease. The patient may be dealt with according to regular medical procedures. Secondly: deliberately transmitting the disease. Deliberately passing on AIDS to a healthy person is the deliberate commission of a haraam (forbidden) deed, and is counted as a serious major sin. It requires a punishment in this world, to be determined in accordance with the level of the crime and its impact on individuals and society as a whole. If the intention was to spread this terrible disease in society, this is counted as a kind of aggression and spreading mischief on earth, which should be met with one of the punishments referred to in the aayah: The recompense of those who wage war against Allaah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter. [al-Maaidah 5:33] If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, and this is what happens, but the person who has been infected has not yet died, the person who did this should be punished with tazeer (a punishment to be determined by the qaadi or judge). If the infected person dies, then the matter of execution should be looked into. If his aim is to deliberately infect a specific person, but this does not happen, then he should be punished with tazeer. Thirdly: considering AIDS to be a terminal illness: In shareeah, AIDS is counted as a terminal illness once it is full-blown and the patient is no longer living a normal life and death is approaching.</answer>

    <title>Is It Haram to Shave Your Beard?</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on shaving the beard or removing part of it?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.Shaving the beard is haram because of the sahih ahadith that clearly state this, and because of the general application of texts that forbid resembling the unbelievers. Ibn Umar narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Be different from the polytheists; let your beards grow and trim your moustaches. According to another report: Trim your moustaches and let your beards grow . There are other hadith which convey the same meaning, which is to leave the beard as it is and let it grow long, without shaving, plucking or cutting any part of it. Ibn Hazm reported that there was scholarly consensus that it is an obligation to trim the moustache and let the beard grow . He quoted a number of ahadith as evidence, including the hadith of Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) quoted above, and the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever does not remove any of his moustache is not one of us. (Classed as sahih by al-Tirmidhi). Ibn Hazm said in al-Furu: This formula according to our colleagues [i.e., the Hanbalis] means that it is haram to shave the beard . Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The Quran, Sunnah and ijma (scholarly consensus) all indicate that we must differ from the unbelievers in all aspects and not imitate them, because imitating them on the outside will make us imitate them in their bad deeds and habits, and even in beliefs, which will result in befriending them in our hearts, just as loving them in our hearts will lead to imitating them on the outside. Al-Tirmidhi reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, He is not one of us who imitates people other than us. Do not imitate the Jews and Christians. According to another version: Whoever imitates a people is one of them.  (Reported by al-Imam Ahmad) Umar ibn al-Khattab rejected the testimony of the person who plucked his beard. Al-Imam Ibn Abd al-Barr said in al-Tamhid: It is forbidden to shave the beard, and no one does this except men who are effeminate i.e., those who imitate women. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had a thick beard (reported by Muslim from Jabir). It is not permitted to remove any part of the beard because of the general meaning of the texts which forbid doing so. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Is It Haram to Have Long Nails?</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on men or women letting their nails grow long? If it is forbidden, what is the wisdom behind this prohibition?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.Cutting the nails is part of the fitrah . Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The fitrah is five things: circumcision , removing the pubic hair, trimming the moustache, cutting the nails, and plucking the armpit hairs . (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim). According to another hadith, ten things are part of the fitrah, including cutting the nails. Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) set a time limit for us to cut our moustaches, cut our nails, pluck our armpit hairs and shave our pubic hairs: we were not to leave it any longer than forty days. (Reported by Ahmad, Muslim and al-Nasai; this version narrated by Ahmad). Whoever does not cut his nails is going against the fitrah. The reason behind this is cleanliness and hygiene, because dirt can gather under the nails. It also serves the purpose of making us different from those among the non-Muslims who allow their nails to grow long, and from animals that have claws and talons. (Fatawa al-Lajnah al-Daimah, 5/173) Another bad habit that many people have is to leave one nail long. All of this is clearly contrary to the ways of the fitrah. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. Allah is the Guide to the Straight Path. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Is Muhammad peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) created from light? What is wrong with celebrating his birthday?</title>
    <question>In our locality there are people who hold
   celebrations of the birthday of the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
   him) every year. They think that the Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon
   him) is not like the rest of mankind, but that he is light from the Light of Allaah
   Himself, that he is present and watching in every place, and that he himself attends every
   gathering held to celebrate his birthday, he hears what the people say about him, and he
   is there with them. For that reason they stand up and say in unison: Yaa
   Nabi-Allaah, yaa Rasool-Allaah, yaa Habeeb-Allaah, salaam alayka (O Prophet of
   Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, O Beloved of Allaah, peace be upon you). They call
   out to him as if he were present and ask for his help and support. What is the Islamic
   ruling on this? Is it correct or not? Is it sunnah, bidah, or what?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger and his family and companions. Celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is an innovation (bidah) which goes against the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and of the Rightly Guided Khaleefahs (al-khulafaa al-raashidoon) and the Sahaabah, may Allaah be pleased with them. It is proven that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever does anything that is not part of this matter of ours (i.e., Islam), will have it rejected. (For more details, please see Question # 249). Believing that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is not like the rest of humanity, and that he is light from the Light of Allaah Himself is not a correct belief, because it contradicts the Quraan. Allaah has stated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is human, and has explained what makes the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) different from the rest of mankind. He said (interpretation of the meaning): Say (O Muhammad): I am only a man like you. It has been inspired to me that your God is One God (Allaah). So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord. [al-Kahf 18:110] Mankind, human beings, are created, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him He created his wife (Hawwa/Eve), and from them both He created many men and women [al-Nisaa 4:1] O mankind, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily! We have created you from dust, then from a nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge) [al-Hajj 22:5] O Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as witness, and a bearer of glad tidings, and a warner, - and as one who invites to Allaah by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light. [al-Ahzaab 33:45-46] In contrast, Allaah is the First, and He has no beginning, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him), and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing. [al-Hadeed 57:3] Allaah called His Prophet light and a lamp spreading light because of the guidance and light with which Allaah sent him, with which Allaah guides all those who answer his call (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), as He says (interpretation of the meaning):  Indeed, there has come to you a light (Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) and a plain Book (this Quraan). [al-Maaidah 5:15] Saying that he is present and watching in every place, that he is himself present at every gathering to celebrate his birthday, and that he hears what the people present are saying, is all false. There is no basis for this in either the Quraan or the Sunnah. Calling on him and seeking his help and support is a form of major shirk which is not permitted, whether one is calling on the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or on any other created being, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  so invoke not anyone along with Allaah. [al-Junn 72:18] And whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allaah, any other god of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al-kaafiroon (the disbelievers) will not be successful. [al-Muminoon 23:117] (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 3/4) The Muslim should follow, not innovate. He should believe in Allaah alone, call on Him alone and seek His help alone. He should not call on or seek the help of anyone else. The consequences of shirk are devastating, as it will wipe out all a persons good deeds and lead to his doom in Hell. Bidah is a serious matter, which will cause a persons deeds to be thrown back at him, not accepted. The Muslim should love, respect, honour and obey the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and give his words precedence over the words of any other human being, but it is not permitted to exaggerate about him, or to raise his status above that which has been bestowed upon him by Allaah, or to call on him instead of Allaah, because this is a violation of the rights of Allaah, and involves directing acts of worship to someone other than Allaah, when they should only be directed towards Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted. We ask Allaah to help us to do that which will please Him and to avoid that which will earn His wrath, and to help us to love Him and His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <question>It happens that after I have cleaned myself (after passing water) and done wudoo, I feel some drops of urine come out, which makes me repeat my wudoo, sometimes twice. After the urine has come out, I wait for five minutes until I am sure that it has stopped, but after I finish wudoo, I feel
that a few small drops of urine have come out of me. I am trying to solve this problem so that I will have no doubts at all.

Sometimes I start washing my trousers because I am not sure whether there are any drops of urine on them.</question>

But if there is some doubt, you do not have to do that. You should not pay attention to doubts, lest you fall prey to waswaas (insinuating thoughts from Shaytaan).</answer>

    <title>Evidence Prohibiting of Mixing of Men and Women</title>
    <question>My husband and I wanted to know if it were permissable to take Arabic classes at a college where the classes are mixed (men-women). We understand that there is no mixing between the sexes, but confused about the definition of &quot;mixing&quot;. Please tell us what is permissable, what is not and give proof</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The meeting together, mixing, and intermingling of men and women in one place, the crowding of them together, and the revealing and exposure of women to men are prohibited by the Law of Islam (Shari'ah). These acts are prohibited because they are among the causes for fitnah (temptation or trial which implies evil consequences), the arousing of desires, and the committing of indecency and wrongdoing. Among the many proofs of prohibition of the meeting and mixing of men and women in the Quraan and Sunnah are: Verse No. 53 of Surat al-Ahzab, or the Confederates (Interpretation of the meaning); &quot;...for anything ye want, ask them from before a screen: that makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs...&quot; In explaining this Verse, Ibn Kathir (May Allaah have mercy on him) said: &quot;Meaning, as I forbade you to enter their rooms, I forbid you to look at them at all. If one wants to take something from them, one should do so without looking at them. If one wants to ask a woman for something, the same has to be done from behind a screen.&quot; The Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) enforced separation of men and women even at Allaahs most revered and preferred place, the mosque. This was accomplished via the separation of the womens rows from the mens; men were asked to stay in the mosque after completion of the obligatory prayer so that women will have enough time to leave the mosque; and, a special door was assigned to women. Evidence of the foregoing are: Umm Salamah (May Allah be pleased with her) said that after Allahs Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) said &quot;as-Salamu Alaykum wa Rahmatullah twice announcing the end of prayer, women would stand up and leave. He would stay for a while before leaving. Ibn Shihab said that he thought that the staying of the Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) was in order for the women to be able to leave before the men who wanted to depart.&quot; Narrated by al-Bukhari under No. 793. Abu Dawood under No. 876 narrates the same hadith in Kitab al-Salaat under the title &quot;Insiraaf an-Nisaa Qabl al-Rijaal min al-Salaah&quot; (Departure of Women before Men after the Prayer). Ibn Umar said that Allahs Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;We should leave this door (of the mosque) for women.&quot; Naafi said: &quot;Ibn Umar never again entered through that door until he died.&quot; Narrated by Abu Dawood under No. 484 in &quot;Kitab as-Salah&quot; under the Chapter entitled: &quot;at-Tashdid fi Thalik&quot;. Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet (May peace and blessings be upon him) said: &quot;&quot;The best of the mens rows is the first and the worst is the last, and the best of the womens rows is the last and the worst in the first.&quot; Narrated by Muslim under No. 664. This is the greatest evidence that the Law of Islam (Shari'ah) forbids meeting and mixing of men and women. The farther the men are from the womens rows, the better, and vice versa. If these procedures and precautions were prescribed and adhered to in a mosque, which is a pure place of worship where people are as far away as they ever are from the arousal of desire and temptation, then no doubt the same procedures need to be followed even more rigorously at other places. Abu Usayd al-Ansari narrated that he heard Allahs Messenger (May peace and blessings be upon him) say to the women on his way out of the mosque when he saw men and women mixing together on their way home: Give way (i.e., walk to the sides) as it is not appropriate for you to walk in the middle the road. Thereafter, women would walk so close to the wall that their dresses would get caught on it. Narrated by Abu Dawood in &quot;Kitab al-Adab min Sunanihi, Chapter: Mashyu an-Nisa Ma ar-Rijal fi at-Tariq.&quot;We know that the intermingling, mixing and crowding together of men and women is part of todays unavoidable yet regrettable affliction in most places, such as markets, hospitals, colleges, etc., but:  We will not willfully choose or accept mixing and crowding, particularly in religious classes and council meetings in Islamic Centers.  We take precautions to avoid meeting and mixing of men and women as much as possible while at the same time achieving desired goals and objectives. This result can be achieved by designating separate places assigned for men and women, using different doors for each, utilizing modern means of communication such as microphones, video recorders etc., and expediting efforts to have enough female teachers to teach women, etc.  We show fear of Allaah as much as we can by not looking at members of the opposite sex and by applying self-restraint. There follow some of the results of a study on mixing undertaken by some Muslim social science researchers. When we put the following question: What is the Islamic ruling on mixing as far as you know? The results were as follows: 76% of respondents said It is not permitted. 12% said, It is permitted  but moral, religious, etc. restrictions apply 12% said, I dont know. Which would you choose? If you had the choice between working in a mixed workplace and working in another where there was no mixing, which would you choose? The responses to this question were as follows: 76% would choose the workplace where there was no mixing. 9% preferred the mixed workplace. 15% would accept any workplace which suited their specialties, regardless of whether it was mixed or not. Very embarrassing Have any embarrassing situations ever happened to you because of mixing? Among the embarrassing moments mentioned by respondents in this study were the following: I was at work one day, and I went into one department where one of my female colleagues who wears hijaab had taken off her hijaab in front of her female colleagues. My entrance took her by surprise and I was very embarrassed as a result. I had to do an experiment in the lab at university, but I was absent on the day of the experiment. I had to go to the lab on the following day, and I found myself the only male among a group of female students, in addition to a female teacher and a female lab technician. I was very embarrassed and felt very awkward with all those female eyes glaring at me. I was trying to take a feminine towel out of one of the drawers when I was surprised by a male colleague standing behind me, who wanted to take something from his own private drawer. He noticed that I was embarrassed and he left the room quickly to avoid my embarrassment. It so happened that one of the girls at the university bumped into me when turning a corner in a crowded corridor. She was walking quickly, going to one of the lectures. As a result of this collision, she lost her balance, and I caught her in my arms, as if I was embracing her. You can imagine how embarrassed I and this girl felt in front of a group of careless young people. One of my female colleagues fell on the stairs in the university and her clothes fell open in an extremely embarrassing fashion. She landed upside down and could not help herself; the young men standing nearby had no option but to cover her and help her to get up. I work in a company and I went in to give some papers to my boss. When I was going out, my boss called me back. I turned around and saw him with his face turned away. I was waiting for him to ask me for a file or for more papers, and I was surprised by his hesitancy. I turned away to the left side of his office, pretending to be busy with something, and he spoke to me at the same time. I thought that this boss would say anything except what he actually said, which was to point out that my garment was stained with menstrual blood. Can the earth open up and swallow a human being at the moment of making sincere supplication? For I prayed that the earth would open up and swallow me. Victims of mixing True stories Lost hope Umm Muhammad, a mature woman over the age of 40, tells her story. I lived a life of modest means with my husband. There was never any closeness and harmony, and my husband did not have the kind of strong personality that a woman would hope for, but his good nature made me overlook the fact that I was the one who was responsible for most of the decision making in the family. My husband often used to mention the name of his friend and business partner, and he would talk about him in my presence, and I often used to meet with him in his office which was originally part of our apartment. This went on for many years, until circumstances led to us exchanging visits with this person and his family. These family visits were repeated and because of his close friendship with my husband, we did not notice how the number of visits increased and how many hours a single visit would last. He often used to come on his own to sit with us, me and my husband, for long visits. My husbands trust in him knew no bounds, and as days passed I got to know this person very well, and saw how wonderful and decent he was. I began to feel a strong attraction towards this man, and at the same time I began to sense that the feeling was mutual. Things took a strange turn after that, when I realized that this man was the kind of person I had always dreamed about. Why had he come along now, after all these years? The more this mans status increased in my eyes, the more my husbands status diminished. It was as if I had needed to see the beauty of his character in order to discover how ugly my husbands character was. The matter between this person and myself did not go beyond these persistent thoughts which were occupying my mind night and day. Neither he nor I ever voiced what we felt in our hearts until today. Yet despite that my life is over and my husband is little more than a weak man with no self-esteem. I hate him and I do not know how all this hatred towards him started to boil over. I wonder how I put up with him all these years, bearing all these burdens by myself, facing lifes problems on my own. Things got so bad that I asked him for a divorce, and he divorced me at my request. After that he became a broken man. Even worse than that is that after my marriage was wrecked and my children and husband were devastated, problems arose in this man's family. His wife, with her feminine intuition, realized what had been going on in his heart of hearts, and his life became hell. She was overwhelmed with jealousy to the extent that one night she left her house at 2 a.m. and came to attack my house, screaming, weeping and hurling accusations. His marriage was also about to collapse. I admit that the lovely gatherings which we used to enjoy gave us the opportunity to get to know one another at a time that was not appropriate at this stage in our lives. His marriage has been wrecked and so has mine. I have lost everything, and now I know that my circumstances and his will not permit us to take any positive step towards coming together. Now I am more miserable than I have ever been, and I am looking for illusionary happiness and lost hopes. Tit-for-tat Umm Ahmad tells us: My husband had a group of married friends, and because of our close friendship with them, we used to get together with them once a week in one of our houses, to enjoy an evening of chat. Deep down in my heart I was never really comfortable with the atmosphere in which we would have dinner, sweets, snacks and drinks of juice accompanied by waves of laughter because of the jokes and chit-chats that often went beyond the bounds of good manners. In the name of friendship, the barriers were lifted and every now and then one would hear suppressed laughter between a woman and the husband of another woman. The jokes were too much, dealing  with no sense of shyness with sensitive topics such as sex and womens private matters. This was usual and was even accepted and regarded as desirable. Although I indulged in these things along with them, my conscience made me feel guilty. Then the day came when it became quite clear just how ugly and filthy this atmosphere was. The telephone rang, and I heard the voice of one of the friends in this group. I said hello to him and apologized that my husband was not home. He replied that he knew that, and that he was calling to speak to me! After he suggested starting a relationship with me, I got very angry and spoke harshly to him and cursed him. All he could do was laugh and say, Dont try and show these good manners to me; go and check on your husbands good manners and see what he is doing I was devastated by what he said, but I pulled myself together and said to myself, this person is only trying to cause the break up of your marriage. But he succeeded in planting the seeds of doubt concerning my husband. Shortly after that, the major disaster struck. I discovered that my husband was cheating on me with another woman. It was the matter of life or death as far as I was concerned. I found my husband out and I confronted him, saying: You are not the only one who can have a relationship. I have received a similar proposition. And I told him all about his friend. He was stunned and absolutely shocked. (I said:) If you want me to respond in kind to your relationship with that woman, then this is for that, tit-for-tat. This was a huge slap in the face for him. He knew that I did not intend to do that in reality, but he realized the great disaster that had befallen our lives and the immoral atmosphere in which we were living. I suffered a great deal until my husband finally left that loose woman with whom he was having a relationship, as he admitted to me. Yes, he left her and came back to his family and children, but how can I ever feel the same towards him as I used to? Who will restore respect for him in my heart? This huge wound in my heart is still bleeding out of regret and rage at that filthy atmosphere; it still bears testimony to the fact that what they call innocent get-togethers are in reality anything but innocent. My heart still begs for mercy from the Lord of Glory. Intelligence can also be a temptation (fitnah) Abd al-Fattaah says: I work as the head of department in one of the big companies. For a long time I admired one of my female colleagues, not for her beauty, but for her serious attitude towards her work, her intelligence and her excellent achievements  in addition to the fact that she was a decent and modest person who focused only on her work. This admiration turned into attachment, and I am a married man who fears Allaah and never misses any obligatory prayer. I expressed my feelings to her and she rebuffed me. She is married and has children as well. She sees no reason why I should have any kind of relationship with her, whether it be friendship, as work colleagues or based on admiration etc. Evil thoughts come to me sometimes, and deep down I wish that her husband would divorce her so that I could get her. I started to put pressure on her at work and put her down in front of my bosses. Perhaps this was a form of revenge on my part, but she accepted it with good manners and did not complain or comment. She works and works; her performance speaks of her quality, and she knows this well. The more she resisted me, the stronger my infatuation grew. I am not a person who is easily tempted by women, because I fear Allaah and I do not overstep the mark with them and go beyond what is required by my work. But this woman attracted me. What is the solution? I do not know. Baby ducks know how to swim N.A.A., a nineteen-year-old girl, tells us: At that time I was a little girl. My innocent eyes watched those evening get-togethers when family friends would meet in the house. What I remember is that I could only see one man, who was my father. I watched him as he moved about the room, how his glances would devour the women present, looking at their thighs and chests, admiring this ones eyes, that ones hair, the others hips. My poor mother had no choice but to take care of these get-togethers. She was a very simple lady. Among the women present there was one woman who would deliberately try to attract my fathers attention, sometimes by coming close to him, and sometimes by making enticing movements. I would watch this with concern, whilst my mother was busy in the kitchen for the sake of her guests. These gatherings stopped suddenly and I tried, young as I was, to understand and make sense of what had happened, but I could not. What I remember was that my mother collapsed completely at that time, and she could not stand to hear my fathers name mentioned in the house. I used to hear mysterious words whispered by the adults around me: Betrayal bedroom she saw them with her own eyes despicable woman in a very shameful position etc. These were the key words which only the adults could understand. I grew up and came to understand, and I bore a grudge against all men. All of them were treacherous. My mother was a broken woman and accused every woman who came to us of being a man-snatcher who wanted to make my father fall into her trap. My father hasnt changed. He is still practising his favourite hobby of chasing women, but now he does it outside the home. Now I am nineteen years old and I know lots of young men. I feel great pleasure in taking revenge on them, because every one of them is an exact copy of my father. I tempt them and entice them, without letting them get anywhere near me. They follow me in gatherings and in the marketplaces because of my movements and deliberate gestures. Sometimes my phone never stops ringing and I feel proud of what I do to avenge the sex of Hawwa and my mother. But sometimes I feel so miserable and such a failure that it almost chokes me. My life is shadowed by a huge dark cloud, and its name is my father. Before it is too late S.N.A. tells of her experience: I never imagined that my work circumstances would force me to be in contact with the opposite sex (men), but this in fact is what happened In the beginning, I used to cover and screen myself from men by wearing niqaab (face-veil), but some of the sisters advised me that this dress was attracting more attention to my presence, and it would be better for me to take off the niqaab, especially since my eyes were somewhat attractive. So I removed the cover from my face, thinking that this was better. But by continuing to mix with my colleagues, I discovered that I was the odd one out because of my antisocial attitude and my insistence on not joining in the conversation and chatting with others. Everyone was wary of this lone-wolf woman (as they saw me), and this is what was stated clearly by one person who affirmed that he would not want to deal with such a snooty and stand-offish character. But I knew that I was the opposite, in fact, and I decided that I would not oppress myself and put myself in a difficult position with my colleagues. So I started to join in their chats and exchanges of anecdotes, and they all discovered that I could speak eloquently and persuasively, and that I could influence others. I could also speak in a manner that was determined yet at the same time was attractive to some of my colleagues. It was not long before I noticed some changes in the expression of my direct supervisor; with some embarrassment, he was enjoying the way I spoke and moved, and he would deliberately bring up topics in the conversation where I would see that hateful look in his eyes. I do not deny the fact that I started to entertain some thoughts about this man. I found it astonishing that a man could fall so easily into the trap of a woman who was religiously committed, so how must it be in the case of women who adorn themselves and invite men to commit immoral actions? In fact, I did not think of him in any way which went beyond the bounds of shareeah, but he did occupy a space in my thoughts for quite some time. But soon my self-respect made me reject the idea of being a source of enjoyment for this man in any way, shape or form, even if it was only psychological in nature, and I stopped getting involved in any kind of work that would force me to sit alone with him. In the end, I reached the following conclusions: 1- Attraction between the sexes can occur in any circumstances, no matter how much men and women may deny that. The attraction may start within the bounds of shareeah and end up going beyond those bounds. Even if a person protects himself (by marriage), he is not safe from the snares of the Shaytaan. 3- Even though a person may be able to guarantee himself and he works with the opposite sex within reasonable limits, he cannot guarantee the feelings of the other party. Finally, there is nothing good in mixing and it does not bear fruit as they claim. On the contrary, it corrupts sound thinking. What now? We may ask, what comes next, after this discussion on the matter of mixing? Its about time for us to recognize that no matter how we try to beautify the issue of mixing and take the matter lightly, its consequences are bound to catch up with us, and the harm it causes will have disastrous results for our families. Sound common sense refuses to accept that mixing is a healthy atmosphere for human relations. This is the sound common sense which made most of the people included in this survey (76%) prefer working in a non-mixed environment. The same percentage (76%) said that mixing is not permitted according to the shareeah. What makes us sit up and take notice is not this honourable percentage  which indicates the purity of our Islamic society and the cleanness of its members hearts  but the small number who said that mixing is permitted; they number 12%. This group, with no exceptions, said that mixing is permitted but within the limits set by religion, custom (urf), traditions, good manners, conscience, modesty, covering and other worthy values which, in their opinion, keep mixing within proper limits. We ask them: is the mixing which we see nowadays in our universities, market-places, work-places and family and social gatherings, taking place within the limits referred to above? Or are these places filled with transgressions in terms of clothing, speech, interactions and behaviour? We see wanton displays of adornment (tabarruj), not proper covering; we see fitnah (temptations) and dubious relationships, with no good manners and no conscience and no covering. We can conclude that the kind of mixing that is happening nowadays is unacceptable even to those who approve of mixing in a clean atmosphere. Its about time for us to recognize that mixing provides a fertile breeding-ground for social poisons to invade and take over our society without anyone ever realizing that it is mixing which is the cause. Mixing is the prime element in this silent fitnah, in the shade of which betrayals erupt, homes are wrecked and hearts are broken. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound, and to reform our society. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Taking an orphans property is stealing</title>
    <question>I made a vow and I have orphans under my care. Can I fulfil this vow from the property of these orphans?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible to fulfil the vow from the property of the orphans. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And come not near to the orphans property, except to improve it [al-Anaam 6:152] If we pay this from the orphans property, there is no benefit to the orphan, rather taking it is counted as stealing. Everyone who is in charge of orphans property has to dispose of it in the manner which he thinks is in the orphans best interests. With regard to that which is not in their interests, or which serves some interest but there is some doubt as to whether it is in their best interests, then it is not permissible to dispose of it in that manner, because of the quotation mentioned (interpretation of the meaning): And come not near to the orphans property, except to improve it [al-Anaam 6:152] So it is not permissible dispose of it, even if they are her children.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.; Reply for this question would be the same as the reply to question #23325. In addition, the following should be noted: We should differentiate between good treatment of non-Muslims and befriending them. We should differentiate between establishing a relationship with a non-Muslim for the purpose of dawah (i.e. teaching him and inviting him to Islam) and befriending him for no valid Islamic purpose. We should differentiate between establishing a relationship with a non-Muslim for trading and/or education reasons and befriending him, as friendship would mean deeper feeling of affection and fondness, comradeship, and being influenced by him.</answer>

    <title>Sighting the moon not following astronomical calculations</title>
    <question>There is a big dispute among Muslim scholars concerning the timing of the beginning of Ramadaan and Eid al-Fitr. Some of them act upon the sighting of the new moon, because of the hadeeth, Fast when you sight it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you sight it; others rely on the calculations of astronomers, saying that these scientists have progressed so far in the science of astronomy that they are able to know when the lunar month begins. Who is right in this matter?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the correct opinion which must be acted upon is that indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days. That is the basis for determining the beginning and end of Ramadaan by the actual sighting of the new moon. The Islamic shareeah with which Allaah sent our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is universal and everlasting, until the Day of Resurrection. (It is valid for every time and place, whether worldly sciences are advanced or otherwise, whether there are telescopes etc. or not, whether there are any people in the population who are able to do astronomical calculations or not. Sighting the moon is something that people of all places and times can do, unlike calculations which may or may not be within the reach of the people, and telescopes which may or may not be available) Secondly: Allaah knew what progress would be made in astronomy and other sciences, but despite that He still said (interpretation of the meaning):  So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month [al-Baqarah 2:185] and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it So the beginning and ending of Ramadaan are connected to the actual sighting of the moon, and not to the calculations of astronomers, even though Allaah knew that the astronomers would develop their science to the point where they would be able to calculate the positions of the stars and heavenly bodies. The Muslims are obliged to follow what Allaah has prescribed for them through His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), basing the beginning and end of the fast on the sighting of the moon. This is like the consensus of the scholars, whoever differs with this and relies on calculations is shaadhdh (odd) and his opinion cannot be relied on. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This extra fee that you are charging for late payments from the purchaser is the essence of ribaa. Hence when Allaah stated that the ribaa which the people of the Jaahiliyyah used to charge when the debtor delayed payment, when they would charge the debtor more in return for a respite, was forbidden, He commanded that the debtor should be given a respite without further charges being made. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning): And if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay; but if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know [al-Baqarah 2:280] And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>The wisdom behind the creation of dangerous animals</title>
    <question>What is The wisdom behind the creation of dangerous animals ?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There are two aspects to the answer to this question: general and specific. The general answer is that the Muslim believes that Allaah is All-Wise and All-Knowing, and He does not create anything in vain; all of His actions are based on Wisdom. If the wisdom behind any of His actions is hidden from the believer, then he should still adhere to this principle, and not think of his Lord in bad terms. The specific answer is that the wisdom behind the creation of these things is to manifest the perfect nature of Allaahs creation and control of all things. Even though the created things are so many, He provides for them all. He also tests people by means of these (dangerous creatures), rewards those who are afflicted by them and makes manifest the bravery of those who kill them. By creating them, He tests His slaves faith and certainty: the believer accepts the matter and submits, whilst the doubter says, What is the point of Allaah creating this?! He also demonstrates the weakness and incapability of man, whereby he suffers pain and sickness because of a creature which is far smaller than he is. One of the scholars was asked about the wisdom behind the creation of flies. He said, so that Allaah may humiliate the noses of the tyrants with them. Because of the existence of harmful creatures, it becomes apparent how great is the blessing in the creation of beneficial things, as it is said that contrast with the opposite demonstrates the nature of things. The study of medicine has demonstrated that many beneficial drugs are derived from the venom of snakes and the like. Glory be to the One Who has created benefits in things that to all outward appearances are harmful. Moreover, many of these dangerous animals are food for other creatures which are beneficial, and this forms the ecological cycle in the environments where Allaah has created them. But the Muslim has to believe that everything that Allaah does is good, and that there is no pure evil in what He creates. In everything that He creates there has to be some aspect of good, even if it is hidden from us, as is the case with the creation of Iblees, who is the head of evil. But there is wisdom and a purpose behind his creation, for Allaah tests His creatures by means of him, to distinguish the obedient from the disobedient, those who strive from those who are negligent, the people of Paradise from the people of Hell. We ask Allaah to bless us with strength of faith and understanding of our religion. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and grant him peace.</answer>

    <title>The fate of kuffaar who did not hear the message of Islam</title>
    <question>Someone has asked me this question
   (she is about to    become a muslimah). Her statement: 'A
   lot of others will never meet a Muslim in person. Will they be held responsible for their
   ignorance? What exactly does this mean: &quot;After the revelation of the Quran who ever
   receives this message &amp; does not abide by it is a non-believer&quot;?    i. Who is considered to have received
   the message?    ii. Isn't it possible for people
   to have not received the message even though the Quran is in existence?'</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is part of the justice of Allaah that He does not punish any people until He has first sent a warning to them and unless there is evidence against them. Allaah does not treat anybody unfairly. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning). [al-Israa 17:15]. In his tafseer (commentary) on this aayah, Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: These words, And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning) tell us of the justice of Allaah, may He be exalted, and that He does not punish anyone until after He has established evidence against him by sending a Messenger to him. This is like the aayat (interpretation of the meaning): Every time a group is cast therein [into Hell], its keeper will ask, Did no warner come to you? They will say, Yes indeed; a warner did come to us, but we belied him and said: Allaah never sent down anything (of revelation), you are only in great error. [al-Mulk 67:8] and: And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups, till, when they reach it, the gates thereof will be opened (suddenly like a prison at the arrival of its prisoners). And its keepers will say, Did not the Messengers come to you from yourselves, - reciting to you the Verses of your Lord, and warning you of the Meeting of this Day of yours? They will say: Yes, but the Word of torment has been justified against the disbelievers! [al-Zumar 39:71] A person who has never heard of Islam or the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and who has never heard the message in its correct and true form, will not be punished by Allaah if he dies in a state of kufr (disbelief). If it were asked what his fate will be, the answer will be that Allaah will test him on the Day of Resurrection: if he obeys, he will enter Paradise and if he disobeys he will enter Hell. The evidence (daleel) for this is the hadeeth of al-Aswad ibn Saree, who reported that the Prophet of Allaah SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There are four (who will protest) to Allaah on the Day of Resurrection: the deaf man who never heard anything, the insane man, the very old man, and the man who died during the fatrah (the interval between the time of Eesaa (Jesus, upon whom be peace) and the time of Muhammad SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)). The deaf man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I never heard anything. The insane man will say, O Lord, Islam came but the children ran after me and threw stones at me. The very old man will say, O Lord, Islam came but I did not understand anything. The man who died during the fatrah will say, O Lord, no Messenger from You came to me. He will accept their promises of obedience, then word will be sent to them to enter the Fire. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, if they enter it, it will be cool and safe for them. According to another report, he said: Whoever enters it, it will be cool and safe for him, and whoever does not enter it will be dragged to it. (The hadeeth was reported by Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Hibbaan, and deemed saheeh by al-Albaani, Saheeh al-Jaami, 881). Everyone who hears the message of Islam in a sound and correct form (and rejects it), will have evidence aginst him. Whoever dies without having heard the message, or having heard it in a distorted form, then his case is in the hands of Allaah. Allaah knows best about His creation, and He will never treat anyone unfairly. And Allaah is All-Seer of His slaves.</answer>

    <title>It is permissible to use telescopes etc., but not calculations, to sight the new moon</title>
    <question>It is not possible to see the new moon with the naked eye before it is 30 hours old, and in addition to that, it is sometimes not possible to see it at all because of the weather conditions. On this basis, is it permissible to resort to using astronomical information to calculate the likely time for sighting the new moon and the start of Ramadaan, or do we have to actually sight the new moon before we start fasting the blessed month of Ramadaan?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to use telescopes etc. to sight the moon, but it is not permissible to rely on astronomical data to confirm the beginning or end of the blessed month of Ramadaan, because Allaah has not prescribed that for us in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). What He has prescribed for us is to confirm the beginning and end of Ramadaan by sighting the new moon of Ramadaan to start fasting, and the new moon of Shawwaal to end the fast and gather to offer the Eid prayers. Allaah has made the new moons to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the Hajj, so it is not permissible for Muslims to use any other method to determine the times for acts of worship such as fasting, celebrating Eid, performing Hajj, fasting for two months as expiation (kafaarah) for killing someone by mistake or divorcing ones wife by zihaar, and so on. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):  So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month [al-Baqarah 2:185] They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage [al-Baqarah 2:189] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days. On this basis, the one who does not see the new moon from the time it rises on a clear or cloudy night must complete the month (of Shabaan) with thirty days. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 10/100). This is the case if the sighting of the new moon is not confirmed in another country; if the moon is sighted according to the guidelines of Shareeah, then fasting is obligatory, according to the majority of scholars. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Do different times of moonrise matter, and what should Muslim communities in the West do</title>
    <question>Since the prophet said &quot;Begin fasting after sighting the moon&quot;, how can muslims be fasting one on Tuesday in one part of the world and wednesday in another part. We should all begin our fast at the same time regardless of where we live.
We are students in the U.S. and Canada, and we face the same problem every year at the beginning of Ramadaan, because the Muslims are split into three groups:A group that fasts when the new moon is sighted in the city in which they live.
A group that fasts when fasting starts in Saudi Arabia.
A group that fasts when they hear news from the Muslim students union in the U.S. and Canada which watches for the new moon in different parts of America, and as soon as the new moon is sighted in one city, they spread the news to different Islamic centres so that the Muslims in America can start fasting on the same day, despite the great distances between the different cities.
Which group should we follow? Whose sighting of the moon should we rely on? Please give us a fatwa, may Allaah reward you.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Firstly: the fact that the moon rises at different times in different places is a well-established fact; no scholar disputes this. However, the scholars differ as to whether this matters or not. Secondly: the question as to whether different times of moonrise is something that matters is a theoretical question in which ijtihaad is permissible. Those who have knowledge of science and religion differ on this matter, and this difference of opinion is permissible; the one who has the correct opinion will have two rewards, one for being right and one for making ijtihaad; the one whose opinion is wrong will still be rewarded for his ijtihaad. The scholars differences on this matter may be described as one of two: some of them thought that the differences in the times of the moons rising was of significance, and others thought that it was not. Both groups cite evidence from the Quraan and Sunnah, and maybe even quote the same text, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage [al-Baqarah 2:189] and the hadeeth, Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it The difference is one of interpretation of the texts, as each group has its own methods of deriving evidence. Thirdly: the committee has looked at the issue of confirming the new moon by calculations and what was said on this matter in the Quraan and Sunnah, and they have studied the opinions of the scholars on this matter. They decided unanimously that astronomical calculations do not count when it comes to confirming the new moon for shar'i purposes, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it and also: Do not fast until you see it [the new moon] and do not stop fasting until you see it, and because of the evidence that is derived from these ahaadeeth. The Standing Committee on Scientific Research and Fatwas (al-Lajnah al-Daaimah lil-Buhooth al-Ilmiyyah wal-Iftaa) thinks that the Muslim students union (or any other group representing the Muslim community) in countries where the government is not Islamic should take the place of an Islamic government in the matter of confirming the new moon for the people living in those non-Islamic countries. On the basis of the above, this union has the choice of two options: either to consider the differences in times of moonrise to be of significance, or not to do so. Then they should inform all the Muslims in their country what their opinion is, and the Muslims have to follow what they have been told, so as to unite the Muslims in their fasting and to put an end to disputes and confusion. Everyone who lives in those countries should try to sight the moon in the place where they are living, and if one or more trustworthy persons sight the moon, they should fast according to that and tell the union to spread the news. This is at the beginning of Ramadaan; at the end of the month there has to be two witnesses to see the new moon of Shawwaal or the completion of thirty days of Ramadaan, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days.

    <title>Is the Mahdi real or not?</title>
    <question>Is the hadith about the coming of Mehdi Saheeh?
Because I was told by a friend of mine, that it's not and it's a weak hadith.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. There are saheeh ahaadeeth that indicate that the Mahdi (peace be upon him) will appear at the end of time. He is one of the signs of the Hour. Among these ahaadeeth are the following: 1. Abu Saeed al-Khudri reported that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;At the end of the time of my ummah, the Mahdi will appear. Allaah will grant him rain, the earth will bring forth its fruits, he will give a lot of money, cattle will increase and the ummah will become great. He will rule for seven or eight years. (Mustadrak al-Haakim, 4/557-558; he said: this is a hadeeth whose isnaad is saheeh, although it was not reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. Al-Dhahabi agreed with him, and al-Albaani said: this is a saheeh sanad, and its men are thiqaat (trustworthy), Silsilat al-ahaadeeth al-saheehah, vol. 2, p. 336, hadeeth 771) 2. Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: The Mahdi is one of us, a member of my family. Allaah will guide him in a single night.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, 2/58, hadeeth 645, edited by Ahmad al-Shaakir, who said: its isnaad is saheeh; Sunan Ibn Maajah, 2/1367. This hadeeth was also classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami al-Sagheer, 6735). Ibn Katheer said: &quot;This means that Allaah will forgive him, grant him help, inspire him and guide him, when he was not like this before.&quot; (Al-Nihaayah, al-Fitan wal-Malaahim, 1/29; edited by Taha Zayni). 3. Abu Saeed al-Khudri said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: The Mahdi is of my lineage, with a high forehead and a long, thin, curved nose. He will fill the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled with oppression and injustice, and he will rule for seven years.&quot; (Sunan Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Mahdi, 11/375, hadeeth 4265; Mustadrak al-Haakim, 4/557; he said: this is a saheeh hadeeth according to the conditions of Muslim, although it was not reported by al-Bukhaari and Muslim. See also Saheeh al-Jaami, 6736). 4. Umm Salamah said: &quot;I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) say: The Mahdi is of my lineage and family, from the descendants of Faatimah.&quot; (Sunan Abu Dawud, 11/373; Sunan Ibn Maajah. 2/1368. Al-Albaani said that it is saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami, 6734) 5. Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: Eesaa ibn Maryam will descend, and their leader the Mahdi will say, &quot;Come and lead us in prayer,&quot; but he will say, &quot;No, one of them should lead them as an honour to this ummah from Allaah.&quot;&quot; The version narrated by Muslim says: &quot; Then Eesaa ibn Maryam (Peace be upon him) will descend and their leader will say, Come and lead us in prayer, but he will say, No, some of you are leaders over others as an honour from Allaah to this ummah.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, 225) 6. Abu Saeed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;He is one of us, behind whom Eesaa ibn Maryam will pray.&quot; (Reported by Abi Naeem in Akhbaar al-Mahdi. Al-Albaani said it is saheeh; see al-Jaami al-Sagheer, 5/219, hadeeth 5796). 7. Abdullaah ibn Masood reported that the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;The world will not come to an end until the Arabs are ruled by a man from my family whose name will be the same as mine.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, 5/199, hadeeth 3573. Another version says: &quot; whose name is the same as mine and whose fathers name is the same as my fathers.&quot; Sunan Abi Dawud, 11/370). The ahaadeeth concerning the appearance of the Mahdi reach the level of Tawaatur in meaning (tawaatur refers to a hadeeth which was narrated by so many people through so many isnaads that it is inconceivable that they could all have agreed on a lie). The imaams and scholars of this ummah have stated this, and a few of their comments are quoted below: 1. Al-Haafiz Abul-Hasan al-Aabiri said: &quot;The mutawaatir reports from the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) describing the Mahdi are very many. They state that the Mahdi will be of his family, that he will rule for seven years, that he will fill the earth with justice, that Eesaa ibn Maryam will emerge and help him to kill the Dajjaal, and that he will lead this ummah in prayer and Eesaa will pray behind him.&quot; 2. Muhammad al-Barzanji said, in his book al-Ishaaah li Ashraat al-Saaah: &quot;The major signs and the signs that will be immediately followed by the Hour: these signs are many, of which the Mahdi will be the first. Know that the ahaadeeth that have been narrated about him in various reports are numerous.&quot; He also said: &quot;You know that the ahaadeeth which speak of the Mahdi, his appearance at the end of time, and his lineage and descent from the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) via Faatimah reach the level of tawaatur in meaning, so there is no point in denying them.&quot; 3. Al-Allaamah Muhammad al-Safaareeni said: &quot;There are so many reports which speak of the appearance of the Mahdi that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning; they are very popular among the scholars of Sunnah and have become part of their faith.&quot; Then he quotes a number of ahaadeeth and reports about the appearance of the Mahdi and the names of the Sahaabah from whom they were narrated: &quot;Many reports were narrated from the Sahaabah whose names were mentioned and others whose names were not mentioned, may Allaah be pleased with them all, and from the Taabieen after them, all of which proves that this is definitive knowledge. Belief in the appearance of the Mahdi is obligatory, as it has been confirmed by the scholars and is listed among the beliefs of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah.&quot; 4. Al-Allaamah al-Mujtahid al-Shawkaani said: &quot;The ahaadeeth that we have come across that speak of the awaited Mahdi reach the level of tawaatur, including fifty saheeh, hasan and daeef munjabar ahaadeeth. There are mutawaatir without a doubt; indeed they are more mutawaatir than others, according to all the standards of usool. There are also many reports from the Sahaabah that speak about the Mahdi and that reach the level of marfoo, so there is no room for individual opinions in such an issue.&quot; 5. Al-Allaamah al-Shaykh Siddeeq Hasan Khaan said: &quot;Even though there are different versions of reports concerning the Mahdi, they are so many that they reach the level of tawaatur in meaning. They are to be found in al-Sunan and other books of Islam.&quot; 6. Al-Shaykh Muhammad ibn Jafar al-Kattaani said: &quot;The conclusion is that the ahaadeeth narrated concerning the Mahdi are mutawaatir, as are the ahaadeeth concerning the Dajjaal and the descent of Eesaa ibn Maryam, upon whom be peace.&quot; (See Ashraat al-Saaah by Yoosuf ibn Abdullaah al-Waabil, pp. 195-203). You should be aware that some liars have fabricated ahaadeeth about the Mahdi, and others have even claimed to be he, or that he belongs to a group other than Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah. Some of these &quot;false mahdis&quot; have tried to deceive the slaves of Allaah for some worldly gain and to distort the picture of Islaam. Some have started movements and revolutions and gathered those people and supporters whom they were able to deceive. Then they were destroyed, and their lies and falsehood were exposed. None of this affects the belief of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaaah in the Mahdi, upon whom be peace, and that he will undoubtedly appear and rule the earth in accordance with Islamic Shareeah.

    <question>Is it permissible for the imam to read from the Quran during Tarawih prayers in Ramadan? Are prayers not accepted if the Imam reads from Quran during Tarawih prayers?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with reading from the Mus-haf during night prayers in Ramadaan, because this will make the members of the congregation hear all of the Quraan. The Quraan and Sunnah indicate that Quraan should be recited in prayer, whether it is from the Mus-haf or from memory. It was proven that Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) told her freed slave Dhakwaan to lead her in praying qiyaam in Ramadaan, and he used to read from the Mus-haf.

    <title>Advice to an imaam who shaves his beard</title>
    <question>In our centre we pray salat'u tarewea but one of the boy's who actas a Immam used to trim his beard inspite that he is good reciter of quran and also has a good voice.
1. The question is shall we allow him to act as imam beside that there is the altenative of boys who can act as imam.
2. My wife is preganent in our second months she can only fast few days what shall I do to rectify her due days which she didn't fast.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. If your imaam shaves his beard, then you should advise him to let it grow, in adherence to the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). If he refuses, then ask someone else who can recite Qur'aan well, even if he has not memorized as much or does not have as beautiful a voice. If you cannot find anyone but this man who can recite well, then let him lead the prayers, but keep advising him. May Allaah guide him to follow the sunnah and become a leader who sets the right example. One of the scholars was asked the following question: We are led in prayer by a man who shaves his beard. Are we permitted to pray behind him or not? He answered: If this man who shaves his beard is the official permanent imaam in a mosque, you should try to replace him with someone better, and look for someone who is righteous and qualified, and free of this sin, who could be appointed as the imaam. If he is an imaam who always leads the prayers in an office or school, leading zuhr prayers during work hours, then first of all you should advise him of how abhorrent his action is. If he then persists, then try to find someone else who does not have this fault, even if he is less skilled in recitation. But if this is a situation where he is leading the prayers only once, then there is nothing wrong with praying behind him if he goes forward to lead the prayer and you cannot find anyone better than him. In general, such a prayer should be good enough, in sha Allaah, but you should know that you have to advise him and every other Muslim who falls into the error of committing this sin or others. And Allaah knows best. (Fataawa Islaamiyyah, 1/393) A pregnant woman is excused from fasting, and all she has to do is make up the fast later on. See the book titled &quot;70 Issues Relating to Fasting&quot; under the topic of &quot;Women's fasting,&quot; page 34 (Section 17 in English Translation), first paragraph.

    <title>If a Muslim moves    to another country during Ramadan</title>
    <question>What should a Muslim do if he moves from one country to another during Ramadan, where the people started fasting on a different day?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If a person finds himself in a country where the people have already started fasting, he must fast with them, because he must follow the ruling of the country he is in. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, Fast when the people fast, break your fast when the people break their fast, and offer your sacrifice when the people offer their sacrifice. (Reported by Abu Dawood with a jayyid isnaad; there are corroborating reports narrated by Abu Dawood and others). Suppose that he moved from a country where he had begun fasting with the people there, and went to another country. He has to either break his fast or continue fasting according to the ruling of the people in the country to which he has travelled, even if they end their fast earlier than the country where he started fasting. But if it turns out that he has fasted less than twenty-nine days, he must make up the fasts later on, because the hijri month cannot be less than twenty-nine days.</answer>

    <question>What is the importance of 13th, 21st, 22nd, and27th of the Islamic month of Rajab.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. There is nothing special about these particular days at all. All the days of Rajab are special, with no exception, because Rajab is one of the Sacred Months, like Dhool- Qidah, Dhool-Hijjah and Muharram. The thirteenth day of each month - not just Rajab - is one of the three Ayyaam al-Beed (white days) on which it is encouraged to fast. These days are the 13th, 14th, and 15th of each hijri month. Many of those who follow bidah (innovations) think that there is something special about certain days and do special acts of worship on those days, with no sound Islaamic basis or evidence (daleel). Their deeds are not acceptable, because they have innovated something in the religion of Allaah without the permission of Allaah. We ask Allaah to help us follow the Sunnah and avoid bidah.

    <question>I have diabetes type II which is NIDM non-insulin dependent diabetes, I don't use any medicine, I only control diet and I do little physical exercise to keep in right level of my sugar(blood).
I have had this disease for one year and two months. Last Ramadan I fasted some days but I could not continue due to my low level of sugar(blood). This year I feel good (Alhamdu Lillah) I ONLY feel pain in my brain during fasting!? So my question is, is it my DUTY to fast despite my disease? Can I test my blood during fasting times; &quot;causing blood to come from my fingers&quot;?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Can sick people break the fast? Can we check sugar during fasting? Can diabetics fast? Praise be to Allah.Can sick people break the fast? It is prescribed for sick people not to fast in Ramadan, if fasting will cause harm or make the sickness worse, or if they need treatment during the day in the form of medicine or pills that must be swallowed. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Sawm (fasts) must be made up] from other days [al-Baqarah 2:185] Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Allah loves people to avail themselves of His concessions (rukhsah) just as He hates them to commit sin. According to another version, As He loves His commands to be obeyed. Can we check sugar during fasting? With regard to taking blood from veins for testing etc., the correct view is that this does not break the fast, but if it is done often, it is better to leave it until night-time. If it is done during the day then to be on the safe side that day should be made up, because this is akin to cupping. (Fatwa of Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him), from Fatawa Islamiyyah, vol. 2, p. 139) Can diabetics fast? Sickness is of various kinds: That which does not affect the fast, such as a light cold or mild headache or toothache, and the like. In this case it is not permissible to break the fast, even though some of the scholars permitted that because of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): and whoever is ill[al-Baqarah 2:185] But we say that this ruling is based on a reason, which is that not fasting is easier. If that is the case, then we would say that not fasting is better, but if fasting does not have an effect on him then it is not permissible to break the fast, and he has to fast. If fasting is difficult for the sick person, but it does not harm him, then it is makruh for him to fast and it is Sunnah for him to break his fast. If fasting is difficult for him and will cause him harm , such as a man who has kidney disease or diabetes and similar cases where fasting will cause harm. In this case fasting is haram. Hence we may see that some mujtahids and sick people make a mistake when fasting is difficult for them and may harm them, but they refuse to break their fast. We say that they are mistaken because they refuse to accept the kindness of Allah and the concession that He has given to them, and they are harming themselves, although Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And do not kill yourselves[al-Nisa 4:29] (Al-Sharh al-Mumti by Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin, vol. 6, 352-254) And Allah knows best.</answer>

This frequently happens to her and causes a real difficulty for praying specially out side the home and as you know women in this country go out of their home frequently. What is the judgment on these liquids (pure or inpure) and should she change the underwar every time!? and What is the status of her wudu?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. What is well-known is that the scholars say that everything that is discharged from the front and back passages is naajis (impure) except for one thing, semen, which is taahir (pure); apart from that everything else that has substance is naajis and breaks ones wudoo. On this basis, whatever fluid comes out of a woman is naajis and requires her to renew her wudoo. This is what I understand after researching the issue with some scholars and consulting reference material. However, I did not feel entirely comfortable about this issue, because some women always have this discharge; if this is the case, then she should handle it as incontinence is handled: if she has wudoo she should wash her private parts when the time for prayer comes, and be careful not to let the urine contaminate her. This is similar to the advice that the Prophet gave to the woman suffering from istihaadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding). Having also discussed the matter with some doctors, it is clear that if the discharge is from the bladder, the woman should do as described above; if it is from the vagina then she must perform wudoo because of it, but the discharge is taahir and she does not have to wash her clothes if it gets on them.</answer>

    <title>Munkar actions during mourning    ceremonies</title>
    <question>We would like to ask you to explain to us whether what we do during mourning ceremonies or obsequies is correct according to shareeah. We do the following:
We recite Soorat al-Faatihah over the grave of the deceased.
The offering of condolences may last for three days or more, and we eat and drink during the mourning ceremonies.
Twenty-five riyaals are collected from each person and the money is given to the family of the deceased.
We slaughter a sheep or similar animal three days after the death.
We gather pebbles whilst saying Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah out loud, and put them on the grave of the deceased.
The women raise their voices, weeping and wailing, and they strike their cheeks and eulogize the deceased.
The women wear clothes of coarse black cloth as a sign of mourning.
The women do not do any kind of work during their iddah period, such as preparing food or doing any other kind of work that is usually done by women.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There are jaahili customs, or reprehensible innovations, and you have to give them up and explain to others that they are wrong. With regard to reciting Quraan over the grave of the deceased, this is not permissible, and none of the Salaf did this. If it were good to do this, they would have done it before us. It has been reported that Soorat Yaa-Seen should be recited for the person who is dying, before his soul departs, but after he has died and when he is being buried and after the burial, there is nothing that should be recited, and one should not tell him to say Laa ilaaha ill-Allaah and so on. Offering condolences is Sunnah, but it need not be during the mourning ceremonies. Condolences may be offered to the family of the deceased in all places. There is nothing wrong with all the relatives of the deceased gathering together in one place so that people may come and offer their condolences, but they should not gather for the purpose of eating. Food should be prepared only for the immediate family of the deceased; it is makrooh for them to offer food to others. There is no need to gather this money from everyone, unless the family are poor, in which case they may be given zakaat funds. It is not permissible to slaughter this sheep, whether it is from the wealth of the deceased or from someone else. But if food is prepared for the family of the deceased, from one or more animals, there is nothing wrong with this. Collecting these pebbles, and making dhikr whilst doing so, and putting them on the grave  this is a reprehensible innovation (bidah) which must be given up and denounced. Raising ones voice in wailing and lamenting, striking the cheeks and eulogizing the deceased are all bidah and actions of the jaahiliyyah. It was reported in a hadeeth: He is not one of us who strikes his cheeks, rends his garments and calls with the call of the jaahiliyyah. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1294, Fath 3/163; Muslim, 103; Ahmad, 1/244). Wearing black as a sign of mourning for the deceased is bidah; but the wives of the deceased should avoid wearing fancy or adorned clothes, jewellery, makeup and perfume during their period of mourning. It is bidah for women to avoid their usual work and activities; the newly-widowed woman can still prepare food, clean the house, wash the dishes, do laundry, etc. There is nothing wrong with her doing that. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>The fate of one    who does not pay zakaah</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on a person who testifies that there is no god except Allaah and establishes regular prayers, but he does not pay zakaah and does not accept that? What is the Islamic ruling on such a person if he dies  can the funeral prayer be offered for him or not?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Zakaah is one of the pillars of Islam. If a person does not do it because he does not believe that it is obligatory, the ruling should be explained to him and if he persists, then he is a kaafir, and the funeral prayer cannot be offered for him and he cannot be buried in the Muslim graveyard. But if he does not pay zakaah because he is stingy, but he believes that it is obligatory, then he is a sinner who is guilty of a major sin and he is a wrong doer, but he is not a kaafir. Therefore he should be washed (ghusl) and the funeral prayer should be offered for him if he dies in this state, and his case will be decided on the Day of Resurrection.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It would be a great deed, If you can allow Muslims slaughter lamp according to Islamic Laws. If you can not, the only thing you can do is to sell them the lambs so they could take care of the matter on their own. However, I urge you to try to ease matters as much as possible for Muslims so they could slaughter the lamps at your farm, for they may not be able to find as suitable of a place as your farm.

    <question>We are from Fall River High School in California. We would like to know about the materials used in making Islamic bridal dresses as well as any religious significance they might have.
Thank You</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There isn't any special material in Islam for wedding cloths. Islamic Sharee'a( Ruling ) is merciful not to place such provisions. However, there are general guidelines like forbidding men from wearing items that are specific to women such natural silk or gold since both degrade manhood. Furthermore; women are forbidden to dress like men. All of this is based on the concern of the Islamic Sharee'a to distinguish between the two sexes since the removal of such distinction is primary causes for corruption and decadence.</answer>

    <title>Is Alcohol-based Perfume Haram?</title>
    <question>I would like to ask you if wearing perfume such as CK Eternity, or Aramis which contains Alcohol SD, or Alcohol denat.</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.We need to talk at length about the issue of perfumes that are said to contain cologne or alcohol . If the percentage of alcohol in perfume is very little, we say that it does not matter, and a person may use them without any concern, such as if the alcohol content is 5% or less. This does not matter. If the percentage of alcohol in perfume is very high, so that you can detect it, then it is better not to use it except where it is necessary, such as for sterilizing wounds and the like. In cases where it is not necessary, it is better not to use it, but we do not say that it is haram. The most we can say is that this high alcohol content is an intoxicant, and no doubt consuming intoxicants is haram according to the texts of Islam and the consensus of the scholars, but is using it in ways other than drinking it permissible? This is open to speculation, but to be on the safe side we should not use it. If you say that it is open to speculation because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Intoxicants, gambling, al-ansab [animals that are sacrificed on stone altars for idols], and al-azlam [arrows for seeking luck or decision], are an abomination of Shaytans handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) in order that you may be successful. Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from al-salah (the prayer). So will you not then abstain? [al-Maidah 5:90-91], then we look at the general meaning of the phrase So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination), and say that alcohol should be avoided in all cases, whether it is drunk or applied to the skin, or used in some other way. If we look at the reason why, Allah says, Shaytan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and gambling, and hinder you from the remembrance of Allah and from the prayer. So will you not then abstain? We may understand this to mean that only drinking it is forbidden , because applying it to the skin does not lead to that (enmity and hatred, etc.). So, in conclusion, we say that if the percentage of alcohol in this perfume is low, there is no need to worry about using it, but if it is high, then it is better to avoid it unless it is for a need, such as sterilizing wounds and the like. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Meaning of taghanni (reciting in a melodious voice) in Quraan recitation</title>
    <question>I have heard that there are ahaadeeth which indicate that it is allowed to recite the Quraan in a melodious voice (taghanni). How are we to understand these ahaadeeth?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Reciting in a melodious voice (taghanni) may mean: 1  Making the voice beautiful when reciting, whilst reciting aloud in a tone that conveys the feelings of humility, softening of the heart and sadness, without making too much effort or exaggerating. Taghanni means reciting aloud, as it was narrated in Saheeh Muslim that Abu Hurayrah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Allaah does not listen to anything (more approvingly) than He listens to a Prophet reciting the Quraan aloud in a melodious voice This indicates that we are commanded and encouraged to make our voices beautiful when reciting Quraan. This hadeeth clearly states the meaning of taghanni. The phrase reciting aloud explains it. Reciting aloud means raising ones voice when reciting and making it beautiful, in a natural manner with no artifice, which one enjoys and finds pleasure in. Before the Quraan was revealed, the Arabs used to sing hudaa (songs of camel drivers) when riding camels, to make the journey pass more quickly when they were sitting in their saddles, and so on. But when the Quraan was revealed, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to make them focus on the Quraan and raise their voices and make them beautiful when reciting it. He wanted that to take the place of singing, whilst paying attention to the correctness of the recitation. So in place of the pleasure of singing, they were given the pleasure of reciting Quraan, just as everything forbidden was replaced with something that was better for them. So istikhaarah was prescribed in place of seeking decisions from azlaam (arrows for divination) and marriage in place of fornication, and so on. 2  It may be that what is meant by taghanni is that which resembles singing and music, and impressing others with the tune, without understanding and without any humility, as mentioned in the hadeeth which describes the Signs of the Hour. 3  It is unlikely that taghanni means being content with the Quraan alone and having no need of people, because the meaning is different and is linguistically unacceptable. This making the voice melodious in recitation should be done in a natural manner, not by means of teaching and training according to the rules of music. Ibn al-Qayyim mentioned that reciting Quraan with a tune and in a melodious voice, if it is done naturally with no exaggeration or special teaching or training, then it is permissible. If extra effort is added to the natural tone to make it more beautiful, such as when Abu Moosa al-Ashari said to the Prophet SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), If I had known (you were listening), I would have made it more beautiful for you, then that is OK. But if the reciting in a melodious voice is done in an artificial manner, with special training and musical rhythms, this is something which the salaf despised, and which they criticized and condemned. It is known that the salaf used to recite the Quraan in a sad tone, making their voices beautiful and giving it a sad tone sometimes and a joyful tone sometimes. This is something natural. Defining the meaning of making the voice melodious (taghanni) (a)I say: there is no dispute concerning the validity of the fatwa of Imaam Maalik which is based on the hadeeth of the Signs of the Hour, with its various isnaads, and which states that it is not permitted to recite with a musical tune and following the rules of music in a manner that goes beyond the limits of recitation and correct pronunciation, and does not befit the dignity of the Quraan. (b)The ahaadeeth of Anas and Abu Dharr (may Allaah be pleased with them both) refer to the recitation of the Khawaarij, who used to recite the Quraan throughout the night and day, but it did not go any deeper than their throats or collar bones, because they did not have knowledge of the Sunnah which clarifies matters, so they were deprived of proper understanding and the reward for recitation. In the ahaadeeth it says that they would exit from the religion like an arrow passing through its target. The ahaadeeth contain the command to kill them and says that they are the most evil of creation, even though you would think that your prayer and your recitation are as nothing when compared with their prayer and recitation. This is the description of the Khawaarij and those who are like them. Ibn Taymiyah said: the hadeeth about the Khawaarij is saheeh in ten different isnaads, which were narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, and some of which were narrated by al-Bukhaari. The Khawaarij used to denounce the Muslims as kaafirs merely for committing sins, but they were the followers of bidah (innovations) and misinterpretations who had split away from the mainstream of the ummah. We ask Allaah to keep us safe and sound in our religious commitment and their worldly affairs. This is a description which applies only to the Khawaarij and those who are like them. The reciters nowadays are not like this as far as we know. (c)The fatwa of Imaam Ahmad has to do with distorting the letters and exaggerating elongated vowels, which results from altering the letters and elongating them too much, which takes the recitation beyond what is correct. This fatwa states that it is emphatically disliked, as al-Qaadi Abu Yalaa said. This refers to someone who goes to extremes and whose recitation is not correct, because he adds letters, such as adding waw and alif to the word Muhammad, making it Moohaamad. This is haraam, according to consensus. At the time of Imaam Ahmad, the people used to sing poetry and elongate the letters however they wished. Ishaaq al-Mawsili criticized Ibraaheem ibn al-Mahdi for doing that, because he distorted the words from the way they should be in Arabic. And denouncing that in the case of reciting Quraan in a melodious voice is more essential, and this problem does not exist nowadays, praise be to Allaah. (d)Ibn Taymiyah said: the kind of tune which the scholars regard as makrooh for reciting Quraan in is that which involves shortening long letters, lengthening short letters, giving a vowel to a silent letter, or making a vowelled letter silent, in order to make it fit the rules of music. If that also involves changing the way the Quraan should be recited and elongating the vowels, then this is haraam. Reconciling between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed There is no contradiction between the evidence which says it is forbidden and the evidence which says it is allowed if the prohibition applies to that which goes beyond the limits of correct recitation, whether by adding or taking away, or by neglecting an obligatory rule, or by going against the well-established rules of recitation. The prohibition also applies to that which is recited according to the rules of music, even if it is without the accompaniment of instruments, to make the voice tremble or quaver, or exaggerating in going along with a particular musical key which is in the reciters mind whilst he is reciting. The permission applies only to that which is in accordance with the rules of sound recitation whilst making the voice beautiful. If what is meant by giving a tune is adding or taking away anything, or going against the well-established rules of recitation, this is haraam. If I mean making the voice melodious in recitation (taghanni), in order to make the listener feel happy or sad, or to soften his heart or to make the recitation attractive whilst also pondering the meanings and reflecting humility, then it is mustahabb, so long as it does not distort the meaning or change the pronunciation, or follow the rules of music. Al-Suyooti said: Reciting Quraan with a tune and with beautiful, quavering voices, so long as it does not deviate from the correct way of reciting, is a good way (Sunnah hasanah); if it does deviate from the correct way of reciting, then it is haraam and is an evil deed. And he said in Sharh al-Risaalah: From the comments of the imams it may be understood that making the voice beautiful whilst paying attention to the rules of music and also following the rules of recitation is an area that is subject to scholarly dispute. Some of the scholars said that this is different from the way of the salaf, because the reader may neglect to recite properly, so they said that this was not permitted, in order to prevent the means that may lead to something haraam. But making the voice beautiful whilst reciting Quraan, without paying attention to the rules of music is what is required, and there is no dispute concerning this. Ibn Qudaamah said: the scholars are agreed that it is mustahabb to read Quraan with a sad tone, with a measured pace and with a beautiful voice. I say: this is taken from the hadeeth of Buraydah, Recite the Quraan in a sad tone for it was revealed with sadness. And the hadeeth of Ibn Abbaas: The best of people in reciting Quraan is the one who recites it in a sad tone. But these hadeeths are both daeef (weak) and the first one is daeef jiddan (very weak).</answer>

    <question>So far I have
   learned 33 of the 99 Arabic names for Allah (SWT), I don't have a list of the rest. Where
   can I find it on the internet, or perhaps you know them?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Allaah has many names, all of which are indicative of His Greatness, Perfection and Majesty, may He be glorified and exalted. He has told us some of these Names in His Book and through the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him); He also has other Names which are known only to Him, as is indicated in the hadeeth of 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 'There is nobody who is afflicted with distress or grief and who says: &quot;Allaahumma inni 'abduka wa ibn 'abdika wa ibn amatika, naasiyati bi yadika maadin fiyya hukmuka 'adlun fiyya qadaa'uka, as'aluka bi kulli ismin huwa laka sammayta bihi nafsaka aw 'allamtahu ahadan min khalqika aw anzaltahu fi kitaabika aw asta'tharta bihi fi 'ilmi al-ghaybi 'indaka an taj'al al-Qur'aana rabee'a qalbi wa noor sadri wa jilaa'a huzni wa dhihaaba hammi (O Allaah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant, my forelock is in Your hand, Your command over me is ever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask You by every name belonging to You which You have named Yourself with, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of Your creation, or You have preserved in the knowledge of the Unseen with You, that You make the Qur'aan the life of my heart and the light of my breast, and a departure for my sorrow and a release for my anxiety,&quot; - but Allaah will take away his distress and grief, and replace it with ease.' He was asked, 'O Messenger of Allaah, should we not learn it?' He said, 'Of course, whoever hears it should learn it.'&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; this is a saheeh hadeeth). The Names of Allaah mentioned in the Qur'aan and Sunnah number over one hundred, as several scholars have agreed (see Al-Qawaa'id al-Muthlaa fi Sifaat Allaahi wa Asmaa'ihi by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn 'Uthaymeen). Among these are ninety-nine names which, if one learns them and acts in accordance with them, will bring a great reward, as is indicated in the hadeeth narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him), in which the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Allaah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one; whoever learns them will enter Paradise.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, al-Fath, no. 2736) The learning referred to in the hadeeth includes the following: Memorizing them. Understanding their meanings. Acting upon them: so if a person learns that Allaah is al-Ahad (the One and Only), he will not associate anything else with Him; if he learns that He is al-Razzaaq (the Provider), he will not seek provision from anyone else; if he learns that He is al-Raheem (the Most Merciful), he will not despair of His Mercy, and so on. Calling upon Allaah by these Names, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them&quot; [al-A'raaf 7:180] - so one might say &quot;Yaa Rahmaan arhamni (O Most Merciful, have mercy on me),&quot; &quot;Yaa Ghafoor ighfir li (O All-Forgiving, forgive me),&quot; &quot;Yaa Tawwaab, tubb 'alayya (O Accepter of Repentance, turn towards me in forgiveness),&quot; and so on. If you pay attention to the endings of many aayaat, you will find many of the names of Allah mentioned there. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <question>I would be very grateful if you could advise me on the fundamental differences between the main sects of Islam, although I know that originally Islam was a unified religion.
Thankyou.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The answer to your question is lengthy and deserves a book to itself. We cannot answer in details here, but we can say the following in brief: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us beforehand that this Ummah would be divided as the previous nations were divided, as stated in the saheeh hadeeth: Wahb ibn Baqiyyah told us from Khaalid from Muhammad ibn Amr from Abu Salamah from Abu Hurayrah who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Jews were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and the Christians were divided into seventy-one or seventy-two sects, and my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects. This was narrated by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, Kitaab al-Sunnah, Baab Sharh al-Sunnah. It was reported from Awf ibn Maalik who said: the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Jews were divided into seventy-one sects, one of which is in Paradise and seventy are in the Fire. The Christians were divided into seventy-two sects, seventy-one of which are in the Fire and one is in Paradise. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, my Ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects, one of which will be in Paradise and seventy-two will be in the Fire. It was said, O Messenger of Allaah, who are they? He said, Al-Jamaaah. Sunan Ibn Maajah, no. 3982. What is meant by al-Jamaaah is the aqeedah and actions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions. Among the sects that claim to belong to Islam are those who are misguided with regard to the Unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and His Names and Attributes; they say that everything that exists is Allaah and that He is incarnate or present in His creation  glorified be He far above what they say. On the contrary, He is above His heavens, settled on His throne, distinct from His creation. Others are misguided with regard to eeman (faith) and say that deeds are separate from faith and that faith does not increase or decrease. The correct view is that faith consists of words and deeds; it increases when one does acts of obedience to Allaah and decreases when one commits sin. Others are misguided by their declaring that the person who commits sin goes beyond the pale of Islam and is doomed to eternity in the Fire. The correct view is that the one who commits a major sin  apart from shirk and al-kufr al-akbar  does not go out of Islam. Others are misguided with regard to the issue of al-qadaa wal-qadar (divine decree), and said that man has no choice in what he does. The correct view is that man has freedom of will on the basis of which he will be called to account and will bear the consequences of his deeds. Others are misguided with regard to the Quraan, and say that it is created. The correct view is that it is the words of Allaah, revealed not created. Others are misguided with regard to the Sahaabah, whom they revile and denounce as kaafirs even though they are the companions of the Prophet among whom the Wahy (Revelation) was revealed, and they are the most knowledgeable and the most devoted in worship among this Ummah, and they strove in jihaad for the sake of Allaah and Allaah supported this religion through them  may Allaah be pleased with them all. And there are other groups who deviated from the path of Islam and innovated matters in the religion of Allaah; each of them rejoices in what they have, but they have followed the ways of the Shaytaan and gone against the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): And verily, this is My straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious) [al-Anaam 6:153] We ask Allaah to make us among the followers of the Sunnah who will be saved from the Fire, and to admit us to Paradise among the righteous. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

(Al-Bukhaari, 1503). Abu Saeed al-Khudri (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: We used to pay as Zakaat al-Fitr a saa of food or a saa of barley (which was their food at that time) or a saa or dates or a saa of aqit (dried yoghurt) or a saa of raisins. (1506) From this it is clear that Zakaat al-Fitr must be food, not money, so we must adhere to what has been recorded in the Sunnah. So give one saa of whatever is the staple food in your country, such as rice or wheat, for example, on behalf of yourself and each member of your household. (A saa is equivalent to approximately 3 kilograms). It is not permissible to give it to anyone except a needy Muslim. If you cannot find anyone in your own country, you can delegate someone else to give it on your behalf in another country. May Allaah help us and you to do the duties that He loves. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Acceptance of righteous deeds from one who commits zina</title>
    <question>Will Allah accept the prayer and good deeds of a person who is continually committing sin such as fornification eventhough in his/her heart the person is aware that he/she is sinning and is full of guilt and tries his/her very best not to continue committing such sin. Except for this weakness this person tries
to be a good muslim e.g. never misses daily prayers, giving out time and money towards the cause of Allah, never take alcohol or other un-halal foods etc.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Yes, Allaah will accept whatever righteous deeds he does, such as praying, fasting, giving charity etc., and He will also accept his repentance, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): And He it is Who accepts repentance from His slaves, and forgives sins, and He knows what you do. [al-Shooraa 42:25]. But there is the condition that his repentance must be sincere. Does this person truly regret what he has done? Is he indeed determined not to repeat the sin? Has he, I wonder, gotten rid of everything that may lead him to sin, such as relationships, addresses, telephone numbers, going to evil places, bad friends, movies, pictures and so on? What we believe is that if this person truly repents, he will give up this sin. Zina is one of the worst kinds of immoral deeds. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a faahishah [i.e., anything that transgresses its limits, a great sin], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allaah forgives him). [al-Isra 17:32]. Married people who commit zina (adultery) are to be punished with the worst and most severe form of punishment, which is to be stoned to death, so that every part of their bodies may feel pain just as they felt pleasure in a haraam manner even though they were not without a halaal source of pleasure (i.e., within marriage). Unmarried people who commit zinaa, and had never been married before, are to be given the maximum number of lashes prescribed in shareeah, which is one hundred lashes. In addition, they are subjected to the humiliation of having their punishment witnessed by a group of believers, and are to be banished for one full year from their city, the place where they committed the crime. The punishment for those who are guilty of zinaa in Barzakh (i.e., after death and before the Day of Resurrection) is that they will be in an oven, the top of which is narrow and the bottom of which is wide. A fire will be lit under it, and they will be naked in (that oven). When the fire is lit, they will scream and rise up until they almost come out of the oven, then when the fire subsides, they will go back down into it. This is what will keep happening to them until the Hour begins. So how will their punishment be in the Fire of Hell itself? We ask Allaah not to despise us and to accept our repentance; we ask Him to help us to do good and to avoid evil, for He is the All-Hearing, Ever-Near.</answer>

    <title>Wearing neckties</title>
    <question>Can you tell me what is the ruling in wearing ties. some people say it is haram and others say no.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The Muslim is supposed to be distinct from non-Muslims in his appearance and clothing, because this is what Islam says. Also, the Muslim should not wear anything that is the distinctive clothing of the kuffaar. With regard to neckties, if a person can do without them, this is better, but if he has to wear them there is nothing wrong with that, in sha Allaah  but he should make sure that they are not made of natural silk and that they do not have crosses or pictures of animate creatures on them.

the Holy Spirit.In the Islamic religion, does the dove hold any significance ?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.We put this question to Shaykh Abd-Allaah ibn Jibreen, may Allaah preserve him, who answered as follows. The dove does not have any particular meaning in Islam. It is simply one of the birds that Allaah has permitted us to eat, just like any other permissible bird. In Islam, the dove does not stand for peace or for anything else.

    <question>What is the ruling on saying in
   ones duaa: O Allaah, I ask You by the virtue of So and so?
   Is there any difference between this and saying to the occupant of a grave, O So and
   so, help me!?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to ask Allaah by the virtue of anyone, not even by the virtue of the Prophets or Messengers or awliyaa or righteous people. No one can compel Allaah to do anything. It is not permissible to ask Him in any way except by His Names and Attributes, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them [al-Araaf 7:180]. With regard to saying to the occupant of a grave, O So and so, help me, this is obviously shirk, because it is a supplication to someone other than Allaah. Asking by the virtue of someone is a means to shirk, and calling upon a created being is shirk in worship. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>A Muslim must perform hajj for himself first</title>
    <question>My mother recently passed away, on the first of Ramadan. She never
performed Hajj, so I am planning to do that on her behalf. My question
is: can I perform Hajj for her even though I have not yet performed
Hajj for myself?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. I ask Allaah to reward you for your kind feelings towards your mother and your eagerness to perform your filial duty towards her after her death. In response to your question, if a Muslim wishes to perform Hajj on behalf of someone else, he must first have performed it for himself. The daleel (evidence) for that is the hadeeth of Ibn Abbaas, according to which the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) heard a man saying Labbayk (here I am) on behalf of Shubrumah [i.e., he was performing Hajj on behalf of Shubrumah]. He (the Prophet) asked, Who is Shubrumah? The man said: He is a brother (or a relative) of mine. He asked, Have you performed Hajj for yourself? He said, No. He told him: Perform Hajj for yourself, first, then perform Hajj on behalf of Shubrumah. (Reported by Abu Dawud in Al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Manaasik, Baab al-rajul yuhijj an ghayrihi). This is a saheeh hadeeth. I ask Allaah to forgive your mother and extend His Mercy to her, for Allah is the best of Helpers.</answer>

    <title>Can Women Go Out During the Nifas Period?</title>
    <question>I am living in Oman, where women follow a practice of remaining in the house for 40 days following the birth of a child. I have asked several people about this.Most people do not seem to know if it is sunnah or not. If it is, I would like to try to follow the practice (I am in the 9th month of my 4th pregnancy). However, I have also been told it is a bid'ah practice and therefore I should avoid it. Please try to clear up this issue, which I have been researching for almost 6 years!</question>
    <answer>Contents Related 40-Day Rule after Birth in Islam Can women go out during the nifas period? Praise be to Allah.40-Day Rule after Birth in Islam Forty days is the longest period that the woman in nifas can refrain from praying and fasting , so long as blood is still flowing. After that, she should do ghusl and pray, and consider herself to be in a state of istihadah (irregular vaginal bleeding which is neither menstruation nor nifas) if the bleeding does not stop. Umm Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) said: At the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the woman in nifas would sit (i.e., refrain from praying and fasting) for forty days (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi). Can women go out during the nifas period? With regard to the belief that a woman has to stay in her house for forty days after giving birth and not go out, this is a mistaken belief and women do not have to do this. It is permissible for them to go out during these forty days to any place she wants, so long as she fulfills the shari conditions (i.e., hijab etc.) And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Finding Noah&amp;#146;s ark</title>
    <question>Assalaamualaikum, I have heard that Noah's ark was found a few years ago using references from the Quran as opposed to the bible. Is this true?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;The people of Nuh denied (their Messenger) before them, they rejected Our slave, and said: A madman! and he was insolently rebuked and threatened. Then he invoked his Lord (saying): I have been overcome, so help (me)! So We opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth. And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs. So the waters (of the heaven and the earth) met for a matter predestined. And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails, Floating under Our Eyes, a reward for him who had been rejected! And, indeed, We have left this as a sign, is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)? Then how (terrible) was My Torment and My Warnings!&quot; [al-Qamar 54:9-16] In his Tafseer, Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &quot;And, indeed, We have left this as a sign, is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)? refers to this story, which serves as a lesson.&quot; It was also suggested that it referred to the ship or ark itself, which was left so that those who came after the people of Nuh might learn lessons from it and not reject the Messengers. Qutaadah said: &quot;Allaah left it in Baaqirdi in the Arabian Peninsula (a place in Iraq), as a lesson and a sign, so that the first generations of this ummah would see it. How many ships have there been after it that have turned to dust and left no trace!&quot; The apparent meaning is that this refers to ships in general, as in the aayaat (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And an aayah (sign) for them is that We bore their offspring in the laden ship (of Nuh), And We have created for them of the like thereunto, so on them they ride.&quot; Yaa-Seen 36:41-42] &quot;Verily! When the water rose beyond its limits [Nuhs Flood], We carried you [mankind] in the floating (ship that was constructed by Nuh). That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear (person) may (hear and) understand it.&quot; [al-Haaqqah 69:11-12] Hence Allaah says here &quot;is there then any that will remember (or receive admonition)?&quot; i.e., is there anyone who will remember and learn? In his tafseer of the words &quot;We have left this as a sign&quot; Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, mentions three opinions: 1. That Allaah has left this story as a lesson to those who come after the people of Nuh; 2. That Allaah has left the ship of Nuh so that subsequent nations may see it and learn from it how Allaah saved the believers and destroyed the kuffaar. 3. That Allaah taught mankind how to make ships and left this invention as a reminder of His blessings and how Nuhs children and the believers were saved by means of a ship like those which are well-known. In any case, there is nothing that would go against either Islamic teaching or reason if Nuhs ark were to be discovered and if generations of mankind after Nuh were to see it, because it would be a sign to them. The issue would be how to prove that the ship discovered was really Nuhs ark; not everyone who finds an ancient ship and claims it to be Nuhs ark is to be believed. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The Braylwiyyah are a Soofeesect which was born in India at the time of the British rule there. It's followers concernthemselves in exceeding in their love and honour for the Prophets and the &quot;saints&quot; in general, and the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) specifically. It's founder was a man bythe name of Ahmad Ridhaa Khaan ibn Taqee 'Alee Khaan who was born in 1272 A.H. (1851 C.E.) and called himself Abdul-Mustafaa (slave/servant of Mustafaa, i.e. Muhammad (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wasallam)). He was born in the city ofBraylee in the province of Uttar Pradesh and was a student of al-Mirza GhulaamQaadir Begg who was the older (blood) brother of Mirza Ghulaam Ahmad al-Qaadiyaanee (founder of the Qaadiyaaniyyah sect). He was of a slim build andknown to be shrewd and clever, whilst also being ill-tempered and foul-mouthed. He used to suffer from chronic illnesses, and used to consistently complain ofheadaches and back pains. He visitedMakkahand studied under some of thescholars there in 1295 A.H. (1874 C.E.). Amongst his &quot;notable&quot; booksare: Anbaa. al-Mustafaa and Khaalis al-I'tiqaad.

And they have exceeded intheir belief with respect to the Prophet (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) suchthat they have ascended him to a rank close to that of worshipping him. And theyhave exceeded in their belief with respect to the Messenger of Allaah (sal-Allaahu `alayhe wa sallam) such that they believe he has knowledge of the unseen, and they deny that he was a human being, rather that he was the light (noor) of Allaah.

    <question>Assalamu ALikum Rahmatullahi wa Baraktuh,
I want to know about pictures of people in Islam, specifically those used in children's books. Is it permisable to illustrate children's books about Islam with pictures of muslims? If so, what is the basis for this, and if not what is the basis? There is so much controvery about this issue, and I fear Allah because of the Sahih hadeeth about Allah cursing the picture-makers. Still, how are we to educate our children about Islam in this Western Society without children's books with pictures in them? Also, what is your opinion about the book The Lawful and the Prophibited in Islam? Is this a truestworthy publication?
JazkAllahkhairun for your efforts!! Walikum Salam Rahmatullahi wa Baraktuh.</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah. On the subject of photographs, please refer to question # 365. Know, my sister, that we should be careful about pictures of animate beings, lest we do something that has been forbidden by Allaah and His Messenger. I wonder what urgent need there can be for putting pictures of Muslims in children's books. If we want to make the books attractive to them, there are plenty of colours, advanced methods of printing and pictures of inanimate objects such as trees, flowers, cars, houses etc., which can be used instead of pictures of animate beings. As for useful books which we need to keep at home, like reference books and dictionaries that may contain pictures that are difficult to erase, we can keep them as long as we blot out any pictures on the cover. Whatever does not need to be kept, like newspapers, should be disposed of after reading. As for the book &quot;Al-Halaal wa'l-Haraam fi'l-Islam,&quot; the author was very lenient in a number of issues, may Allaah forgive him. Some scholars have written refutations of this book, such as Shaykh Saaleh al-Fawzaan, who wrote Al-I'laam bi naqd kitaab al-halaal wa'l-haraam fi'l-Islaam. We ask Allaah to guide us to the truth in those issues concerning which there are differences of opinion, for He guides whom He will to the Straight Path.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on marrying young women</title>
    <question>I need to know, when did the Holy Prophet get married to Hazrat Aisha, there have been claims on newsgroups that the Holy Prophet was a pedophile. I want enough information to be able to answer such allegations.
I need to know everything about this particular marriage, quoting sources. Wa-alaikum</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The answer to your question may be found in the ahaadeeth of Saheeh al-Bukhaari and the commentary of al-Haafiz al-Asqallaani, which are quoted below: Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: &quot;The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me when I was six years old. Then we came to Madeenah and stayed in Bani al-Haarith ibn Khazraj. I fell ill and my hair started to fall out (due to the illness; then it grew back thick again). My mother Umm Roomaan came to me whilst I was on a swing and my friends were with me. She shouted for me and I came to her, not knowing what she wanted. She took me by the hand and led me to the door of the house. I was out of breath and we waited until I had calmed down, then she took some water and wiped my face and head, then took me inside. There were some women of the Ansaar in the house, and they said: &quot; Alaa al-khayri wal-baraka wa ala khayri taair (blessings, best wishes, etc).&quot; My mother handed me over to them and they tidied me up, then suddenly the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was there. It was mid-morning, and they handed me over to him. At that time I was nine years old.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3605). Urwah said: &quot;Khadeejah died three years before the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) migrated to Madeenah. He stayed alone for two years or thereabouts, then he married Aaishah when she was six years old, and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3607) The phrase &quot;he married Aaishah&quot; means that the marriage contract was drawn up; the marriage was consummated later on, when she was nine. Muslim reports from al-Zuhri, from Urwah, that Aaishah said that she was taken to him when she was nine years old, and she took her toys with her. He died when she was eighteen years old. Muslim also reports a similar account from Aaishah via al-Aswad. He reports from Abdullaah ibn Urwah from his father that Aaishah said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married me in Shawwaal and consummated the marriage with me in Shawwaal.&quot; Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) married her when she was six years old and consummated the marriage when she was nine years old, and she stayed with him for nine years.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4738) Al-Bukhaari calls this chapter of his Saheeh &quot;Baab inkaah al-rajul wuldahu (or waladahu) al-sighaar (Chapter on a man marrying off his young children).&quot; The fact that Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;. . . and for those who have no courses [periods] [(i.e., they are still immature) their iddah is three months likewise, except in case of death] . . .&quot; [al-Talaaq 65:4] is an indication that it is permissible to marry girls below the age of adolescence. This is a good understanding, but the aayah makes no specific mention of either the father or the young girl. It could be said that the basic principle concerning marrying children is that it is forbidden unless there is specific evidence (daleel) to indicate otherwise. The hadeeth of Aaishah states that her father Abu Bakr married her off before the age of puberty, but there is no other evidence apart from that, so the rule applies to all other cases. Al- Muhallab said: &quot;[The scholars] agreed that it is permissible for a father to marry off his young virgin daughter, even though it is not usually the case to have intercourse with such a young woman.&quot;(The above was summarized from Fath al-Baari Sharh ala Saheeh al-Bukhaari) In summary, then, it is permitted to contract marriage with a young girl and to hand her over to her husband to stay with him before she reaches adolescence. As for consummating the marriage, this does not happen until she is physically able for it. Thus the matter becomes quite clear. Do you see anything wrong with a man living with his young wife in one house, bringing her up and teaching her, but delaying consummation until she is ready for it? We ask Allaah to show us truth and falsehood and to make each clear. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Manners when talking to women</title>
    <question>I have heard a ruling regarding the reasons a male Muslims is allowed to speak to a Muslim female and want to know if it is correct. It said that there are only five reasons one may talk to her:
1. to ask how her family
2. for medical purposes
3. for financial purposes (e.g. in a shop)
4. to find out about her personality for marriage suitability
5. to give her dawah (Islamic knowledge).
Is this correct? If it is, please provide the evidence from where the ruling is made (i.e. Daleel).</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The conditions for speaking to a woman to whom one is not related are mentioned in the following aayaat (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;. . . And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts . . .&quot; [al-Ahzaab 33:53] &quot;. . . then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire, but speak in an honourable manner.&quot; [al-Ahzaab 33:32] Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his Tafseer: &quot;This means that they should not speak softly. Allaah commanded them to speak in a concise and decisive manner (i.e., they should be serious and brief in their speech, and not be vague or talk aimlessly). There should be no possible indication on the face that could be taken to indicate any softness in the heart, as the Arab women (before Islaam) used to do when speaking to men, by making their voices soft like women who are taking care of small children, or like prostitutes. Allaah forbade women to do that. The phrase &quot;lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire&quot; means lest such a person should hope for immoral deeds, indecency or romance. &quot;Speaking in an honourable manner&quot; means speaking in a way that does not go against Shareeah or offend people. Women are encouraged when speaking to men to whom they are not related and to mahrams among their in-laws to be somewhat rough or abrupt in their speech, without raising the voice, because they are commanded to lower their voice. Speaking with a woman to whom one is not related (i.e., not mahram) should only be for a specific need, such as asking a question, buying or selling, asking about the head of the household, and so on. Such conversations should be brief, with nothing doubtful in either what is said or how it is said. The idea of limiting speech with women to the five instances mentioned in the question needs to be approached with caution, because they could be taken as examples instead of limits. One must also adhere to the conditions set out by the Shareeah even in instances where such conversations are necessary, such as in dawah, giving fatwas, buying or selling, etc. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>If it is not known whether a
    person is a Muslim or a kaafir, can we say salaam to him?</title>
    <question>If I meet a person and I do not know
   whether he is a kaafir or a Muslim, should I say salaam to him or return his greeting or
   not?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It was reported in the hadeeth that you should say salaam to those you know and those you do not (narrated by al-Bukhaari, 12; al-Fath 1/55) but this applies only to Muslims, or those who appear to be Muslim. It was also reported that it is forbidden to say salaam to Jews and Christians, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Do not initiate the greeting of salaam to a Jew or Christian, and if you meet them in the street, push them to the narrowest part of the road. (Narrated by Muslim, 2167). He also said: If the People of the Book greet you with salaam, say wa alaykum (and also upon you). (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6258). But at that time the People of the Book were distinct from the Muslims in their dress and appearance, and they were not allowed to resemble Muslims. But in these times, unfortunately, many Muslims look like them, and we can no longer tell the difference between a Muslim and a Christian. Everyone - except for those whom Allaah wills  looks the same in dress, in being clean-shaven, in wearing nothing on their heads, or wearing western-style caps, so the matter is more confusing. If someone who looks like the mushrikeen says salaam to you, say Wa alaykum, and do not initiate the greeting, because of the uncertainty about him. If he objects and tells you off, then apologize to him. You had reason to act as you did, because you did know whether he was a Muslim or a Christian, because he is not dressing as a Muslim and prefers the dress of the Christians and others. Tell him that whoever imitates a people is one of them (Saheeh, narrated by Imaam Ahmad, 2/50-92), and advise him to distinguish himself from the kuffaar and to dress as the Muslims dress, like his father, grandfathers and the scholars of the Muslims. If he persists in what he is doing, this means that he likes the characteristics of the Christians and is imitating them, and that he despises the Muslims and is going against them, even though he does not gain anything from that besides blind imitation. This indicates that he admires those kuffaar and thinks that their worldly achievements and inventions, etc., stem from their false religion. This is going too far, for the Muslims are wiser and more able to invent and produce, so he should not be deceived by the Mushrikeen.</answer>

    <title>It is not possible to say that someone is Muslim if they did not utter the Shahaadatayn</title>
    <question>if someone who is born nonmuslim (christian ) he/she is honest and never commits major sins and he/she belives everybbody is right on their own religion but knows nothing about islam nobody told them about it and they die in this stage so where will they go on the day of judgement</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The person whose situation is described in the question cannot be said to be a Muslim even if his attitude and morals were good, because he did not utter the Shahaadatayn and did not believe in Allaah as his Lord, Muhammad as his Prophet and Islam as his religion. The belief that all religions on earth are correct and that their followers are all following the truth is one of the gravest falsehoods and one of the greatest examples of kufr. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning); Say: Are those who know equal to those who know not? [al-Zumar 39:9] And not equal are the blind and those who see; nor are (equal) those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous good deeds, and those who do evil. Little do you remember! [Ghaafir 40:58] Say (O Muhammad): Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: (It is) Allaah. Say: Have you then taken (for worship) Awliyaa (protectors) other than Him, such as have no power either for benefit or for harm to themselves? Say: Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light? [al-Rad 13:16] Say (O Muhammad): Not equal are Al-Khabeeth (all that is evil and bad as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods) and At-Tayyib (all that is good as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods) [al-Maaidah 5:100] Not alike are the blind (disbelievers in Islamic Monotheism) and the seeing (believers in Islamic Monotheism). Nor are (alike) darkness (disbelief) and light (belief in Islamic Monotheism). Nor are (alike) the shade and the suns heat. Nor are (alike) the living (i.e., the believers) and the dead (i.e., the disbelievers). Verily, Allaah makes whom He wills to hear, but you cannot make hear those who are in graves [Faatir 35:19-22] With regard to the ultimate destiny of the person referred to in the question, and whether he will be excused for his ignorance or not, and what his situation will be on the Day of Resurrection, we believe that his case rests with Allaah. A similar question has already been answered  please refer to Question # 2443And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Why Is Interest Haram?</title>
    <question>As we know interest is haram in Islam but can you please tell me why it is haram? I have some money but I don't know how to invest the money. There is someone who knows how to manage this money if I gave him my money and fix some amount for him as interest. We both agree on this and we are both pleased with this decision. Is it still haram? If yes, then can you please explain it for me?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Why is interest haram? Does accepting riba make is halal? Praise be to Allah.Why is interest haram? Riba (which means adding something extra to certain products, like selling gold for gold, or by not receiving something when a contract is signed, or paying extra in return for extension of a loan) is haram because Allah - Who rules as He wills - has forbidden it. No one can ask Him about what He does; He is the One Who will ask people about what they did, on the Day of Resurrection. Allah has explained that riba is haram, and warned those who do not give it up, in the verses (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;O you who believe! Be afraid of Allah and give up what remains (due to you) from riba (usury) (from now onward), if you are (really) believers. And if you do not do it, then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger . . .&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:278-279] Does accepting riba make is halal? One of the most important points to remember about Islamic Shari`ah - and this is one of the major differences between Shari`ah and earthly jahili laws - is that mutual consent to commit a haram deed does not make it halal. If a man and a woman agree to commit zina (fornication or adultery), it does not become halal. If a businessman agrees with the bank to deposit a sum of money in the bank and take interest on it, or to take out a loan and pay interest on it, that does not make such transactions halal. Things that are haram will remain so until the Day of Judgement. Man is ignorant and inclined to do wrong. He may not even know what is in his own interests or in the interests of others, so he may do things that harm himself or others. You state in your question that you want to give some money to a person to invest it, in return for something. There is nothing wrong with that if it is done in accordance with Shari`ah, which includes a contract of silent partnership - i.e., you give money to someone to do business on your behalf, in return for an agreed percentage of the profits. According to Shari`ah, a contract of silent partnership includes the following: The one who receives the money for investment is not permitted to guarantee the capital and is not expected to repay it except in cases of recklessness or negligence. In the event of loss, the investor loses his capital and the one who took the money loses the time and effort invested. May Allah help you and us to earn a halal income. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on wills which deprive some of one's children of their inheritance</title>
    <question>i would like to know can a person cut out any of his childern from the inheritences. because their was some problems between him and his son-in-law. or use it as an excuse to cut his daughters out of the inheritences. can a person that has 10 childern .give one of them more then the other. while he is still alive put in his name a house and land and say it is not haram because it is his money and nobody has anything to do with it.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This will is not permissible, because it goes against the teachings of shareeah and is contrary to the justice and fairness that Allaah has enjoined, especially among one's children. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): There is a share for men and a share for women from what is left by parents and those nearest related, whether, the property be small or large  a legal share [al-Nisaa 4:7] Then Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning); Allaah commands you as regards your childrens (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females; if (there are) only daughters, two or more, their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if only one, her share is a half. For parents, a sixth share of inheritance to each if the deceased left children; if no children, and the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother has a third; if the deceased left brothers or (sisters), the mother has a sixth. (The distribution in all cases is) after the payment of legacies he may have bequeathed or debts. You know not which of them, whether your parents or your children, are nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed shares) are ordained by Allaah. And Allaah is Ever AllKnower, AllWise [al-Nisaa 4:11] Then Allaah warns those who go against this division of legacies and play with it, by saying (interpretation of the meaning); And whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment[al-Nisaa 4:14] Whoever deprives some of his children of their inheritance, or gives some of them less than is their shari due, or gives some more than is their shari due, or includes someone who is not an heir among those who are given his legacy, is a sinner who is guilty of committing a major sin. Also, it is not permissible to make a will concerning ones heir, because he has a share which is defined by shareeah. Ahmad, Abu Dawood and al-Tirmidhi (may Allaah have mercy on them) narrated from Abu Umaamah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah has given everyone who is entitled his rights, so there is no will concerning the heir. (Sunan al-Tirmidhi, 2046). If it is proven according to shareeah that one of the children is a kaafir, e.g. by the fact that he does not pray, at the time of the fathers death, then he is not an heir, even if instructions to that effect are not mentioned in the will, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Muslim does not inherit from the kaafir and the kaafir does not inherit from the Muslim. (Saheeh  agreed upon). With regard to giving a gift to one of one's children and not to the others for no shari reason, this is haraam and is unfair, as it creates hatred in the childrens hearts towards one another. The evidence (daleel) that it is forbidden is the hadeeth narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on them) from al-Numaan ibn Basheer (may Allaah be pleased with him), that his father came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: I have given this son of mine one of my slaves. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Have you given all your children a similar gift? He said, No. He said, Then take it back. According to the version narrated by Muslim, he said: Fear Allaah and treat your children fairly. So my father took back his gift. According to another version, he (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: My father took me to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, O Messenger of Allaah, bear witness that I have given al-Numaan such-and-such of my wealth. He said, Have you given all your children something similar to what you have given to al-Numaan? He said, No. He said, Then let someone else bear witness. Then he said, Would you not like all your children to honour you equally? He said, Of course. He said, Then you should not do that. (Muslim, 3059). But if the gift is being given to one of the children for a shari reason, such as the child being poor, or in debt, or needing medical treatment, then there is nothing wrong with that. And Allaah knows best. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad, and grant him peace.</answer>

    <title>What Did Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) Look Like?</title>
    <question>I was recently reading a description of the physical characteristics of the Noble Prophet. I formed a picture in my mind. Then I saw in a dream, a man who looked like the picture formed in my mind. I do not clearly remember what he said, but I am afraid he might have said that some Muslim brothers who I love very much will see a dream with me in it. I committed a sin in their house before, and before this dream, I was always worrying that they might find out through a dream. How do I know for sure if I saw the Prophet in this dream?
This is worrying me very much. Also, I just had a dream, where I thought it was the Prophet again, during his last recitation of the Quran to Jibreel (AS) during Ramadan. Zaid (RA) was there, too, but also Hamzah (RA) was there in my dream. I know that Hamzah (RA) wasn't really there, because he was martyred at Uhud. So was this the Prophet in this dream? How can we know for sure?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related What did Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) look like? Praise be to Allah.What did Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) look like? We will quote below a number of hadiths which describe Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). If what you saw in your dream is in accordance with this, then you did indeed see the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), because he said: &quot;Whoever sees me in a dream has really seen me, because Shaytan cannot appear in my image.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5729) Rabi'ah ibn Abi 'Abd al-Rahman said: &quot;I heard Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) describing the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). He said: 'He was of average height, not too tall and not too short, with a pinkish colour, not very white and not dark, and his hair was neither very curly nor very straight. The Revelation came to him when he was forty years old, and he stayed in Makkah for ten years after the Revelation came, then in Madinah for ten years. When he died, there were no more than twenty white hairs on his head and in his beard.&quot; (Al-Bukhari, 3283) Al-Bara ibn 'Azib said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was broad shouldered and had thick hair coming down to his shoulders and earlobes. He was wearing red garments. I have never seen anything more beautiful than him.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, Kitab al-Fadail, Bab Sifat Sha'r al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), no. 2338) 'Ali said: &quot;He was neither tall nor short, and had large hands and feet. He had a large head and was big-boned, and the thin line of hair (starting from his chest and extending to the navel) was long. When he walked, he would lean forward, as if he was walking downhill. I have never seen anyone like him, before or since.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 3570, who said this is a sahih hasan hadith). Jabir ibn Samurah said: &quot;The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was dali' al-fam, ash-kal al-'ayn and manhus al-'aqib.&quot; Shu'bah said: &quot;I asked Malik, 'What is dal' al-fam?' He said: 'Wide-mouthed.' I asked, 'What is ash-kal al-'ayn?' He said, 'Big-eyed.' I asked, 'What is manhus al-'aqib?' He said, 'His heels were not fleshy.'&quot; (Sahih Muslim, Kitab al-Fadail, 2339) As for the sin which you committed in the house of your brothers, repent to Allah for this.

    <title>Doctor's Knowledge of the Fetus</title>
    <question>Is the doctors knowledge of the fetus in the uterus complete?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Imaam Abu Abdullaah Muhammad ibn Ismaaeel al-Bukhaari reported, in al-Jaami al-Saheeh, which is the soundest book after the Quraan: &quot;Ibraaheem ibn al-Mundhir told me that Man told us that Maalik told me, from Abdullaah ibn Deenaar from Ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), that the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: The keys of the Unknown are five, which no-one knows except Allaah: no-one knows what will happen tomorrow except Allaah; no-one knows what is in the wombs except Allaah; no-one knows when it will rain except Allaah; no-one knows in which land he will die; and no-one knows when the Hour will begin except Allaah.&quot; (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Tafseer al-Quraan, hadeeth no. 4328). He also reported it with the wording: &quot;The keys of the Unseen are five: Verily, Allah! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He send down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily Allaah is All-Knower, All-Aware (of things) [Luqmaan 31:34].&quot; (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Tafseer al-Quraan, Baab (wa indahu mafaatih al-ghaybi laa yalamu illaa huwa), hadeeth no. 4261). Allaah is the only One Who has knowledge of the Unseen, as He says (Interpretation of the meaning) : &quot;Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows the Unseen except Allaah . . .&quot; [al-Naml 27:65] The Unseen referred to in this aayah is the same as that described in Soorat Luqmaan (see quote in preceding paragraph). There is no doubt whatsoever that this hadeeth is saheeh. What has confused the questioner is the fact that doctors are able to know the gender of the foetus via x-rays and ultrasound scans, but we should note that this knowledge is vague and incomplete. They may make mistakes, as has happened on numerous occasions. Moreover, they can only perform these scans etc. after a certain number of weeks of pregnancy have passed, and not before. Even if they know whether the foetus is male or female, they do not know whether it will be miscarried or carried to term, whether it will be born alive or dead. They do not know the precise length of time that it will stay in its mothers womb. They have nothing but conjecture and uncertainties. They do not know how long this person will live, how he will behave or what his provision will be, or whether he will be of the people of Paradise or the people of Hell. Knowledge of what is in the wombs is not merely a matter of knowing whether the foetus is male or female; it is broader than that, and no-one can know it all except Allaah, as He says (Interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Allaah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs fall short or exceed. Everything with Him is in (due) proportion.&quot; [al-Rad 13:8] In his Tafseer of this aayah, Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &quot;Allaah is telling us here of His complete knowledge: nothing is hidden from Him and He knows fully what the females of every species carry in their wombs. He says (Interpretation of the meaning): (He) knows that which is in the wombs, i.e., He knows whether it is male or female, good or bad, destined for Paradise or doomed to Hell, whether its life will be long or short. Similarly He says (Interpretation of the meaning): He knows you well when He created you from the earth, and when you were foetuses in your mothers wombs [al-Najm 53:32] In the two Saheehs there is a report from Ibn Masood, who said: The Messenger of Allah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;The way that each of you is created is that he is gathered in your mothers womb for forty days and then for a similar length of time as a blood-clot and then for a similar length of time as a lump of flesh. Then an angel is sent and he breathes the spirit into him and is charged with four commands: to write down his provision, his life-span, his actions, and whether he will be wretched or happy.&quot; According to another hadeeth, the angel says: O Lord, male or female? Wretched or happy? How much provision? How long a life span? and he writes that.&quot; Al-Awfi said, from Ibn Abbaas: &quot;and by how much the wombs fall short&quot; refers to miscarriage, and or exceed means how how far beyond the normal time the pregnancy will last before a child is born, because some women carry a child for ten months and some for nine months; the length of pregnancy varies from woman to woman. This is what is referred to here. Al-Dahhaak said, from Ibn Abbaas, that this phrase referred to pregnancies longer or shorter than nine months.&quot; Every Muslim must believe in what the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) has told us, and not doubt a single word of it, because what the Prophet says is wahy (revelation) revealed to him by Allaah: &quot;By the star when it goes down, your companion (i.e., Muhammad) has neither gone astray nor has erred. Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. It is only an Inspiration [wahy] that is inspired.&quot; [al-Najm 53:1-4] Whoever doubts what the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said or doubts that it is wahy is a kaafir who has left Islam. The Muslim must believe that what the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said is absolutely true. This is shown in the hadeeth of Abdullaah ibn Amar, who said: &quot;I used to write down everything that I heard from the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him), because I wanted to memorize it. Quraysh told me not to do that and said: Are you writing everything down that you hear? The Messenger of Allaah is only a man who may speak when he is angry or happy. So I stopped writing things down, and I mentioned this to the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him). He pointed to his mouth and said: Write; by the One in Whose hand is my soul, nothing comes out of it (my mouth) but the truth.&quot; (Reported by Abu Dawud, may Allaah have mercy on him, in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Ilm, hadeeth no. 3161, see also Saheeh al-Jaami, no. 1196). We ask Allah to protect us from the whispers of Shaytaan and to give us strength of faith. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <question>Is setting a date to meet and read the entire Quraan for a deceased person and to pray for him, and doing this every year a bidah.?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. There is no indication in either the Quraan or the Sunnah that would prescribe the actions described in the question. Based on this fact, these actions are bidah (a reprehensible innovation) which is not permitted; we should avoid it and warn others not to do it. The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) used to say in his khutbahs (sermons): &quot;The truest of speech is the Book of Allaah, the best guidance is that of Muhammad and the worst of things are those which are newly invented. Every newly-invented thing is a bidah, every bidah is a going astray, and every going astray will end in the Fire of Hell.&quot; (Reported by al-Nisaai, may Allaah have mercy on him, in al-Sunan, Kitaab salaat al-eidayn, no. 1560). It is permissible to pray for the deceased, without arranging a formal gathering, and without setting a specific date for doing so. We ask Allaah to help us and you to do that which He loves and which will please Him. Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Taking the crescent as a symbol</title>
    <question>What is the symbolism behind the
   Muslim star and crescent? I did a keyword search of your site and searched my library's
   reference books and cannot find anything more than a reference to the flag of the Ottoman
   Empire. Thank you for your interest.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There is no basis in shareeah for taking the crescent or star as a symbol of the Muslims. This was not known at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or at the time of the Khulafa al-Raashidoon (the first four leaders of Islam after the death of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or during the time of the Umawis (Umayyad dynasty). It emerged some time after that, and historians differ as to when this symbol was first adopted and who was the first to adopt it. Some say it was the Persians, others say it was the Greeks, and that this symbol was somehow passed to the Muslims. (See Al-Taraateeb al-Idaariyah by al-Kittaani, 1/320). It was said that the reason why the Muslims adopted the crescent was that when they conquered some western countries, the churches there had crosses on top of them, the Muslims replaced the crosses with these crescents, and the practice spread in this way. Whatever the case, symbols and banners must be in accordance with the teachings of Islam, and as there is no evidence that this symbol is prescribed by Islam, it is better not to use it. Neither the crescent nor the star are symbols of the Muslims, even though some Muslims may use them as symbols. As regards what Muslims think about the moon and the stars, they believe that they are part of the creation of Allaah, and as such can neither benefit nor harm people, and they do not have any influence over events on earth. Allaah has created them for the benefit of mankind, an example of which is seen in the aayah or verse of the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage [al-Baqarah 2:189] [The commentator] Ibn Katheer said, explaining the phrase Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time: From them (the new moons) they may know the times for repaying loans, the iddah (waiting period) of their women [after being divorced or widowed] and the timing of their Hajj (pilgrimage) Allaah has made them signs to mark the times when Muslims should start to fast and break their fast [the beginning and end of Ramadaan], to count the iddah of their women and to know the times for repaying loans. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). [Another commentator] Al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on this aayah [verse]: This explains the wisdom behind the waxing and waning of the moon, which is to avoid any confusion in appointed dates, dealings, oaths, Hajj, iddah, fasting, breaking fasts, length of pregnancy, rentals and other matters that concern mankind. Similar to this aayah are others (interpretation of the meanings): And We have appointed the night and the day as two aayaat (signs). Then, We have made dark the sign of the night while We have made the sign of day illuminating, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning [al-Isra 17:12] It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the moon as a light and measured out its (their) stages, that you might know the number of years and the reckoning [Yoonus 10:5] Counting the new moons is easier than counting days. (See Tafseer al-Qurtubi). With regard to the stars, the scholars of Islam say that Allaah created these stars for three reasons: to adorn the heavens, to drive away the devils (shayaateen) and as signs for navigation. (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, Kitaab Bad al-Khalq), as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): It is He Who has set the stars for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea [al-Anaam 6:97] And indeed We have adorned the nearest heaven with lamps, and We have made such lamps (as) missiles to drive away the shayaateen (devils), and have prepared for them the torment of the blazing Fire.

    <title>When they need to write the Gregorian date</title>
    <question>Some of the offices of al-Muntada al-Islami are in countries which use the Gregorian calendar. We use the Hijri calendar, but this causes us problems when we deal with government departments which do not use the Hijri calendar, or when drawing up budgets, paying salaries and preparing financial reports for the appropriate departments in those countries.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with using both dates, so long as the Hijri date is written first, followed by the equivalent Gregorian date. The Hijri date is based on the lunar months, which are clear and can be readily observed by anyone who has eyes to see, but the Gregorian months do not have any clearly visible signs and can only be known through calculations. Hence the Islamic shareeah uses the Arabic months for the dates of fasting, Hajj, Itikaaf and so on. Beginning with the Hijri date is also a manifestation of the symbols and features of Islam among those who do not know them. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to approve of those who slander the religion in this slaughter-house, even if they pray, because slandering the religion is kufr which puts a person beyond the pale of Islam. As for those who do not pray, they should not be left to do this job if they deny that it is obligatory, or they persist in not praying, or if they do not pray even at home. It is not permissible to eat the meat slaughtered by these people, even if they call themselves Muslims and mention the name of Allaah when they slaughter the meat. You should not keep quiet about them if they are in a Muslim country where the laws of shareeah are applied. If you cannot get them thrown out from this kind of work, then you have to warn the Muslims against eating meat slaughtered by them. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Is it necessary    for every single Muslim to see the new moon of Ramadaan?</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on a person who does not fast according to the first sighting of the new moon of Ramadaan, but waits until he sees it for himself? Is their interpretation of hadeeth, Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it correct??</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.What is obligatory is to fast when the sighting of the moon is confirmed, even if it is seen by only one trustworthy Muslim, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) issued orders to fast when a Bedouin testified that he had seen the new moon. Interpreting the hadeeth Fast when you see it and stop fasting when you see it as meaning that no individual should fast until he sees the new moon for himself is incorrect, because the hadeeth is telling everyone to fast when the sighting is confirmed, even if only one trustworthy Muslim sees the new moon. (Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah, 10/94). Further evidence that the sighting of the new moon by one trustworthy, reliable Muslim is sufficient for fasting to be obligatory on all the people is the hadeeth of Ibn Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said: The people went out to sight the new moon and I told the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) that I had seen it, so he fasted and told the people to fast. (Reported by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, Kitaab al-Sawm, Baab fi Shahaadat al-Waahid ala ruyat hilaali Ramadaan). Some of those who follow bidah delay fasting until after all the other Muslims have started to fast, because of their misguided belief that fasting is not obligatory on a person until he sees the new moon for himself. The ahaadeeth refute this, and we would ask them moreover: what are those who are blind or who have poor eyesight supposed to do? It is as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind. [al-Hajj 22:46]. And Allaah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.</answer>

    <title>We should rely on    sighting of the moon, not on calculations</title>
    <question>As-salamo Alikum Wa Rahamtu Allah Wa Barakatoh
I pray that Allah grant your Tech. by his mercy. Still he in sha;a Allah got the reward of this valuable home page.
Please, visit the following web-site,
XXXX it is concerning Hilal sighting and calculation, they claimed that in XXXX they never sight the moon and every thing run according to astronomy calculations.
My question, Is this information is right or worng, and what is the real authentic way to decied the begining of Hajrii moneth?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Islam is easy and its rules apply to everyone, mankind and jinn alike, regardless of whether they are scholars or illiterate, settled or nomadic. So Allaah made it easy for them to know the times for the acts of worship, and made their beginning and end signs which everyone can know. He made the setting of the sun the sign for the beginning of Maghrib and the end of Asr, and He made the disappearance of the red glow in the sky the sign of the beginning of the time of Isha. He made the sighting of the moon after its disappearance at the end of the month the sign of the beginning of the new lunar month and the end of the previous month. He did not give us the task of knowing the beginning of the lunar month from something which is known to only a small number of people, namely astronomy and its calculations. Thus the texts of the Quraan and Sunnah make the actual sighting of the new moon the signal for the Muslims to start fasting Ramadaan; they stop fasting when they see the new moon of Shawwaal; the dates of Eid al-Adhaa and Yawm Arafaat are similarly determined. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):  So whoever among you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan), he must observe sawm (fast) that month [al-Baqarah 2:185] They ask you (O Muhammad) about the new moons. Say: these are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage [al-Baqarah 2:189] The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Fast when you see it [the new moon] and stop fasting when you see it, and if it is cloudy then complete the month with thirty days. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) made the beginning of the fast conditional upon the confirmed sighting of the new moon of Ramadaan, and the ending of the fast conditional upon the confirmed sighting of the new moon of Shawwaal; he did not connect this to calculations of the movements of stars or other heavenly bodies. This is how it was done at the time of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), during the rule of the Khulafa al-Raashidoon, at the time of the four imaams, and during the three centuries which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said were the best. Referring to calculations of the lunar months to start and end periods of worship, instead of actually sighting the new moon, is a bidah (reprehensible innovation) that has no good in it and has no basis in shareeah. The best of all is to follow the salaf in religious matters, and the worst of all is to follow newly-invented innovations in religion. May Allaah protect us and you and all the Muslims from tribulation, both obvious and hidden.</answer>

    <question>as-salaamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa
   barakatuhuplease inform we whether or not i must pay interest on loans i took out
   before coming to islam, or in my days of ignorance. i intend to pay off all of the
   principal ,of course, but i hate that i enter a state of war with Allah and His Messenger
   (SAW) because of fulfilling a haram contract that i entered while not knowing better. i
   would also hate to give muslims a bad name by not paying my debt conscientiously. can i
   pay of the principal and give a gift stipulating that i reject riba and that i am only
   giving this extra sum for another reason?may Allah subhanu wa ta'Ala reward you with the good.</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.If you are able to, then do not pay the interest, so that you will not be counted among those referred to in the hadeeth: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) cursed the one who consumes riba, the one who pays it, the one who writes it down and those who witness it, and said that all are equally sinful. (Reported by Muslim, 2995). All of them are cursed for their participation in this sin. In order for a Muslim to avoid giving a bad impression to the people from whom he took out the loan and who may be unaware of the fact that it is forbidden, if he does not want to pay the interest, he could explain to them the shari reason for this. If you have no choice and are forced to pay the interest, unwillingly, then your repentance should be sufficient, in sha Allaah. For more information, please see Questions # 824 and 2492.

    <title>Thinking about becoming Muslim so her Muslim boyfriend might marry her</title>
    <question>A very personal and difficult to explain
   question:
I have a boy-friend who is originally from XXX,
  so he is a muslim. He now lives in the XXX and I live inXXX. I am a christian.He has asked me to marry him and I have agreed. The problem is .... his family. They have arranged a future wife for him, but he does notwish to marry
   her. But out of respect for his father he will anyway, unles I become a muslim.Then he HOPES his father will agree to our marriage.Once I knew this, I asked him, what his family would do if they found out
   he intends to marry a European girl.He could not really answer that question. Now my question is: Do you have any idea how the family might react, and
   is it likely that the father would agree if I am a muslim?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is difficult to say what their reaction will be. Most parents want their children to marry in accordance with their wishes, and in most cases they will have chosen a wife for their son from their own country, whose customs and tradition are closer to those of the society in which they live. The idea of their son marrying a western woman may be very strange for them and difficult to accept, especially if they have heard about the widespread promiscuity in the West and the freedom with which Western women enter into relationships. They may also want their son to be near them, and they may be afraid that if he marries someone overseas they will only see him rarely. They may warn him about the consequences of raising his future children in a non-Islamic environment. On the other hand, they might agree if they hear that their son is going to marry a decent, upright Muslim girl, especially if their son is going to stay on and work in the West after completing his studies, and if they give any weight to their sons own wishes  which is a matter that differs from family to family. Whatever the case, you will not lose anything by entering Islam, whether you marry this man or not. If you become Muslim and marry this man, after you both repent from the forbidden relationship, then you will have got what you wanted. If this marriage is not destined for you, then maybe Allaah will send you another good, clean Muslim man whom you can marry and be happy with. The most important thing here is that you understand that striving to please Allaah by following His religion is more important than all other considerations. In any case, we hope that you will become Muslim and that your hopes will be realized in accordance with the laws of Allaah. Thank you for your trust and your question.</answer>

    <title>Is Marriage Compulsory in Islam?</title>
    <question>Is it obligatory for a woman to get married?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related When does marriage become obligatory? Status of marriage in Islam Benefits of marriage Praise be to Allah.When does marriage become obligatory? In response to your question, we will look briefly at what some of the Muslim jurists have written on this topic. In Mawahib al-Jaleel it was said: Marriage is obligatory for a woman who is unable to feed or clothe herself unless she gets married. In al-Sharh al-Kabir, concerning obligatory marriage it says: If a person fears that he may commit fornication, it (marriage) is obligatory on him. In Fath al-Wahhab, it says: For the woman who has (physical) desires, marriage is sunnah, just as it is for the one who needs maintenance and the one who fears being taken advantage of by immoral persons. In Mughni al-Muhtaj, it says: (Marriage) becomes wajib (obligatory) if a person fears fornication And it was said that it becomes obligatory if a person has made a vow (nadhr) to get married. Then concerning the ruling with regard to women: If she needs to get married, i.e., she has physical desires, or needs maintenance, or she is afraid that immoral people may take advantage of her it is preferable (mustahabb) for her to get married, because this will protect her religion and her chastity, and she can enjoy what her husband spends on her, and other advantages. Ibn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book al-Mughni: Our colleagues differed as to whether marriage is obligatory. The best-known opinion in our madhhab is that it is not obligatory, except when a person is afraid of committing a forbidden deed if he does not marry. In that case he should make himself chaste (i.e. get married). This is the opinion of the majority of fuqaha. When it comes to marriage, people are of three types, one of which is those who fear that they may commit forbidden deeds if they do not get married. It is obligatory for such people to get married, according to the majority of jurists, because it is obligatory for them to make themselves chaste and protect themselves from haram. In Subul al-Salam it says: Ibn Daqiq al-Eid said that some of the jurists said that marriage is obligatory for the one who fears sin or hardship (because of suppressing physical desires) and is able to marry and it is obligatory for the one who cannot avoid fornication unless he gets married. In Badai al-Sanai, it says: There is no dispute that marriage is an obligation when desire is strong. If a person has such a strong desire for women that he cannot be patient, and he can afford to pay the mahr (dowry) and support a wife, then if he does not get married, he is a sinner. From the above discussion, we can see a number of situations in which marriage is obligatory. You might ask: How can we imagine a woman fulfilling this obligation when usually it is the man who goes around knocking on doors looking for a partner? This is not the womans role. The answer is: what a woman can do to fulfill this command is not to refuse marriage when a suitable, compatible man comes with an offer of marriage. Status of marriage in Islam Muslim women and men need to understand the high status which marriage has in Islam, so that they will be more keen to marry. There follows a useful summary on this topic by al-Imam Ibn Qudamah al-Maqdisi (may Allah have mercy on him), from his book al-Mughni: The basis of the legislation of marriage is the Quran, Sunnah and ijma (consensus of the scholars). In the Quran, Allah says (interpretation of the meanings):  marry women of your choice, two or three, or four [al-Nisa 4:3] and And marry those among you who are single and (also marry) the salihun (pious, fit and capable ones) of your (male) slaves and maid-servants (female slaves) [al-Nur 24:32]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: O young men! Whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for this will lower his gaze and protect his chastity. Whoever cannot (get married), then let him fast, for fasting will be a protection for him.(Agreed upon). There are many other verses and reports like these. The Muslims agree that marriage is legislated. Ibn Masud said: If I only had ten days left to live, and I knew that I would die at the end of them, and I was able to get married, I would do so, for fear of fitnah (temptation). Ibn 'Abbas said to Said ibn Jubayr: Get married, for the best of this ummah are those who have more wives. Ibrahim ibn Maysarah said: Tawus said to me: Either you get married, or I will say to you what Umar said to Abul-Zawaid: There is nothing stopping you from getting married but either impotence or immorality! According to al-Mirwadhi, Ahmad said: Celibacy has nothing to do with Islam. Whoever calls you not to get married is calling you to something other than Islam. Benefits of marriage Then he said (may Allah have mercy on him): The benefits of marriage are many. They include: protecting ones religion and helping one to adhere to it; protecting and taking care of women; and producing offspring and increasing the ranks of the ummah, thus achieving the pride of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), etc. [Translators note: there is a hadith which indicates that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) will feel proud of the large numbers of his ummah in the Hereafter, so Muslims are encouraged to marry and have many children.] It should now be clear that the benefits of marriage are many. No wise Muslim woman would hesitate to get married, especially if an offer of marriage comes from a person who is strongly committed to Islam and is possessed of a good character and morals. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Can sihr (witchcraft, magic) kill?</title>
    <question>i would like information on majic (jadoo)
   what are the consequences and can people use it to kill people.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Yes, there is sihr that can kill. When discussing different forms of murder the scholars have mentioned that the person who kills another by means of a kind of sihr that usually kills should be executed (qisaas  retaliation), because he has killed by means of something that usually kills. Ibn Qudaamah said in al-Mughni (9/330): The sixth kind: if he killed him by means of a kind of sihr that usually kills, then he has to be executed, because he has killed by means of something that usually kills, like killing by use of a knife. If he killed by means of something that does not usually kill or something that sometimes kills and sometimes does not, then he has to pay diyah (blood-money), but qisaas is not required, because he intended to do harm, and it is akin to beating someone with a stick (which may or may not kill). The ruling concerning the saahir (practitioner of sihr) in al-Mawsooah al-Fiqhiyyah (24/267) says that in the case where he killed a person by means of his sihr the majority say that killing by means of sihr may be done deliberately, in which case qisaas is required. According to the Maalikis, evidence or a confession is required. According to the Shaafiis, if the person whom the practitioner of sihr killed was his equal , then qisaas is required if the killing was deliberate, which may be proven by a confession on the part of the saahir, such as his saying I killed him by means of my sihr, or I killed him with this type of thing, supported by the testimony of two reliable witnesses who have practised sihr in the past but have now repented, who can confirm that this kind of sihr usually kills. If it is a type that does not usually kill, then the matter is more akin to manslaughter. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Expiation for one who had intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramadan</title>
    <question>My question is complex. First, during the first Ramadan that my wife and I were married, we did something that we are ashamed of and have sincerely repented for; and that is have intercourse while fasting. Unfortunately, this occured 2 or 3 times.
I have come to know that the correct action for this is to: first free a slave or second, fast for 60 days continuously. The first option of freeing a slave is not possible, so my question is about fasting.
I could fast for sixty days but since it is continuous, I believe that I would not be able to provide for my family (fasting weakens me, and my job is a physical one, without energy, It becomes unbelievably difficult). It is hard enough to make it through Ramadan and earn enough money ( with Allah's will) to provide for my family. What options are left to me. I am aware of the hadith were a poor man came to the prophet (pbuh) and he was given the options free a slave, fast, and he couldn't do either, so he was given dates to give to the poorest family, which was his, so he took them to his family. How does this apply to me? I alhamdulilah, am not rich, but am not poor either (mostly pay check to pay check) - my wife and I feel tremendous guilt about this. Please help! Also, if one is to fast is that 60 days for each time one had intercourse during Ramadans fast?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Our advice is that you should try to fast the two consecutive months during cold or temperate days when the days will be shorter and it will be less difficult for you, or during the annual leave which your employer gives you, and other opportunities which you can make use of for this purpose. If you really and truly cannot fast, then it is permissible for you to feed sixty poor persons. You could give them food in stages  according to what you are able to do  until you have fed the complete number. Your wife also has to make a similar expiation if she was a willing partner in the act of intercourse during the day in Ramadan. If the number of times that intercourse took place happened on different days, then you have to offer expiation for each day on which the sanctity of the sacred month was broken. The author of Kifaayat al-Taalib said: The number of expiations corresponds to the number of days, not to the number of times the act was repeated on one day before the payment of any expiation. This is by consensus (of the scholars). It was said in Haashiyat al-Dasooqi: It is not counted by the number of times a person ate or had intercourse in one day. The author of Mughni al-Muhtaaj said: Expiation is counted by the number of misdeeds (whoever had intercourse on two different days must pay expiation twice) because each day is a separate, independent act of worship, so the expiation for both cannot be combined If the act of intercourse happened several times in one day, the separate acts are not counted [i.e. one expiation is sufficient]. Allaah burdens not any person, but that which he can bear. The hadeeth to which you refer in your question was narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: Whilst we were sitting with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), a man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allaah, I am doomed! He said, What happened to you? He said: I had intercourse with my wife whilst I was fasting. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) asked: Could you find a slave you could set free? He said, No. He asked, Are you able to fast for two consecutive months? He said, No. He asked, Can you feed sixty poor persons? He said, No. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) fell silent. Whilst we were (sitting) like that, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was brought a container of dates. He said, Where is the one who was asking? The man said, I (am here). He said, Take these and give them in charity. The man said, Who is poorer than I, O Messenger of Allaah? There is no household between the two lava fields (i.e., in Madeenah) that is poorer than my household. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) smiled until his back teeth could be seen, then he said: Feed it to your family. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath, 1936). According to a report narrated by Ahmad from Aaishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), whilst the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sitting in the shade of the fortress of Hassaan, a man came to him and said, I have been burnt, O Messenger of Allaah! He asked, What is wrong with you? He said, I had intercourse with my wife whilst I was fasting. She [Aaishah] said: that was in Ramadaan. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to him, Sit down, so he sat down at the back of the gathering. Then a man came with a donkey on whose back was a basket of dates, and said: This is my sadaqah (charity) O Messenger of Allaah. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, Where is the burnt one who just came? He said: Here I am, O Messenger of Allaah. He said: Take this and give it in charity. He said, Where should it go except to me and my family, O Messenger of Allaah? By Him Who sent you with the truth, I cannot find anything for me and my family. He said: Take it. So he took it. (al-Musnad 6/276). We ask Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, to forgive us our sins and transgressions and to accept our repentance, for He is the Acceptor of Repentance, the Most Merciful.</answer>

    <title>What Are the Forbidden Names in Islam?</title>
    <question>Are there any names which it is forbidden to use? If so, what are they?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Forbidden names Disliked names in Islam Praise be to Allah.Forbidden names Yes, there are names which we are forbidden to use, examples of which are as follows: Names which belong only to Allah It is forbidden to use any name which belongs only to Allah , such as al-Khaliq (the Creator) and al-Quddus (the Most Holy), or names which do not befit any except Allah, such as Malik al-Muluk (King of Kings). This is the consensus of the fuqaha. Ibn al-Qayyim said that names which belong only to Allah include : al-Ahad (the One), al-Samad (the Eternal), al-Khaliq (the Creator), al-Razzaq (the Provider), al-Jabbar (the Compeller), al-Mutakabbir (the Majestic), al-Awwal (the First), al-Akhir (the Last), al-Batin (the Hidden) and Allam al-Ghuyub (the Knower of the Unseen). (Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 98) The evidence that it is forbidden to call anyone by a name which belongs only to Allah, such as Malik al-Muluk (king of kings), may be seen for example in the hadith narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him); in the version narrated by al-Bukhari, he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The most despised name with Allah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man called Malik al-Muluk. According to Muslim, he said, The man who will be most deserving of Allahs anger and most evil on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who was called Malik al-Amlak. There is no King except Allah. As regards using names that may be used for Allah or for others, it is permissible to use these names, such as Ali (High), Rashid (Guide) and Badi (Innovator or Originator). Ibn Abidin said: It seems to be the case that they are permitted, even if the definite article al is used. Al-Hasqafi said: What (these names) mean concerning us (human beings) is different from their meanings concerning Allah, may He be exalted. Names which befit no one except the Prophet It is forbidden to use names which befit no one except the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), such as Sayyid Walad Adam (master of the sons of Adam), Sayyid al-Nas (master of mankind), Sayyid al-Kull (master of all), because these names, as the Hanbalis said, befit no one except him, (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Names which imply enslavement to anything besides Allah It is forbidden to use any name which implies enslavement to anything besides Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, such as Abd al-Uzza (slave of al-Uzza a pagan goddess), Abd al-Kabah (slave of the Kabah), Abd al-Dar (slave of the House), Abd Ali (slave of Ali), Abd al-Husayn (slave of Husayn), etc. It was stated in Hashiyat Ibn Abidin that one should not be called Abd Fulan (slave of so-and-so). It says in Kashshaf al-Qina: They (the scholars) agreed that every name which implies enslavement to anything other than Allah is forbidden, such as Abd al-Uzza, Abd Amr, Abd Ali, Abd al-Kabah, and any other similar names, such as Abd al-Nabi (slave of the Prophet), Abd al-Husayn, Abd al-Masih (slave of the Messiah). (Hashiyat Ibn Abidin, 5/268;Mughni al-Muhtaj, 4/295; Tuhfat al-Muhtaj, 10/373; Kashshaf al-Qina, 3/27; Tuhfat al-Mawdud, p. 90) The evidence that it is forbidden to use any name which implies enslavement to anything other than Allah may be seen in the report of Ibn Abi Shaybah from Yazid ibn al-Miqdam ibn Shurayh, from his father, from his grandfather Hani ibn Yazid, may Allah be pleased with him, who said: A delegation came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and he heard them calling someone Abd al-Hajar (slave of the stone). He asked him, What is your name? and he said, Abd al-Hajar. He said, No, you are Abd-Allah (the slave of Allah). (Al-Mawsuah al-Fiqhiyyah, 11/335) Using names of idols Using the names of idols that are worshipped instead of Allah. Names of devils It is forbidden to use the names of devils (shayatin), such as Khanzab and Iblis. It was reported that the Sunnah is to change names such as these. Disliked names in Islam Names that are makruh (disliked) may be categorized as follows: Names that have bad or distasteful meanings It is makruh to use names that have bad or distasteful meanings, or which sound odd, which would cause others to mock a person or would cause him embarrassment, in addition to being contrary to the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who taught us to choose good names. Names whose meanings are too soft and provocative or sexy It is makruh to use names whose meanings are too soft and provocative or sexy, which is a widespread problem in the naming of girls. Naming someone after promiscuous actors and singers It is makruh to deliberately name someone after promiscuous actors and singers who star in worthless entertainment shows. One of the signs of empty-headedness and lack of pride in one's faith is the fact that after a show starring immoral women, people will compete with one another in naming their newborns after these women. Anyone who checks the names registered at the time of one of these shows will see that this is a fact. And our complaining is to Allah. Names that convey any sense of sin It is makruh to use names that convey any sense of sin and disobedience to Allah. Foreign names that belong only to the unbelievers It is makruh to use foreign names that belong only to the unbelievers. The proud Muslim who is content with his religion will avoid this and not come anywhere near it. The temptation to use these names is very strong in our time, and a Muslim might pick up any name from Europe and America. This is the worst type of sin and a sign of humiliation and defeat. If this imitation of the unbelievers and using their names is merely the matter of whims and stupidity, it is nevertheless a major sin; if it is done because one actually believes these names are better than Muslim names, then this is a devastating blow to the foundation of faith. In either case, the person who has done this must hasten to repent, and changing the name is a condition of repentance. Names of Pharaohs or other tyrants It is makruh to use the names of Pharaohs or other tyrants. Names that have any undesirable meaning It is makruh to use names that have any undesirable meaning. Naming people after animals It is makruh to name people after animals that are known for their bad qualities. When the Arabs called their children by such names, it was because of good qualities that they noticed in them, and this was the desired meaning. So when they used the name Kalb (dog), it was because of the dogs alertness and ability to work hard; when they used the name Himar (donkey), it was because of the donkeys patience and forbearance, and so on This refutes the false arguments of the Shuubiyyah against the Arabs, as was explained by Ibn Durayd, Ibn Faris, and others. Names which are composed of any word added to such words as al-Din or Islam It is makruh to use any name which is composed of any word added to such words as al-Din (the Religion) or Islam, such as Nur al-Din/Nuruddin (Light of the Religion), Diya al-Din/Ziauddin (Brightness of the Religion), Sayf al-Islam (Sword of Islam), Nur al-Islam (Light of Islam), etc. This is because of the great status attached to these words, al-Din and Islam. Adding words to them to form names is an exaggeration which borders on lying, which is why some scholars said that this is haram, and the majority say that it is makruh, because it gives an incorrect impression which should not be given. The way this practice started was that these were titles which were added to peoples names, then people started to use them as names. Names of this sort may be forbidden for two reasons. In a name such as Shihab al-Din, for example, the word Shihab means a flame, which comes from fire, then this is added to the word al-Din (which is inappropriate). This can lead to the use of strange names, as in Indonesia, where people use names such as Dhahab al-Din (gold of the Religion) and Mas al-Din (diamond of the Religion)! Imam al-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him), used to dislike being called by his nickname Muhiy al-Din, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) used to dislike being called by his nickname Taqiy al-Din, and he said, But my family gave me this nickname, so I am known by it. Names which include the word al-Rasul Names which include the word al-Rasul (the Messenger) are also makruh. Names of angels Some of the scholars regarded using the names of angels (peace be upon them) as makruh. Giving angels names to women is clearly haram, because it implies imitation of the mushrikin, who thought that the angels were the daughters of Allah, Exalted be He above what they say! Names of Surahs of the Quran Some of the scholars thought that it was makruh to give people the names of Surahs of the Quran, such as Ta-Ha, Ya-Sin, Ha-Mim. (The popular notion that Ya-Sin and Ta-Ha are names of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is not correct).

    <title>Combining two intentions in one fast  the issue of overlapping acts of worship</title>
    <question>Is it possible to combine the intention of fasting the three days in each month with the intention to fast the Day of Arafaah? Will we receive two rewards?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Combining acts of worship is of two types: One type is not correct, which is in the case of acts of worship which are independent or are part of another. In these cases, intentions cannot be combined. For example, if a man misses the Sunnah of Fajr, and the sun comes up and the time for Salaat al-Duhaa comes, the Sunnah of Fajr cannot take the place of Salaat al-Duhaa, or vice-versa. They cannot be combined, because the Sunnah of Fajr is independent, and Salaat al-Duhaa is independent, and neither of them can take the place of the other. The same applies if an act is connected to the one that comes before it  they cannot be combined. So if a man says, I want to have the intention of praying both fard and sunnah when I pray Fajr, we would tell him that this is not correct, because the Sunnah (of Fajr) is directly connected to the Fard, and cannot take its place. The second type is where what is intended is not a specific act of worship. In this case, intentions may be combined. For example: a man enters the mosque where the people are praying Salaat al-Fajr. It is known that when a man enters the mosque, he should not sit down until he prays two rakahs, so if he joins the imaam in that prayer, this is good enough. Why? Because the point is that he should pray two rakahs when he enters the mosque. Similarly, if a man enters the mosque at the time of Salaat al-Duhaa and prays two rakahs with the intention of praying Salaat al-Duhaa, he does not have to pray Tahiyyat al-Masjid as well, but if he has the intention of both, that is better. This is the guideline for combining acts of worship. In the case of fasting, fasting the Day of Arafaah, for example, means that when this day comes you will be fasting, whether you intended it as one of the three days which you fast every month or as the Day of Arafaah. But if you intended it as the Day of Arafaah, it will not count as one of the three days; but if you intended it as one of the three days, that is good enough and will count as the Day of Arafaah too. If you intended both, that is preferable.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on objects    made from animal skins</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on using different kinds of animal skins, whether they come from animals whose meat we can eat or those whose meat we cannot eat, whether they are tanned or not tanned?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The skins of animals that become halaal through proper slaughter are pure (taahir), because they become good through the process of proper slaughter, such as the skins of camels, cattle, sheep, gazelles, rabbits and so on, whether they are tanned or not tanned. As for the skins of animals whose meat we cannot eat, such as dogs, wolves, lions, elephants and the like, it is impure (naajis), whether it is slaughtered or it dies or is killed, because even if it is slaughtered it does not become halaal and cannot be good, so it is naajis, whether it is tanned or not tanned. This is according to the most correct opinion, because the most correct opinion is that impure skins cannot be made pure through tanning if they come from animals which we are not permitted to slaughter for food. As for the skins of animals which have died before they could be slaughtered properly, if these are tanned then they become pure, but before they are tanned they are impure. So now animal skins may be divided into three types: The first type: those which are pure whether they are tanned or not, which are the skins of animals that may be eaten if they are slaughtered correctly. The second type: skins which cannot be pure either before or after tanning, because they are impure. These are the skins of animals whose meat we cannot eat, like pigs. The third type: skins which become pure after tanning, but are not pure before before tanning. These are the skins of animals whose meat may be eaten if they are slaughtered properly but not if they die otherwise.</answer>

    <title>What should a man say when he enters upon his bride?</title>
    <question>What is the Sunnah when entering upon ones wife on the wedding night? Many people mistakenly think that he should read Soorat al-Baqarah and pray, and this custom is widespread nowadays.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.When a man enters upon his wife for the first time, he should take her forelock in his hand and say: Allaahumma innee asaluka khayrahaa wa khayra ma jabaltahaa alayh, wa aoodhu bika min sharrihaa wa sharri ma jabaltahaa alayh (O Allaah, I ask You for the goodness within her and the goodness that You have made her inclined towards, and I take refuge with You from the evil within her and the evil that You have made her inclined towards). (Reported by Abu Dawood, no. 2160; Ibn Maajah, no. 1918), But if he fears that the woman may get upset if he takes hold of her forelock and recites this duaa, then he can take hold of her forelock as if he is going to kiss her, and recite this duaa to himself under his breath, without letting her hear him, so that she will not be upset. If she is a woman who has knowledge, she will know that this is prescribed by Islam and that there is nothing wrong with him doing and saying this in such a way that she can hear it. As for praying two rakahs when he enters the room where his wife is, it was reported that some of the salaf did this, so if the man does this it is good, and if he does not do it, there is nothing wrong with that. As for reciting al-Baqarah and other soorahs, I know of no basis for doing this.</answer>

    <title>Merits of Zamzam Water</title>
    <question>Does Zamzam water have any significance? Is there any hadith to say it is used for cures, etc. and or keep niyyah and drink it for a purpose?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related What is Zamzam? Virtues of drinking from the water of Zamzam How to drink Zamzam water Can you take Zamzam water back to your country? Praise be to Allah.What is Zamzam? Zamzam is the name of a famous well in al-Masjid al-Haram [the Sacred Mosque in Makkah], which is thirty-eight cubits away from the Ka`bah. It is the well of Ismail, the son of Ibrahim (peace and blessings of Allah be upon them both), from which Allah quenched the thirst of Ismail when he was an infant. His mother looked for water for him, but could not find any. She climbed to the top of al-Safa, praying to Allah to help her and give her water for Ismail, then she climbed to the top of al-Marwah and did the same. Allah sent Jibril, and he struck the earth with his heels, and water appeared. Virtues of drinking from the water of Zamzam The scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) agreed that it is recommended for pilgrims on Hajj and `Umrah in particular, and for all Muslims in general, to drink Zamzam water, because of the authentic hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) is reported to have drunk the water of Zamzam . (Al-Bukhari, 3/492) According to the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said concerning the water of Zamzam, It is a blessing, and it is food that satisfies. (Reported by Muslim, 4/1922). Al-Tayaalisi (61) added, in a version that he narrated: and a cure for the sick. I.e., drinking the water of Zamzam means that a person does not need to eat, and it will cure his sickness  but this is when he drinks it with faith and sincerity, as proven in the hadith of Abu Dharr al-Ghifari who stayed in Makkah for a month without any nourishment except Zamzam water. Al-`Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The people used to compete over Zamzam during the time of Jahiliyyah. People who had children used to bring them and give them to drink, and this was their early-morning victuals. We used to used to think that it was a help for people who had children. Al-'Abbas said: During the Jahiliyyah, Zamzam was known as Shabaah (satisfaction). Al-Allamah al-Abbi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: (The water) is for whatever purpose it is drunk for, and Allah made it food and drink for Ismail and his mother Hajar . Ibn al-Mubarak entered Zamzam and said, O Allah, Ibn al-Muammal told me, from Abul-Zubayr from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for, so, O Allah, I am drinking it (to quench) my thirst on the Day of Resurrection. The two angels washed the heart of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was a child, after they had taken it out, then they put it back. Al-Hafiz al-'Iraqi (may Allah have mercy on him) said: The reason why the Prophets chest was washed with Zamzam water was to make him stronger so that he could see the kingdom of heaven and earth, and Paradise and Hell, because one of the special qualities of Zamzam is that it strengthens the heart and calms the soul. The report about the chest of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) being washed with the water of Zamzam is proven in the hadith of Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with him), who reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: My roof was opened when I was in Makkah, and Jibril (peace be upon him) came down and opened my chest, then he washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a gold basin full of wisdom and faith, poured it into my chest, and closed it up again. Then he took me by the hand and ascended with me into the first heaven. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 3/429) How to drink Zamzam water It is sunnah to drink ones fill of Zamzam water and to quench ones thirst. The jurists have mentioned the etiquette that is recommended when drinking Zamzam water, such as facing the Ka`bah , saying Bismillah, pausing to take a breath three times, drinking ones fill, praising Allah after one finishes, and sitting whilst drinking it, as one should do when drinking other kinds of drinks. As regards the hadith of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him), who said, I gave the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) Zamzam water to drink whilst he was standing, (reported by al-Bukhari, 3/492), it is taken to mean that it is permissible to drink whilst standing, and the disapproval of doing so is understood to mean that it is disliked. The scholars also recommended that the person who drinks Zamzam water should sprinkle some of it on his head, face and chest, make lots of du`a when drinking it, and to drink it for a purpose that will benefit him in this world or the next, because of the hadith in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The water of Zamzam is for whatever purpose it is drunk for. (Reported by Ibn Majah, 2/1018; see Al-Maqasid al-Hasanah by al-Sakhawi, p. 359) When Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) drank from the water of Zamzam, he said: O Allah, I ask you for beneficial knowledge, plentiful provision and healing from every disease. Al-Daynuri reported that al-Humaydi said: We were with Sufyan ibn Uyaynah, and he told us the hadith about the water of Zamzam being drunk for whatever purpose it is drunk for. A man got up and left the gathering, then he came back and said, O Abu Muhammad, is the hadith which you told us about the water of Zamzam sahih? He said, Yes. The man said, Just now I drank a bucket of Zamzam so that you would tell me one hundred hadiths. Sufyan said, Sit down, so he sat down and he told him one hundred hadiths. Can you take Zamzam water back to your country? Some jurists recommended that people should take some Zamzam water back with them to their countries, because it is a cure for those who seek healing. `Aishah reported that she took Zamzam water home with her in bottles, and said, The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) took some of it away with him, and he used to pour it on the sick and give it to them to drink. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 4/37) The jurists agreed that it is permissible to use Zamzam water to purify oneself , but they advised that it should not be used for any inappropriate purposes such as removing impurity and so on. Al-Allamah al-Bahuti (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his book Kashshaf al-Qina: Only this (using Zamzam water to remove najasah) is considered to be makruh, out of respect, but it is not makruh to use it to purify oneself, because Ali said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) departed (from Muzdalifah) and called for a bucket of Zamzam water. He drank from it, then did wudu. (Reported by Abd-Allah ibn Ahmad with a sahih isnad). (See Nayl al-Awtar, Kitab al-Taharah, Bab Tahuriyyat al-Bahr). Al-Hafiz al-Sakhawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in Al-Maqasid al-Hasanah: Some people said that the virtue (of Zamzam water) remains only so long as it is in its place (of origin), and that when it is taken away, it changes. This is an idea that has no basis. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wrote to Suhayl ibn `Amr: If my letter reaches you at night, do not wait until morning, and if it reaches you during the day, do not wait until evening, to send me some Zamzam water. He sent him two containers full, and at that time he was in Madinah, before the Conquest of Makkah. This hadith is hasan because of corroborating evidence. `Aishah also used to take Zamzam water away with her, and she reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to do this; he used to carry it in small vessels and buckets, and pour it onto the sick and give it to them to drink. Whenever a guest visited Ibn `Abbas he would honour him by giving him Zamzam to drink. `Ata was asked about taking Zamzam water away, and he said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), al-Hasan and al-Husayn all took it away with them. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Virtues of the Ten Days of Dhul Hijjah</title>
    <question>How do the first ten days of the Month of Dhul Hijjah differ from other days of the year?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Benefits of seasons of worship Virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah Reasons behind the virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah Things to avoid in Dhul Hijjah What to do in Dhul Hijjah Praise be to Allah.Benefits of seasons of worship Praise be to Allah Who has created time and has made some times better than others, some months and days and nights better than others, when rewards are multiplied many times, as a mercy towards His slaves. This encourages them to do more righteous deeds and makes them more eager to worship Him, so that the Muslim renews his efforts to gain a greater share of reward, prepare himself for death and supply himself in readiness for the Day of Judgement. This season of worship brings many benefits, such as the opportunity to correct ones faults and make up for any shortcomings or anything that one might have missed. Every one of these special occasions involves some kind of worship through which the slaves may draw closer to Allah, and some kind of blessing through which Allah bestows His favour and mercy upon whomsoever He will. The happy person is the one who makes the most of these special months, days and hours and draws nearer to his Lord during these times through acts of worship; he will most likely be touched by the blessing of Allah and will feel the joy of knowing that he is safe from the flames of Hell. (Ibn Rajab, al-Lataif, p.8) The Muslim must understand the value of his life, increase his worship of Allah and persist in doing good deeds until the moment of death. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty.&quot; [al-Hijr 15:99] The commentators said: &quot;The certainty means death.&quot; Virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah Among the special seasons of worship are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah , which Allah has preferred over all the other days of the year. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;There are no days in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these ten days.&quot; The people asked, &quot;Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?&quot; He said, &quot;Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhari, 2/457). Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;There is no deed more precious in the sight of Allah, nor greater in reward, than a good deed done during the ten days of Sacrifice .&quot; He was asked, &quot;Not even jihad for the sake of Allah?&quot; He said, &quot;Not even jihad for the sake of Allah, except in the case of a man who went out to fight giving himself and his wealth up for the cause, and came back with nothing.&quot; (Reported by al-Darimi, 1/357; its isnad is hasan as stated in al-Irwa, 3/398). These texts and others indicate that these ten days are better than all the other days of the year, with no exceptions, not even the last ten days of Ramadan. But the last ten nights of Ramadan are better, because they include Laylat al-Qadr (&quot;the Night of Decree&quot;), which is better than a thousand months. Thus the various reports may be reconciled. (See Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/412). Reasons behind the virtues of the first ten days of Dhul Hijjah You should know, my brother in Islam, that the virtue of these ten days is based on many things: Allah swears an oath by them, and swearing an oath by something is indicative of its importance and great benefit. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;By the dawn; by the ten nights&quot; [al-Fajr 89:1-2]. Ibn 'Abbas, Ibn al-Zubayr, Mujahid and others of the earlier and later generations said that this refers to the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. Ibn Kathir said: &quot;This is the correct opinion.&quot; (Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 8/413) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) testified that these are the best days of this world, as we have already quoted above from sahih ahadith. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) encouraged people to do righteous deeds because of the virtue of this season for people throughout the world, and also because of the virtue of the place - for the Hujjaj (pilgrims) to the Sacred House of Allah. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) commanded us to recite a lot of Tasbih (&quot;Subhan-Allah&quot;), Tahmid (&quot;Al-hamdu Lillah&quot;) and Takbir (&quot;Allahu akbar&quot;) during this time. Abdullah ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;There are no days greater in the sight of Allah and in which righteous deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so during this time recite a great deal of Tahlil (&quot;La ilaha ill-Allah&quot;), Takbir and Tahmid.&quot; (Reported by Ahmad, 7/224; Ahmad Shakir stated that it is sahih). These ten days include Yawm Arafah (the Day of Arafah ), on which Allah perfected His Religion. Fasting on this day will expiate for the sins of two years. These days also include Yawm al-Nahar (the Day of Sacrifice ), the greatest day of the entire year and the greatest day of Hajj , which combines acts of worship in a way unlike any other day. These ten days include the days of sacrifice and of Hajj. Things to avoid in Dhul Hijjah Question: What must the Muslim avoid during these ten days if he wants to offer a sacrifice? The Sunnah indicates that the one who wants to offer a sacrifice must stop cutting his hair and nails and removing anything from his skin, from the beginning of the ten days until after he has offered his sacrifice, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: &quot;When you see the new moon of Dhul-Hijjah, if any one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, then he should stop cutting his hair and nails until he has offered his sacrifice.&quot; According to another report he said: &quot;He should not remove (literally, touch) anything from his hair or skin.&quot; (reported by Muslim with four isnads, 13/146) The Prophets instruction here makes one thing obligatory and his prohibition makes another haram, according to the soundest opinion, because these commands and prohibitions are unconditional and unavoidable. However, if a person does any of these things deliberately, he must seek Allahs forgiveness but is not required to offer (an extra) sacrifice in expiation; his sacrifice will be acceptable. Whoever needs to remove some hair, nails, etc. because it is harming him, such as having a broken nail or a wound in a site where there is hair, should do so, and there is nothing wrong with that. The state of ihram is so important that it is permitted to cut ones hair if leaving it will cause harm. There is nothing wrong with men or women washing their heads during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) only forbade cutting the hair, not washing it. The wisdom behind this prohibition of the one who wants to offer a sacrifice from cutting his hair etc., is so that he may resemble those in ihram in some aspects of the rites performed, and so that he may draw closer to Allah by offering the sacrifice. So he leaves his hair and nails alone until the time when he has offered his sacrifice, in the hope that Allah will save him in his entirety from the Fire. And Allah knows best. If a person has cut his hair or nails during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah because he was not planning to offer a sacrifice, then he decides later, during the ten days, to offer a sacrifice, then he must refrain from cutting his hair and nails from the moment he makes this decision. Some women may delegate their brothers or sons to make the sacrifice on their behalf, then cut their hair during these ten days. This is not correct, because the ruling applies to the one who is offering the sacrifice, whether or not he (or she) delegates someone else to carry out the actual deed. The prohibition does not apply to the person delegated, only to the person who is making the sacrifice, as is indicated in the hadith. The person who is sacrificing on behalf of someone else, for whatever reason, does not have to adhere to this prohibition. This prohibition appears to apply only to the one who is offering the sacrifice, not to his wife and children, unless any of them is offering a sacrifice in his or her own right, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to sacrifice &quot;on behalf of the family of Muhammad,&quot; but there are no reports that say he forbade them to cut their hair or nails at that time. If a person was planning to offer a sacrifice, then he decides to go and perform Hajj, he should not cut his hair or nails if he wants to enter ihram, because the Sunnah is only to cut hair and nails when necessary. But if he is performing Tamattu [whereby he performs Umrah, comes out of ihram and enters ihram anew for Hajj], he should trim his hair at the end of his Umrah because this is part of the ritual. The things that are described above as being prohibited for the person who is planning to offer a sacrifice are reported in the hadith quoted above; the person is not forbidden to wear perfume, have marital relations, wear sewn garments, etc. What to do in Dhul Hijjah Concerning the types of worship to be performed during these ten days, one must understand that these days are a great blessing from Allah to His slave, which is appreciated properly by the actively righteous. It is the Muslims duty to appreciate this blessing and make the most of the opportunity, by devoting these ten days to paying more attention to striving hard in worship. Among His blessings to His slaves, Allah has given us many ways in which to do good and worship Him, so that the Muslim may be constantly active and consistent in his worship of his Lord. Among the good deeds which the Muslim should strive to do during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah are: 1.Fasting. It is Sunnah to fast on the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah , because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) urged us to do good deeds during this time, and fasting is one of the best of deeds. Allah has chosen fasting for Himself, as is stated in the hadith qudsi: &quot;Allah says: All the deeds of the son of Adam are for him, except for fasting, which is for Me and I am the One Who will reward him for it.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhari, 1805). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah. It was narrated from Hunaydah ibn Khalid from his wife, that one of the wives of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to fast on the first nine days of Dhul-Hijjah and the day of Ashura, and three days each month, the first Monday of the month and two Thursdays. Narrated by al-Nasai, 4/205 and by Abu Dawud; classed as sahih by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud, 2/462. 2. Takbir . It is Sunnah to say Takbir (&quot;Allahu akbar&quot;), Tahmid (&quot;Al-hamdu Lillah&quot;), Tahlil (&quot;La ilaha ill-Allah&quot;) and Tasbih (&quot;Subhan Allah&quot;) during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, and to say it loudly in the mosque, the home, the street and every place where it is permitted to remember Allah and mention His name out loud, as an act of worship and as a proclamation of the greatness of Allah, may He be exalted. Men should recite these phrases out loud, and women should recite them quietly. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;That they might witness things that are of benefit to them (i.e., reward of Hajj in the Hereafter, and also some worldly gain from trade, etc.), and mention the name of Allah on appointed days, over the beast of cattle that He has provided for them (for sacrifice)...&quot; [al-Hajj 22:28] The majority of scholars agree that the &quot;appointed days&quot; are the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, because of the words of Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father): &quot;The appointed days are the first ten days (of Dhul-Hijjah).&quot; The Takbir may include the words &quot;Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar, la ilaha ill-Allah; wa Allahu akbar wa Lillaahil-hamd (Allah is Most Great, Allah is Most Great, there is no god but Allah; Allah is Most Great and to Allah be praise),&quot; as well as other phrases. Takbir at this time is an aspect of the Sunnah that has been forgotten, especially during the early part of this period, so much so that one hardly ever hears Takbir, except from a few people. This Takbir should be pronounced loudly, in order to revive the Sunnah and as a reminder to the negligent. There is sound evidence that Ibn Umar and Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with them) used to go out in the marketplace during the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, reciting Takbir, and the people would recite Takbir when they heard them. The idea behind reminding the people to recite Takbir is that each one should recite it individually, not in unison, as there is no basis in Shariah for doing this. Reviving aspects of the Sunnah that have been virtually forgotten is a deed that will bring an immense reward, as is indicated by the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): &quot;Whoever revives an aspect of my Sunnah that is forgotten after my death, he will have a reward equivalent to that of the people who follow him, without it detracting in the least from their reward.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 7/443; this is a hasan hadith because of corroborating asanid). 3.Performing Hajj and Umrah. One of the best deeds that one can do during these ten days is to perform Hajj to the Sacred House of Allah. The one whom Allah helps to go on Hajj to His House and to perform all the rituals properly is included in the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him): &quot;An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise.&quot; 4.Doing more good deeds in general, because good deeds are beloved by Allah and will bring a great reward from Him. Whoever is not able to go to Hajj should occupy himself at this blessed time by worshipping Allah, praying (salah), reading Quran, remembering Allah, making supplication (dua), giving charity, honouring his parents, upholding the ties of kinship, enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and other good deeds and acts of worship. 5.Sacrifice. One of the good deeds that will bring a person closer to Allah during these ten days is offering a sacrifice, by choosing a high-quality animal and fattening it, and spending money for the sake of Allah. (more information to follow, in sha Allah). 6.Sincere repentance . One of the most important things to do during these ten days is to repent sincerely to Allah and to give up all kinds of disobedience and sin. Repentance means coming back to Allah and foregoing all the deeds, open and secret, that He dislikes, out of regret for what has passed, giving it up immediately and being determined never to return to it, but to adhere firmly to the Truth by doing what Allah loves. If a Muslim commits a sin, he must hasten to repent at once, without delay, firstly because he does not know when he will die, and secondly because one evil deed leads to another. Repentance at special times is very important because in most cases peoples thoughts turn towards worship at these times, and they are keen to do good, which leads to them recognizing their sins and feeling regret for the past. Repentance is obligatory at all times, but when the Muslim combines sincere repentance with good deeds during the days of most virtue, this is a sign of success, in sha Allah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;But as for him who repented, believed and did righteous deeds, then he will be among those who are successful.&quot; [al-Qasas 28:67] The Muslim should make sure that he does not miss any of these important occasions, because time is passing quickly. Let him prepare himself by doing good deeds which will bring him reward when he is most in need of it, for no matter how much reward he earns, he will find it is less than he needs; the time of departure is at hand, the journey is frightening, delusions are widespread, and the road is long, but Allah is ever watchful, and to Him will we return and render account. As the Quran says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it, And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.&quot; [al-Zalzalah 99:7-8] There is much to be gained, so make the most of the opportunity afforded by these invaluable and irreplaceable ten days. Hasten to do good works, before death strikes, before one can regret ones negligence and failure to act, before one is asked to return to a place where no prayers will be answered, before death intervenes between the hopeful one and the things he hopes for, before you are trapped with your deeds in the grave. O you whose hard heart is as dark as the night, is it not time that your heart was filled with light and became soft? Expose yourself to the gentle breeze of your Lords mercy during these ten days, for Allah will cause this breeze to touch whomever He wills, and whoever is touched by it will be happy on the Day of Judgement. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and all his Family and Companions. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>How to start propagation</title>
    <question>If one wants to call somebody to Islam, how should he start?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Calling to Allah must be accompanied by wisdom, peaceful advice and flexibility. Callers to Allah are to focus on the most important issues and move to what follows. The Prophet, peace be upon him, said to Muath ibn Jabal when he sent him to Yemen, First, call them to testify that there is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger. If they respond, ask them to perform five daily prayers. If they respond, tell them that Allah has imposed Zakat (Alms taxes) which is to be taken from the rich and distributed among the poor. One should also wait for the best opportunity by choosing the suitable time and place for propagation.</answer>

    <title>Does a Wife Have to Cook and Clean?</title>
    <question>Is it the wife's duty to do all the housework, must the husband help her or not? Or is it possible that her work is just a favour to the husband and the family and she will be rewarded for it, as if she gave sadaqah?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Should the wife serve her husband? Evidence for the view that it is a womans duty to serve her husband Praise be to Allah.Should the wife serve her husband? The more correct view in this matter is that stated by a number of scholars, such as Abu Bakr ibn Abi Shaybah, Abu Ishaq al-Jawzjani and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on them), who said that it is the womans duty to serve her husband within the bounds of what is reasonable and as other women who are like her serve husbands who are like him. She also has to take care of the house, doing things like cooking and so on, in accordance with what is customary among people like her and her husband. This differs according to circumstances, time and place, hence Ibn Taymiyah said: This varies according to circumstances. What the Bedouin wife has to do is not the same as what the urban wife has to do. Evidence for the view that it is a womans duty to serve her husband The evidence for this more correct opinion is: the Hadith of al-Bukhari: Imam al-Bukhari narrated in his Sahih that Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her), the daughter of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) asked him for a servant. He said, Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than that? When you go to sleep, say Subhan-Allah (Glory be to Allah) thirty three times, Al-Hamdu Lillah (praise be to Allah) thirty three times, and Allahu akbar (Allah is Most Great) thirty four times. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, part 9/506) Al-Tabari said, in his commentary on this Hadith: We may understand from this Hadith that every woman who is able to take care of her house by making bread, grinding flour and so on, should do so. It is not the duty of the husband if it is the custom for women like her to do this themselves. What we learn from the Hadith is that when Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with her) asked her father (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) for a servant, he did not command her husband to find her a servant or hire someone to do these tasks, or to do these tasks himself. If it were Alis duty to do these things, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would have commanded him to do them. The Hadith of Asma bint Abi Bakr Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih that Asma bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said: I got married to al-Zubayr, and he had no wealth on earth and no slaves, nothing except a camel for bringing water and his horse. I used to feed his horse and bring water, and I used to sew patches on the bucket. I made dough but I was not good at baking bread, so my (female) neighbours among the Ansar used to bake bread for me, and they were sincere women. I used to bring date pits from al-Zubayrs land that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had given to him, carrying them on my head. This land was two-thirds of a farsakh away. One day I came, carrying the date pits on my head, and I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), who had a group of the Ansar with him. He called me and made his camel kneel down for me to ride behind him, but I felt too shy to go with the men, and I remembered al-Zubayr and his jealousy, for he was the most jealous of people. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) realized that I felt shy, so he moved on. I came to al-Zubayr and told him, I met the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when I was carrying date pits on my head, and he had a group of his Companions with him. He made his camel kneel down for me to ride with him, but I remembered your jealousy. He said, By Allah, it bothers me more that you have to carry the date pits than that you should ride with him. Asma said: After that, Abu Bakr sent me a servant to take care of the horse, and it was as if I had been liberated from slavery. (Reported by al-Bukhari, Fath, 9/319). In the commentary on the Hadith of Asma, it says: From this incident we may understand that it is the woman's duty to take care of everything that her husband needs her to take care of. This was the opinion of Abu Thawr. Other fuqaha suggested that Asma did this voluntarily and that she was not obliged to do it. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said: It seems that this incident Asma carrying the date pits to help her husband and other similar incidents were the matter of necessity, namely that her husband al-Zubayr and other Muslim men were preoccupied with jihad and other things that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had commanded them to do, and they did not have time to take care of domestic matters themselves, and could not afford to hire servants to do that for them, and there was no one else who could do that apart from their womenfolk. So the women used to take care of the home and whoever lived in it, so that the men could devote their time to supporting Islam. Then he said (may Allah have mercy on him): What is more likely is that the matter had to do with the customs in that land, for customs may vary in this regard. It seems that what Ibn Hajar said is close to the view of those who say that the wife has to take care of her husband and the home in accordance with the dictates of local custom. Ibn al-Qayyim said, concerning the story of Asma: When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saw Asma with the date pits on her head, and her husband al-Zubayr was with her, he did not tell him that she did not have to serve him, or that this was unfair to her. He approved of her serving him and of all the women among the Sahabah helping their husbands. This is a matter concerning which there is no doubt. The Hadith of Jabir The Shaykh of the Muhaddithin, Imam al-Bukhari (may Allah have mercy on him) reported in his Sahih that Jabir ibn Abd-Allah said: My father died and left seven daughters, or nine daughters. I married a woman who had been previously married, and the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said to me, Did you get married, O Jabir? I said, Yes. He asked, A virgin or a previously-married woman? I said, A previously-married woman. He said, Why not a young woman so you could play and joke with one another? I said, Abd-Allah [the father of Jabir] has died and left behind daughters, and I would not like to bring them someone who is like them, so I got married to a woman who can take care of them. He said, May Allah bless you or Fair enough. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, vol.9/513). The evidence derived from the Hadith of Jabir is that al-Bukhari introduced this Hadith under the heading, Bab awn al-marah zawjaha fi waladih (Chapter: a woman helping her husband with his children). Imam Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said, commenting on this introduction by al-Bukhari: It seems that al-Bukhari derived the idea that a woman should take care of her husbands children from the fact that the wife of Jabir took care of his sisters; if she should take care of his sisters then it is even more befitting that she should take of his children. (Sahih al-Bukhari bi Sharh al-Asqalani, vol.9/513). We can say that the wife should take care of her husband, as this is more befitting than her taking care of his sisters or his daughters from another wife. We may also understand from this Hadith that what was customary at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was that women did not only take care of their husbands, they also took care of those who were dependent on their husbands and lived in their houses. The evidence that this understanding is correct is the fact that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did not tell Jabir off for his reason for marrying a previously-married woman, which was that she could take care of his sisters. This indicates that the custom among the Muslims at that time dictated that the wife should take care of those who were under her husbands care, which means that the wife should serve her husband in those matters that are dictated by local custom, because the husbands right to be served by his wife comes before that of his sisters. Urf (custom) General contracts including marriage contracts should be governed by the customs that are known among the people, and the custom is that the wife should serve her husband and also take care of matters in the home. In some societies, the custom is that the wife should take care of more than the regular domestic matters. Imam al-Qurtubi said, concerning the matter of the wife serving her husband and taking care of the home: This has to do with Urf, which is one of the bases of Shari`ah. The women of the Bedouin and the desert-dwellers serve their husbands, even looking for fresh water and taking care of the animals What happens nowadays is that the wife usually serves her husband and takes care of different matters within the home. There may be a servant to help her with that if her husband can afford it. If the husband knows that the majority of scholars say that it is not obligatory for the wife to serve her husband and take care of the house, I say that one of the benefits of this may be that he will not go to extremes and demand too much of his wife in this regard, and that he will not give her a hard time if she falls short, because what she is doing is not a duty according to the majority of jurists. However, even it is a duty according to some of them and this is what we think is more correct the fact that there is such a difference of opinion means that the husband has to look at what she is doing as something voluntary rather than obligatory, or something in which the scholars differ as to whether it is obligatory, so he should be gentle with her if he sees that she is falling short in this regard, and he should encourage her and help her to do it.

    <title>Fasting in countries where the day is very short or very long</title>
    <question>In some parts of the Scandinavian countries, the day may be much longer than the night, depending on the time of year. The night may be only three hours long, when the day is twenty-one hours. If it happens that Ramadaan comes in the winter, the Muslims fast for only three hours, but if it happens that Ramadaan comes in the summer, they do not fast because they are not able to, as the day is so long. Please tell us when we should have suhoor and iftaar, and on how many days of Ramadaan we should fast.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Islam is perfect and comprehensive. Allaah says (interpretation of the meanings):  This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion [al-Maaidah 5:3] Say [O Muhammad]: What thing is the most great to witness? Say: Allaah (the Most Great!) is Witness between me and you; this Quraan has been revealed to me that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach [al-Anaam 6:19] And We have not sent you [O Muhammad] except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind. [Saba 34:28] Allaah has told the believers that fasting is obligatory (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Observing al-sawm (fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become the pious. [al-Baqarah 2:183] And Allaah has explained when the fasting should begin and end (interpretation of the meaning):  and eat and drink until the white thread (light of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your fast till the nightfall [al-Baqarah 2:187] This ruling is not addressed to any particular country or type of people; it is a universal law, which also includes the people asked about in the question. Allaah is Merciful and Kind towards His slaves and has prescribed for them ways of ease to help them to do what He has made obligatory. For example, He allows travellers and the sick not to fast during Ramadaan, to save them from hardship, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): The month of Ramadaan in which was revealed the Quraan, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadaan, i.e., is present at his home), he must observe fasting that month, and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe sawm (fasts( must be made up] from other days [al-Baqarah 2:185] So every responsible adult Muslim who is present when Ramadaan comes is obliged to fast, no matter whether the day is short or long. If a person is unable to complete a days fast, and fears that he may die or become ill, he is permitted to eat just enough to keep his strength up and keep himself safe from harm, then he should stop eating and drinking for the rest of the day, and he has to make up the days he has missed later on, when he is able to fast. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Saying Yaa Rasool Allaah</title>
    <question>I want to know that can we say Ya Rasool-Allah or not.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to call upon anyone other than Allaah, whether at times of ease or times of hardship, no matter how great the status of the one who is called upon, even if he is a Prophet who is close to Allaah, or one of the angels, because duaa is a form of worship. It was narrated from al-Numaan ibn Basheer that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Duaa is worship, then he recited (interpretation of the meaning): And your Lord said: Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything] I will respond to your (invocation). Verily, those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islamic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation! [Ghaafir 40:60] Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2895; Ibn Maajah, 3818; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2370. Worship is due only to Allaah; it is not permitted to direct worship towards anyone else. Hence the Muslims are agreed that whoever calls upon anyone other than Allaah is a mushrik (polytheist, one who associates others with Allaah). Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: Whoever regards the angels and Prophets as intermediaries whom he calls upon, puts his trust in and asks them to bring that which will benefit him and ward off harmful things, such as asking them to forgive sins, guide them, relieve them of distress and meet their needs, is a kaafir, according to the consensus of the Muslims. Majmoo al-Fataawa, 1/124. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: The kinds of shirk include asked the dead for one's needs, or seeking their help, or turning to them. This is the essence of shirk. Fath al-Majeed, p. 145 Hence Allaah has said that there is no one more astray than the one who calls on others besides Him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And who is more astray than one who calls on (invokes) besides Allaah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls (invocations) to them? And when mankind are gathered (on the Day of Resurrection), they (false deities) will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping [al-Ahqaaf 46:5-6] How can he call on others besides Allaah, when Allaah has told us that they are helpless? Allaah says: And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmeer (the thin membrane over thedate stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad) like Him Who is the AllKnower (of everything) [Faatir 35:13-14] Shaykh Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Hasan Aal al-Shaykh said: Allaah tells us the situation of those who are called upon instead of Him, of the angels, Prophets, idols, etc. in a manner that indicates their helplessness and weakness, and that they lack the abilities that are to be expected in the one who is called upon, such as sovereignty, the ability to hear the call and the ability to respond. Fath al-Majeed, p. 158 How can the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) be called upon, when Allaah has commanded him to say, Say: It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path [al-Jinn 72:21  interpretation of the meaning]? And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If you ask, then ask of Allaah, and if you seek help, then seek the help of Allaah. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 2516; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi, 2043. Hence there can be no doubt that it is a mistake to praise the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in the words O most noble of creation, I have nobody to turn to except you when calamity strikes. The major scholars have denounced this as being wrong. Shaykh Abd al-Azeez ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said, in his footnotes to the book Fath al-Majeed, commenting on the poem Burdat al-Busayri from which these words are taken: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) warned us, according to the report narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim, Do not praise me as the Christians praised Eesa ibn Maryam, I am the slave of Allaah and His Messenger. Rather the way to venerate him and love him is by following his Sunnah and establishing his religion and rejecting all the myths that the ignorant attribute to him. But most of the people do not do this, and they occupy themselves with this exaggeration and praise which leads them to commit major shirk. Fath al-Majeed, p. 155 Moreover, it is not known that even a single Sahaabi used to seek the help of the Messenger or call upon the Messenger, neither was that transmitted from any of the respectable scholars. It is only one of the myths of the deviant. If something troubles you, then say Yaa Allaah, for He is the One Who answers prayers, relieves distress and controls all things. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>First and second glance at women</title>
    <question>I know it is absolutely forbidden to gaze at women. If one accidentally catches my eyes sometimes I keep looking for a second or two and then I remember Allaah's command and immediately look down .
My question is for that very little time that I do look at the lady do I earn sins?
I was reading in Yusuf Qradawai's halaal wal haraam fil Islam that the Qur'aan says lower the gaze, and that the gaze is defined by &quot;carressing the eyes with her beauty or thinking lustful thoughts while looking &quot;. Alhamdulillaah, I have never gone to this point inshaa-Allaah . But I am worried about those two seconds . May Allaah bless you</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Jareer ibn Abdullaah said: &quot;I asked the Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) about an accidental glance at a woman. He commanded me to turn my gaze away.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. See al-Sunan, 2700). Commenting on this hadeeth, al-Mubaarakpoori said: &quot; Accidental means that his gaze fell on a non-mahram woman unintentionally. He commanded me to turn my gaze away means that he was not to look a second time, because the first glance was not by choice and would be forgiven, but any further glances would be counted as sin, and he should heed the words of Allaah (interpretation of the meaning): Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) [al-Noor 24:30]&quot; The Messenger of Allaah (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;O Ali, do not follow a glance with another, for you will be forgiven for the first, but not for the second.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 2701; see Saheeh al-Jaami, 7953) In al-Tuhfah, he said: &quot;The words do not follow a glance with another mean do not look again after the first glance. You will be forgiven for the first means that you will be forgiven if the first glance was unintentional, and but not for the second means that because the second glance was by choice, it will be counted against you.&quot; So it is clear that deliberately looking at a non-mahram woman and continuing to look after a first accidental glance is haraam. It is forbidden to look at any part of her body, whether you think she is beautiful or not, whether it provokes sexual desire or not, whether it is accompanied by evil thoughts or not, and whether it leads to immoral deeds or not. We ask Allaah to protect you and us from all haraam deeds. Allaah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path.</answer>

    <title>Calling oneself by one of Allaah&amp;#146;s names in ignorance</title>
    <question>After embracing Islam, I ignorantly changed my name to one of Allah's 99 names. It's been a year and all my records reflect this name not to mention that everyone is accustomed to it. Am I burdened to officially put an Abdul infront of my name or can I just start verbally using it? Also, I was told that it was haram to change my name.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Some of Allaahs names are also suitable for human beings and it is permissible to use them, so long as one distinguishes between the meaning applied to the Creator and the meaning applied to the created being, such as Kareem (generous), Lateef (kind), Shaheed (witness), Hakeem (wise), etc. Other Divine names may not be given to human beings because they are befitting only for Allaah, such as al-Baari (the Creator), al-Raaziq (the Provider), al-Muhyi (the Giver of Life), al-Awwal (the First), al-Aakhir (the Last), etc. If your name is of the first type, then there is nothing wrong with it. If it is of the second type, then putting the word &quot;Abd&quot; (slave of) in front of the name will solve the problem. May Allaah help us to adhere to the truth. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <question>What does Islam say about life partner,,,is she/he fixed by Allah or Allah has left it for us to decided?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. First of all, we should realize that there is no contradiction between our belief that Allaah has decreed everything, and our belief that He has given us free will which enables us to do things. Confirming the free will of His slaves, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;To whomsoever among you wills to walk straight&quot; [al-Takweer 81:28] Our will operates within the will of Allaah, not outside of it, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;But you cannot will, unless Allaah wills&quot; [al-Insaan 76:30] Thus it is not permitted to try to cancel one idea out with the other, or to deny either of them. Allaah has confirmed both, that man has the power to choose, and that nothing can operate outside of His Will, may He be glorified. If we apply this to the question asked, we will see that man has freedom of will through which he can choose whichever woman he wishes to marry, and that whatever choice he makes has already been decreed by Allaah. The mans choice is the means by which he gets what he wants, but some obstacles may come between the person and what he wants, in which case he will realize that Allaah has not decreed this for him, for some reason which is known to Him. Everything that Allaah does is good, and His slaves do not have knowledge of the Unseen or of how things will end. A person may regret missing out on something when it is good that he did not have it, or he may hate something that happens to him when it is good that it happened to him, as Allaah tells us (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know.&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:216] May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Obtaining a discount card in return for paying a certain amount</title>
    <question>In some bookshops there are advertisements for a scheme whereby the customer pays a set amount of money each month and gets two things: he will be supplied with new books in a specific area of interest, such as fiqh, etc, and he will get a 10% discount if he wants to buy books from these stores. What is the ruling on this?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This is a kind of gambling, concerning which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): O you who believe! Intoxicants (all kinds of alcoholic drinks), gambling, al-ansaab (stone altars for making sacrifices to idols, etc.) and al-azlaam (arrows for seeking luck or decision) are an abomination of Shaytaans handiwork. So avoid (strictly all) that (abomination) [al-Maaidah 5:90] Gambling means everything that involves one side trying to take advantage of the other, so that one will be the winner and the other will be the loser. This is the shari ruling on gambling. So a man who pays 500 riyals every month, for example, may buy books for which his discount adds up to more than a thousand riyals, or he may not buy anything at all. If we suppose that he buys things for which the discount adds up to more than five hundred riyals, then he will be the winner, and the storekeeper will be the loser; if he does not buy anything, then the storekeeper will be the winner and the man will be the loser, because he paid 500 riyals and did not get anything in return. This transaction is a kind of gambling and is not permissible.</answer>

    <title>Repentance of One Suffering from a Terminal Disease</title>
    <question>A man committed many sins. He is suffering from a severe illness and has tried treatment to no avail. The doctors have told him that they have no cure for his problem. Now he regrets his past and wants to repent. Does his repentance count now that he is suffering from this terminal illness from which he has no hope of a cure?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Yes, the repentance of a man who does not hope to live for long does count. This applies whether he has an incurable illness such as cancer; or he has been sentenced to death, such as a man who has been brought out for execution, even if the sword is being raised above his head; or a married man who has committed adultery and been sentenced to stoning, even if the stones have already been gathered. His repentance is valid, because Allah accepts the repentance of a man so long as the death rattle has not yet reached his throat. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Allah accepts only the repentance of those who do evil in ignorance and foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is they to whom Allah will forgive, and Allah is Ever All-Knower, All-Wise. [4:17] The meaning of the phrase and repent soon afterwards means that they repent before they die. In the following ayah (verse), Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says: Now I repent. [ 4:18] There are five essential conditions for repentance: sincerity, regret for what one has done, giving it up immediately, determination not to repeat it in the future, and repenting during the time when repentance will be accepted, i.e., before one dies or before the sun rises in the west.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on sitting    with smokers when they are smoking</title>
    <question>It is no secret that the forbidden habit of smoking is widespread, in the workplace, in the home and in public areas. The question is, is it permissible to sit with smokers? If a person is sitting with a smoker in his home or in a public gathering, should he leave him and go out?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.As the brother has mentioned, smoking is haraam because of the general evidence that indicates that it is haraam. There is no specific text from the Messenger SAWS (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), because smoking only emerged recently, but the principles of shareeah are general in application, and some indications in some reports indicate that it is haraam. If a smoker sits next to you and wants to smoke, then advise him gently and kindly. Tell him, My brother, this is haraam, and it is not permissible for you. I think that if you advise him kindly and gently, he will refrain from smoking, as we and others have found out by experience. If he does not refrain from smoking, then you have to leave him, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Quraan) that when you hear the Verses of Allaah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them [al-Nisa 4:140] But this is when it is in a public place. If it is in the workplace and you advise him but he does not refrain, then there is no sin on you, because this is the matter of necessity and you could not get away from him.</answer>

    <title>Seeking knowledge from scholars tapes</title>
    <question>There are some youths who know
   the way of true guidance to Allaah and are very keen to seek knowledge, but their
   circumstances do not allow them to do so. Is it enough for them to listen to the tapes
   recorded by shaykhs, and will they then be like other seekers of knowledge?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.With regard to whether this is enough for them, there is no doubt that this is good enough if they cannot go and be with the scholars. It makes up for not being able to be with the people of knowledge, although being with them is preferable and makes it easier to understand and discuss matters. But if they cannot do that, then listening to tapes is enough, because this is all they can do. Can they be regarded as students or seekers of knowledge when they are limiting themselves to that? We say, yes they can, if they make a great effort, just as a person can become a scholar if he takes knowledge from books. But the difference between taking knowledge from books and tapes and receiving it directly from the scholars is that it is much better to take it directly from the scholars, because then it is easy to discuss things, unlike when listening to tapes or reading books. It requires a great deal of effort to learn all aspects of knowledge in this way. (By the same token, learning directly from scholars means that one is less likely to misunderstand things than when one learns from tapes and books).</answer>

    <title>Eating Food Cooked with Alcohol</title>
    <question>Is it permissible to eat dishes cooked with alcohol? It is well-known that alcohol evaporates with heat.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is not permissible to eat dishes cooked with alcohol, as ALL the alcohol is not evaporated with cooking or heat. Refer to the following, quoted from the famous Mayo Clinic: [Begin quote] Many people believe that because alcohol is sensitive to heat, it is eliminated with cooking. However, not all the alcohol content of alcoholic drinks is removed with heat; it depends on the type and time of cooking. For instance if you add beer or wine to boiling liquid, then immediately remove it from the heat, 85 per cent of the alcohol content will remain. If you light the alcohol, as in flamb dishes, 75 per cent will remain. Even after simmering the dish for one and a half hours, it will still have 20 per cent of the original alcohol content. It is only if you simmer the mixture for two or more hours, (as you would with a wine-based beef casserole), that as little as five to 10 per cent of the original alcohol content remains.</answer>

    <title>Renovating orphans property with zakaah money</title>
    <question>There are some orphans whose guardian I am, as their father died many years ago. They have a monthly income from their fathers retirement fund of 3500 riyaals. Over the years I have accumulated a large sum of money, of which approximately 150,000 comes from zakaah. Should I stop accepting zakaah on their behalf? What should I do with the zakaah money I have? They have a house that needs to be repaired, and there is still 240,000 owing to the real-estate company.

Can I pay off the deceaseds debts from this (zakaah) money? They have land from the city so can we pay for building a fence around it from this money?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Firstly, it is not permissible for you to take zakaah on their behalf, because they have enough money of their own. Zakaah is for the poor and needy, not for orphans. Whatever you have taken at the time when they had enough of their own has to be given back to the original donors, if you know who they are, otherwise you must give it away in charity with the intention of it being zakaah on their behalf, because you took it with the intention of it being zakaah from them. As for the money that you have accumulated from the retirement fund, use it as you see fit, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And come not near to the orphans property, except to improve it [al-Anaam 6:152]. As for the debt to the real estate development company, you know that it is to be repaid in installments, not all at once, so pay it back in installments. The deceased has nothing to do with it, except with regard to the installments that were due before his death, if he did not pay them. As for the installments that were not due until after his death, they are nothing to do with him because they have to do with this property, the ownership of which has passed to his heirs. So they are responsible for these repayments, and they should not be paid from the zakaah money, because they have enough money of their own with which to pay them.</answer>

    <question>When should zakaah be paid on money that is loaned out?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This matter may be summed up as follows: 1. The lender has to pay zakaah annually on the money lent, if the borrower is rich and is known to repay debts promptly. In this case, because it is possible to recover the money readily, it is like money that is in one's possession. 2. The lender has to pay zakaah one full year after recovering the money if the borrower is in difficulty or is known to delay repayment. He does not have to pay zakaah before he gets the money back, because it is not readily accessible and this is not like money that is in one's possession.</answer>

    <title>Jinn Entering Human Bodies</title>
    <question>In the last few days a controversy has arisen concerning the matter of jinn entering human bodies. Some say that this is rationally impossible, because of the difference in the essences from which they were created, as man was created from clay and the jinn from fire. It has also been said that the shayateen (devils) have no power other than waswas (insinuating whispers) and that Allah has not given them any power over man. And it is said that the recorded tapes that are in circulation (recordings of jinn supposedly speaking through people) are no proof of anything. What is your response to all this?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The fact that jinn can enter human bodies is proven in the Quran and Sunnah (prophetic teachings), and by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah (main body of Muslims who are united upon the sunnah), and by real-life events. No one disputes this apart from the Mutazilah (a deviant sect) who give priority to their own rational analysis over the evidence of the Quran and Sunnah. We will mention a little about this below: Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Those who eat riba (interest) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity. That is because they say: Trading is only like Riba [2:275] Al-Qurtubi said in his Tafseer (exegesis): This ayah (verse) is proof that those people are wrong who deny that epilepsy is caused by the jinn and claim that its causes are only physical, and that the Shaytan does not enter people or cause madness. Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer, after mentioning the ayah quoted above: They will not rise from their graves on the Day of Resurrection except like the way in which the epileptic rises during his seizure, when he is beaten by the Shaytan. This is because they will rise in a very bad state. Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said: the one who consumes riba will rise on the Day of Resurrection crazy and choking. According to a saheeh hadeeth (authentic report) narrated by al-Nasai from Abul-Yusr, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to pray: Allahumma innee aoodhu bika min al-taraddi wal-haram wal-gharaq wal-harq, wa aoodhu bika an yatakhabatani al-shaytan ind al-mawt (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from being thrown from a high place, old age, drowning and burning; and I seek refuge with You from being beaten by the Shaytan at the time of death). Commenting on this hadeeth in Al-Fayd, al-Manawi said: [The phrase] and I seek refuge with You from being beaten by the Shaytan at the time of death means, lest he should wrestle with me and play with me, and damage my religious commitment or mental state (at the time of death) by means of his insinuating whispers which cause people to slip or lose their minds. The Shaytan could take control of a person when he is about to depart this world, and misguide him or stop him from repenting Ibn Taymiyah said: The fact that jinn can enter human bodies is proven by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Those who eat riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytan leading him to insanity. That is because they say: Trading is only like riba [2:275]. And in as-Saheeh it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: The Shaytan flows through the son of Adam as the blood flows through his veins. Abd-Allah ibn al-Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: I said to my father, There are some people who say that the jinn do not enter the body of the epileptic. He said: O my son, they are lying; the jinn could speak through this person. Commenting on this, Ibn Qudamah said: What he said is well known, because a person may suffer an epileptic seizure and speak in a language that no one understands, and his body may be beaten with blows that would fell a camel, but the epileptic does not feel them at all, and he is also unaware of the words he is saying. The epileptic and others may be dragged about, or the carpet on which he is sitting may be pulled, and utensils may be moved about from place to place, and other things may happen. Anyone who witnesses such a thing will know for sure that the one who is speaking through the person and moving these things is not human. And he said, may Allah have mercy on him: There is no one among the imams (religious leaders/scholars) of the Muslims who denies that jinn may enter the body of the epileptic and others. Anyone who denies this and claims that Islam denies it is lying about Islam. There is nothing in the proofs of shareeah (Islamic law) to show that it does not happen. So the fact that jinn may enter human bodies is proven in the Quran and Sunnah, and by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah, some of whose comments we have quoted above. As regards the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allahs Leave [2:102], this is undoubtedly a clear indication that the jinn cannot harm anyone through witchcraft or epilepsy or through any other kind of disturbance or misguidance, except with the permission of Allah. As al-Hasan al-Basri said: Whomever Allah wills, He gives them power over him, and whomever He does not will, He does not give them power over him, and they cannot do anything to anyone except with the permission of Allah. The Shaytan (who is the disbelieving jinn) may gain power over the believers by making them sin and by making them neglect the remembrance and Tawheed of Allah (maintaining Allahs Oneness) and sincerity in worshipping Him. But he has no power over the righteous slaves of Allah, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily, My slaves (i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism)  you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian. [17:65] During the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic days of ignorance) the Arabs were well aware of this and mentioned it in their poetry. For example, the poet al-Aasha likened his she-camels energy to that of one who was touched by the jinn, and said that it was the jinn who was giving her energy. As regards the causes of epilepsy, Ibn Taymiyah explained the causes. He said: When the jinn touch a person with epilepsy, it may be because of desire or love, just as happens between one human and another or it may  as is usually the case  be because of hatred and punishment, such as when a person has harmed them or they think that he has harmed them deliberately, either by urinating on them or pouring hot water on them or killing them, even if the person did that unknowingly. There are ignorant and wrongdoing ones among the jinn who may punish a person more than he deserves, or they may be playing with him and mistreating him, like foolish people among mankind. And I say: the way to save oneself from this is to remember Allah and speak His Name at the beginning of all things, as it was reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to mention Allah in many cases, such as when eating, drinking, mounting his riding-beast, taking off his clothes for any reason, having intercourse and so on As regards treatment (of one whose body has been entered by the jinn), Ibn Taymiyah said (Majmoo al-Fataawa, 19/42): When the jinn attack a person, they should be told of the rulings of Allah and His Messenger, proof should be established against them, and they should be commanded to do what is good and told not to do what is evil, just as should be done in the case of people, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning) [al-Israa 17:15]. Then he said: If the jinn does not leave after being addressed in this manner, then it is permissible to rebuke him, tell him off, threaten him and curse him, as the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) did with the Shaytaan when he came with a falling star to throw it in his face, and the Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: I seek refuge with Allah from you and I curse you with the curse of Allah  three times. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). We may also seek help against the jinn by remembering Allah (dhikr) and reciting Quran, especially Aayat al-Kursiy. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever recites it will remain under the protection of Allah and no Shaytaan (devil) will be able to approach him until the morning. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari). And al-Miwadhatayn (the last two soorahs of the Quran) may also be recited. As for psychiatrists who do not treat the epileptic in the manner described, they cannot do him any good at all. This issue may be discussed in much more detail, but what we have said here is sufficient for those who want to know a little about this matter, Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.</answer>

    <title>Letters of credit</title>
    <question>One of the practices which is well-known
   in the financial field nowadays is when a businessman wants to import a product, for
   example, he asks the bank for a letter of credit for a certain amount, either in his own
   account or from the bank itself, and the bank takes some form of payment for providing
   this letter of credit. What is the ruling on this?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Lord of the Worlds. Firstly: Letters of credit may be of different types, initial or final. Either type of letter of credit may or may not be covered by the balance in the businessmans account. If it is not covered, then the the issuer bears joint liability with the applicant with regard to current and future obligations. This is essentially what is known in Islamic fiqh as damaan (liability) or kafaalah (sponsorship or surety). If the letter of credit is covered, then the relationship between the one who is requesting it and the provider (the bank) is that of an agency. Acting as an agent is valid whether or not a fee is paid, so long as the agent relationship serves the interest of the one for whom it is done (in this case the third party from whom the good are being purchased). Kafaalah (sponsorship) is a voluntary agreement whose purpose is goodwill. The fuqaha have stated that it is not permissible to accept a fee in return for it, because in that case when the sponsor (kafeel) receives a sum of money when the credit is paid, it becomes like a loan which brought some benefit to the lender, which is not allowed in Islam [because it is like riba or interest  Translator]. On this basis, the following is clear: Firstly: that it is not permissible to charge a fee for issuing a letter of credit  which usually takes into account the amount of money and length of time involved  whether the credit is covered or not. Secondly: charging administration fees for preparing either type of letter of credit is permissible, so long as the amount charged does not exceed what is usual, whether the letter of credit is wholly or partly covered. In evaluating the administration fee for issuing a letter of credit, it should be taken into account what is actually involved in doing so. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

Many Muslim women claim that they cannot find suitable Muslim men, and that they are faced with the threat of having to commit sin or live in extremely straitened circumstances.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is forbidden for Muslim women to marry non-Muslim men, according to the Quraan, the Sunnah and the consensus of the scholars (ijmaa) (see question # 689) .

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.As soon as a woman embraces Islam and her husband refuses to do likewise, the marriage is annulled and it is not permissible for her to live with him. But she should wait out the length of the iddah period. If he embraces Islam, she may go back to him and the previous marriage contract is still counted as valid, but if he does not embrace Islam before the iddah is over, then they are no longer married. If he subsequently embraces Islam and they want to get back together, a new marriage contract must be drawn up. It is not permissible to continue the marriage on the basis of being kind to him.

    <title>Paying in installments</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on paying in installments, and what is the sharai solution in dealing with late payments on the part of some purchasers?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.It is permissible to charge more for purchases by installment than when a person is paying in full at the time of purchase. It is also permissible to name one price for cash sales, and another for payment by installments made within certain periods. The sale is not valid unless both parties are certain about either cash or installments. If there is some indecision with regard to cash or installments, and the two parties fail to reach an agreement on one specific price, then the sale is not permissible according to shareeah. According to shareeah, it is not permissible in the case of payment by installments, to state interest rates as a separate item based on the length of time taken to repay, regardless of whether the two parties agree on the rate of interest or it is based on the current rate. If the purchaser is late in paying the installments, it is not permissible to make him pay extra, whether or not this is arranged as a prior condition, because this is a form of forbidden ribaa. It is forbidden for a debtor who can afford the installments to delay payment when they are due. At the same time, according to shareeah it is not permissible to set a condition that he should pay compensation in the event of late payments. According to shareeah, it is permissible to set a condition that the debtor has to bring forward the payment, if he delays some of the payments, so long as the debtor agrees to this condition at the time when the contract is drawn up. The vendor does not have the right to keep the purchasers property after the item has been sold, but it is permissible for the vendor to stipulate some security as a guarantee that the purchaser will pay the installments. (Majma al-Fiqh al-Islami, p. 109) It is permissible according to shareeah to reduce the amount owing in order to expedite the settlement of the matter, whether this is done by request of the vendor or the purchaser. This is not counted as forbidden ribaa so long as it is not based on a prior agreement and so long as this agreement between the two parties is reached on a one-on-one basis, without the involvement of any third party, because in that case the rulings on the settlement of business accounts would apply. It is permissible for the two parties to agree that all installments should be paid immediately if the debtor fails to make one payment, unless he is in difficulty and has no means of paying. If the debt becomes due because the debtor dies, becomes bankrupt or delays payment, then in any of these circumstances it is permissible to reduce the debt so that the matter may be settled quickly to the mutual satisfaction of both parties. The definition of hardship which means that the vendor should wait for payment is: that the debtor should not have more wealth or property than he needs to meet his basic requirements and pay his debt.

    <title>Ruling on transactions made via modern means of communication</title>
    <question>What is the ruling on purchase and
   rental transactions etc. made via modern inventions such as the telephone, fax, telex and
   the Internet etc. If the transaction usually takes place in an office or store, what is
   the ruling on cases where these modern means are used?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.According to shareeah, a transaction is made when there is an offer [of goods or services] and this is accepted, within the framework of shar'i conditions and in the absence of anything that might invalidate the transaction. An example of this in the case of a sale might be when the vendor says I sell this to you and the purchaser says I agree. There have been major developments in the field of communications which are now widely used to speed up financial dealings and transactions, which we must bear in mind whilst also taking into account what the fuqahaa have said about carrying out transactions via letter, in writing, by means of gestures or through intermediaries. They also established that transactions should be carried out between two parties who are present in the same place with the exception of wills, the appointment of executors and the giving of power of attorney; the offer and agreement should both refer to the same thing and price, there should be no expression or indication that either party is turning away from the deal, and the agreement to an offer should not be delayed beyond whatever timespan is customarily regarded as acceptable. In the light of the above, the fuqahaa have established the following: If the transaction is carried out between two parties who are not present in the same place where one can actually see the other or hear his voice, and the only means of communication between them is by writing, mail, sending a messenger, this applies also to telegraphs, telexes, faxes and computer screens, in these cases the transaction is complete when the offer reaches the prospective purchaser and he agrees to it. If the transaction is drawn up at the same time, between two parties who are in different locations which applies to telephones and wireless communications the contract between them is considered to be a contract drawn up between two parties who are present in the same place, and in this case the basic rulings as stated by the fuqahaa and referred to in al-Deebaajah apply. If the vendor makes a limited-time offer through these means of communication, he is bound by it for the duration and he cannot go back on it. The rules outlined above do not include nikaah (marriage contracts) because of the requirement of two witnesses in nikaah, or barter because there has to be an actual exchange of goods or services, or forward buying, because this requires a cash down-payment. In cases where there is the possibility of forgery, fraud or error, reference should be made to the general rules concerning the establishment of proof.l And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>A menstruating woman is not naajis (impure)</title>
    <question>Do the clothes worn by a mestruating woman need to be washed even if they are not stained by the menstrual blood? Once her periods have finished, can a woman perform salat with the clothes that she wore while menstruating without washing them if they were not stained with the blood?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. So long as the clothes she is wearing do not contain any najaasah (impure substance), she is permitted to pray in them, even if she was wearing them during her monthly period. The menstruating woman herself is not naajis, neither is her sweat. The Jews used to think this, but Allaah stated that this was a lie, as is reported in the saheeh hadeeth narrated by Muslim (may Allaah have mercy on him) from Anas: &quot;When one of their women menstruated, the Jews would not eat with her or sit with her in their houses. The Companions of the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) asked the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) about this, and Allaah revealed the words (interpretation of the meaning): They ask you about menstruation. Say: That is an adhaa (a harmful thing for a husband to have intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they have purified (from menses and taken a bath) [al-Baqarah 2:222]. The Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: Do everything except have intercourse. Word of this reached the Jews and they said: What does this man mean, in every issue he differs from us!&quot; (Saheeh Muslim, 455). If the clothes get some menstrual blood on them, it is enough to remove the impurity with water and then she can pray in them. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <question>Is it possible for the wife to get a khula even if the husband will not agree to it? Can you mention some reasons ?.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.I put this question to our Shaykh Abd-Allaah ibn Abd al-Rahmaan ibn Jibreen, and he answered as follows: If a woman dislikes her husbands treatment of her  for example, he is over-strict, hot-tempered or easily-provoked, or gets angry a lot, or criticizes her and rebukes her for the slightest mistake or shortcoming, then she has the right of khula [female-instigated divorce]. If she dislikes his physical appearance because of some deformity or ugliness, or because one of his faculties is missing, she has the right of khula. If he is lacking in religious commitment  for example, he doesnt pray, or neglects to pray in jamaaah, or does not fast in Ramadaan without a proper excuse, or he goes to parties where haraam things are done, such as fornication, drinking alcohol and listening to singing and musical instruments, etc.  she has the right of khula. If he deprives of her of her rights of spending on her maintenance, clothing and other essential needs, when he is able to provide these things, then she has the right to ask for khula. If he does not give her her conjugal rights and thus keep her chaste because he is impotent (i.e. unable to have intercourse), or because he does not like her, or he prefers someone else, or he is unfair in the division of his time [i.e., among co-wives], then she has the right to ask for khula. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Meaning of Al-Mala al-Aala</title>
    <question>I am a non-Muslim who is currently enrolled in class studying Muslim traditions. I am writing a paper on the interpretation of prophets by commentators. One of the words being repeated is al-mala al-a'ala. I do not know what this means. I know that al-a'ala means the most high. Could you please help me with this? I appreciate your time and your help.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The phrase al-mala al-aala is mentioned in both the Quran and the sunnah (prophetic teachings). In Surah Saad, Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and discussing (about the creation of Adam). Only this has been inspired to me, that I am a plain warner.&quot; [38:69-70] In his commentary on this ayah (verse), Shaykh al-Mufassireen Ibn Jareer al-Tabari (may Allah have mercy on him) said: &quot;I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high (al-mala al-aala) when they were disputing and discussing: here Allah is telling His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) , O Muhammad, say to the mushrikeen (polytheists) among your people: &quot;I had no knowledge of the chiefs (angels) on high when they were disputing and discussing&quot; about the creation of Adam before Allah revealed this to me. What this means is: My telling you about this is clear proof that this Quran is a Revelation from Allah, because you know that I had no knowledge of this before this Quran was revealed; it is not something I witnessed with my own two eyes  I know it only because Allah has informed me of it.&quot; Other scholars of tafseer (exegesis) have said something similar to this. The comments of other scholars: Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) said: &quot;Allahs words (interpretation of the meaning) I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing refer to the angels, when they were consulted about the creation of Adam, and they disputed it and said: Do not place a khaleefah (vicegerent) on earth.&quot; Al-Saadi said: &quot; The chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing means:  when your Lord said to the angels: &quot;Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth&quot; [2:30] Qutadah said: &quot;The words I had no knowledge of the chiefs on high when they were disputing and discussing refer to the angels, who disputed the creation of Adam when Allah said to them, (interpretation of the meaning) Truly, I am going to create man from clay. [38:71]. As regards what was reported in the sunnah, Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said that Allah spoke to him in a dream and said, &quot;O Muhammad, do you know what the chiefs on high are disputing about? about the things which expiate for sins. Things that expiate for sins are: staying in the mosque after the prayers, walking to join congregational prayers and performing wudu properly when it is difficult to do so. Whoever does these things will have a good life and die a good death, and he will be as free from sin as on the day his mother bore him.&quot; [Al-Tirmidhi]) In his commentary on this hadeeth (narration), al-Mubarakpuri explained that &quot;the chiefs on high&quot; (al-mala al-aala) referred to the angels who are closest to Allah. Al-mala refers to nobles who attend gatherings and sit at their head because of their high status. They are described as al-aala either because they live on high, or because of their high status in the sight of Allah. Their &quot;dispute&quot; refers either to their competing or rushing to record these deeds and take them up to heaven, or to their discussing the virtue and blessing of these deeds, or to their feeling happy about people when they do these good deeds. It may have been called a &quot;dispute&quot; because it came in the form of questions and answers, which sounds like a dispute or a debate, hence it was appropriate to use the word &quot;dispute&quot; in this context.

    <answer>Praise be to Allah. It is not permissible for you to do work which involves carrying pork and delivering it to the people who are going to eat it. Because by doing so you are taking part and cooperating in sin. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Help you one another in al-birr and al-taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression&quot; [al-Maaidah 5:2] We ask Allaah to help you find acceptable work and a halaal income, for He is the All-Hearing Who answers prayers. &quot; And whoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine&quot; [al-Talaaq 65:2]</answer>

    <title>Practices following Salaat</title>
    <question>Bismillahir Rhamanir Rhahiim
As Salaamu Alaikum WRWB!!!
My question is in reference to the shaking of hands following the taslim after the obligatory salat. Also the raising of the hands and making du'a following the taslim of the like salat. Insha Allah may Allah (SWT) give us the strenght in gaining this knowledge. Jazak Allahu Khairun. As Salaamu Alaikum.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Neither of the two customs which you mention have any basis in Islamic texts. We should follow the Sunnah and keep away from innovations in religion. The best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him); the most evil of things are those which are innovated; every innovation is a bidah and every bidah is a going astray. Know, may Allaah help me and you, that the reservation concerning this matter does not have to do with shaking hands with a Muslim brother or raising the hands in duaa to Allaah; it has to do with the timing of these two actions, following the prayer, and making them a regular habit. If one were to raise ones hands between the adhaan and the iqaamah, as is encouraged in the Sunnah, or shake hands when meeting ones brothers on the way into or out of the mosque, or when seeing a brother next to one after a long absence, there is nothing wrong with that at all. We ask Allaah to help us to follow the Sunnah and to follow in the footsteps of His beloved, Muhammad (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him). And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <question>As-salam-alaikum
With all this talk of space exploration and &quot;whether there is life&quot; outside our beautiful planet, what does the Quran have to say about alien beings? Furthermore, should we discover life on another planet, how should we react to this new discovery? This may sound as a strange question, but the thought is in my belief an interesting one, which brings into question science that does not always work side by side with any religion. Salams.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Islam does not prevent man from attempting to explore space and the wonders it contains, or from looking at the dominion of Allaah and what He has created in heaven and earth, as He has commanded us to do in His Book. But we should pay attention to two things: We should weigh the time, effort and money spent on this purpose against the benefits which we expect to gain from it. Man should first learn how to walk and behave on earth before he tries to go into space. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>The      Black Stone</title>
    <question>what's the importance of the BlackStone in Kaaba, what does represent ?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There are a number of ahaadeeth etc. about the Black Stone which we will quote for our brother so that he may learn from them. 1. The Black Stone was sent down by Allaah to this earth from Paradise. It was narrated that Ibn Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The Black Stone came down from Paradise. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 877; al-Nasaai, 2935. The hadeeth was classed as saheeh by al-Tirmidhi). 2. The Stone was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black. It was narrated that Ibn Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: When the Black Stone came down from Paradise, it was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 877; Ahmad, 2792. Classed as saheeh by Ibn Khuzaymah, 4/219. Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar classed it as qawiy (strong) in Fath al-Baari, 3/462). (a) Al-Mubaarakfoori said in al-Marqaah: This means, the sins of the sons of Adam who touched the stone, caused it to turn black. The hadeeth should be taken at face value, because there is no reason not to, either narrated in a report or by virtue of common sense. (Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi, 3/525) (b) Al-Haafiz ibn Hajar said: Some heretics tried to criticize this hadeeth by saying: How come the sins of the mushrikeen turned it black and the worship of the people of Tawheed did not make it white? I answer by quoting what Ibn Qutaybah said: If Allaah had willed, that would have happened. But Allaah has caused it to be the case that black usually changes other colours and its not itself changed, which is the opposite to what happens with white. (c) Al-Muhibb al-Tabari said: The fact that it is black is a lesson for those who have insight. If sins can have this effect on an inanimate rock, then the effect they have on the heart is greater. See Fath al-Baari, 3/463 3. The Black Stone will come forth on the Day of Resurrection and will testify in favour of those who touched it in truth. It was narrated that Ibn Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said concerning the Stone: By Allaah, Allaah will bring it forth on the Day of Resurrection, and it will have two eyes with which it will see and a tongue with which it will speak, and it will testify in favour of those who touched it in sincerity. Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 961; Ibn Maajah, 2944 This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, and as qawiy by al-Haafiz ibn Hajar in Fath al-Baari, 3/462 (4) Touching, kissing or pointing to the Black Stone  this is the first thing to be done when starting Tawaaf, whether it is for Hajj or Umrah, or voluntary Tawaaf. It was narrated from Jaabir ibn Abd-Allaah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that when the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came to Makkaah, he came to the Black Stone and touched it, then he walked to the right of it and ran three times and walked four times [around the Kabah]. (narrated by Muslim, 1218). (5) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kissed the Black Stone, and his ummah followed his lead in doing so. It was narrated that Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) came to the Black Stone and kissed it, then he said: I know that you are only a stone which can neither bring benefit nor cause harm. Were it not that I had seen the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) kiss you, I would not have kissed you. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1520; Muslim, 1720) (6) If a person is unable to kiss the Stone, he should touch it with his hand or something else, then he can kiss the thing with which he touched it. (a) It was narrated that Naafi said: I saw Ibn Umar touch the Stone with his hand then he kissed his hand. I said, I have never ceased to do this since I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) do it. (Narrated by Muslim, 1268) (b) It was narrated that Abu Tufayl (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) performing Tawaaf around the House, touching the corner [where the Stone is] with a crooked staff which he had with him, then kissing the staff. (Narrated by Muslim, 1275). (7) If a person is unable to do the above, then he can point to it with his hand and say Allaahu akbar. It was narrated that Ibn Abbaas said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) performed Tawaaf on his camel, and every time he came to the corner [where the Stone is] he would point to it and say Allaahu akbar. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 4987). (8) Touching the Stone is one of the things by means of which Allaah expiates for sins It was narrated that Ibn Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say: Touching them both [the Black Stone and al-Rukn al-Yamani] is an expiation for sins. (Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 959. This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi and as saheeh by al-Haakim (1/664). Al-Dhahabi agreed with him). It is not permissible for a Muslim to annoy other Muslims at the Stone by hitting or fighting. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that the Stone will testify in favour of those who touched it in sincerity, which is not the case when a person touches it by disturbing the slaves of Allaah.

    <title>Is it permissible for a woman to slaughter an animal, and can the meat of an animal she slaughters be eaten?</title>
    <question>My wife asked me an interesting question:Did any of the sahabiyyat ever slaughter an animal  during the `eid?Is this a proof that women can slaughter an animal if indeed any
 of the sahabiyyat slaughtered?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The scholars of Islam are agreed that it is permissible to eat the meat of an animal slaughtered by a woman, because of the general terms used in the wording of the Quraan and Sunnah. Among the evidence that it is permissible are the following: The aayah in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): Forbidden for you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals  cattle-beast not slaughtered), blood, the flesh of swine, and the meat of that which has been slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allaah, or has been slaughtered for idols, etc., or on which Allaahs Name has mot been mentioned while slaughtering, and that which has been killed by strangling, or by a violent blow, or by a headlong fall, or by the goring of horns  and that which has been (partly) eaten by a wild animal  unless you are able to slaughter it (before its death) [al-Maaidah 5:3]. The evidence in this aayah is the phrase where Allaah has permitted us to eat of any animal that we are able to slaughter before it dies; this is general in application, and does not specify as to whether the person who manages to do this is a man or a woman  so it could be either. Al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh from Ubayd-Allaah from Naafi, that he (Naafi) heard Ibn Kab ibn Maalik narrating from his father that they used to have sheep which they allowed to graze on the mountain of Sala in Madeenah: one of the slave-women noticed that one of the sheep was dying, so she broke a stone and slaughtered it. He said: Do not eat it until I ask the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) or I send someone to ask him. So he asked the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), or sent someone else to ask, and he told him to eat it. Ubay-Allaah said: I liked the fact that she was a slave-woman and she managed to slaughter it. Commenting on this hadeeth, Ibn Hijr (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: This shows that it is permitted to eat meat slaughtered by a woman, whether she is free or a slave, old or young, Muslim or of the People of the Book (i.e., Jewish or Christian), in a state of purity or otherwise, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told them to eat the meat she had slaughtered and did not ask for further details. This hadeeth also answers the question about whether any of the Sahaabiyaat (female Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) slaughtered animals. The discussion above also makes it clear that a woman may slaughter animals, because of the general terms used in the texts, and there is no difference in this regard between meat slaughtered as a sacrifice or meat slaughtered for regular food. Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah said: It is permitted to eat from an animal which a man or a woman slaughters Islamically before it dies, or from meat slaughtered by a woman, even if she is menstruating, because her menstruation is not in her hand. It is permissible to eat meat from an animal which a woman slaughters Islamically before it dies, by the consensus of the Muslims. (Al-Fataawa, 35/234).</answer>

As for meeting Allaah and seeing Him: meeting Him occurs after death and on the Day of Judgement; seeing Him will occur only on the Day of Judgement. Concerning the meeting with Allaah after death, Imaam al-Bukhaari (may Allaah have mercy on him) reported in his Saheeh, in the chapter on &quot;whoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah loves to meet him&quot;: From Ubaadah ibn al-Saamit, from the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) who said: &quot;Whoever loves to meet Allaah, Allaah will love to meet him, and whoever hates to meet Allaah, Allaah will hate to meet him.&quot; Aaishah or one of his wives said: &quot;But we all dislike the idea of death.&quot; He said, &quot;It is not what you are thinking. When death approaches the believer and he is given the news of Allaahs pleasure and honour, nothing will be more dear to him than what lies ahead of him, so he will love to meet Allaah and Allaah will love to meet him. But when death approaches the disbeliever and he is given the news of Allaahs wrath and punishment, nothing will be more disliked by him that what lies ahead of him, so he will hate to meet Allaah and Allaah will hate to meet him.&quot; (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 6026). The words &quot;nothing will be more dear to him than what lies ahead of him&quot; refer to what he will go through after death. Muslim and al-Nisaai report that Shurayh ibn Haani said: &quot;I said to Aaishah: I have heard a hadeeth which, if it is as I heard it, means that we are doomed. The hadeeth says: &quot;There is not one of us who does not dislike death.&quot; She said: It is not what you think. What it means is when a persons eyes stare without blinking, when the death rattle is in his chest and his skin and muscles contract. This is the state of one who is dying. &quot;Al-Khattaabi said: &quot;There are different types of meeting: it may mean seeing with ones own eyes, or it may mean resurrection, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):They indeed are losers who denied their meeting with Allaah [al-Anaam 6:31]; or it may mean death, as Allaah says: (interpretation of the meaning): Whoever hopes for the Meeting with Allaah, then Allaahs term is surely coming [al-Ankaboot 29:5] and Say (to them): Verily, the death from which you flee will surely meet you [al-Jumuah 62:8]&quot; The meeting with Allaah (mentioned in the hadeeth quoted above) refers to something other than death, because in another hadeeth the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said, &quot;Death is a barrier between us and the meeting with Allaah.&quot; But when death is the means of meeting Allaah, it is described as the meeting with Allaah. Imaam Abu Ubayd al-Qaasim ibn Salaam said: &quot;The hadeeth does not refer to a dislike of death and the suffering involved, because everybody feels this way. What is being criticized here is a love and preference for this world and a dislike of the idea of moving on to Allaah and the Hereafter. This is explained by the fact that Allaah condemned people who love this life, and said (interpretation of the meaning):  those who hope not for their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present world [Yoonus 10:7].&quot; Al-Nawawi said: &quot;The meaning of the hadeeth is that the like and dislike referred to are those that occur at the time of death, at the stage when repentance is no longer acceptable, when the dying person is shown where he is headed. There is also some discussion in the hadeeth about the dislike of death. Whoever dislikes death because he prefers this life to the blessings of the Hereafter is condemned. Whoever dislikes death because he fears being brought to account for his shortcomings, lack of preparation and failure to carry out the commands of Allah properly, is not to blame in this case. The one who feels this way should hasten to prepare himself so that when death comes to him he will not dislike it but will love it because of the meeting with Allaah which he is hoping for after death. The hadeeth quoted above also indicates that no living person will see Allaah in this life, but that the believers will see Him after death, as the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) said: &quot;Death is a barrier between us and the meeting with Allaah.&quot; This fact is stated even more clearly in another hadeeth narrated by Muslim from Abu Umaamah, in which the Prophet (Peace &amp; Blessings of Allaah be upon Him) says: &quot;Know that you will not see your Lord until you die.&quot; The meeting with Allaah and seeing Him on the Day of Judgement is proven in many texts, such as the aayah (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Some faces that Day will be naadirah (shining and radiant), looking at their Lord.&quot; [al-Qiyaamah 75:22-23] Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported that the people said, &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, will we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any doubts about seeing the full moon on a cloudless night?&quot; They said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;Do you have any doubts about seeing the sun on a cloudless day?&quot; They said, &quot;No.&quot; He said, &quot;Then you will see your Lord in the same way.&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 764). We ask Allaah to let us meet Him when He is pleased with us. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Wants to embrace Islam but is married to a non-Muslim</title>
    <question>I have been practicing Islam for a while now and I want to insha-Allah embrace it but there are serious problems that I am encountering. My husband and I have been having marital problems for a while now and even though things are going alright I don't trust that it would be like this forever because he has these violent ourbursts of rage and I have seriously considered divorcing him after I was advised to do so by our councellor.
The problem is that I don't love him anymore and moreover he won't allow me to embrace Islam and he refuses to embrace it as well. He said that we would rather break up rather than me becoming Muslim. The other problem is that I have two daughters who are attending a Hindu School and what does the Sharia say about what happens after I convert with regards to my daughters. I have met a wonderful Muslim man and we love each other very much and he asked me twice already to marry him. I did not go to bed with him and that is not our intention. We love each other for who we are and he is willing to accept my children if they convert as well. He said that he will wait until the end of the year before he goes on with his life because there are other women who he can settle down with but I am his first preference.

Please advice me and in English please because I do not understand Arabic. I need to take action about so many things, yet I feel guilty and I feel sorry for my husband because he is trying to make our marraige to work. Unfortunately the religion is a big problem.

Your urgent help and co operation will be highly appeciated.

Jazak Allah</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Your husband is preventing you from embracing Islam, and does not want to become Muslim himself. He prefers divorce to Islam, although you have tried to persuade him of the truth to no avail. This means that this man is no good. Moreover, you say that he is bad-tempered and violent, that any improvement is only temporary, and that you do not love him at all. If this man is as you say, he is no good from either a religious or a worldly point of view, and there is no use in staying with him. Our advice to you in this case is to leave him immediately, and try hard to gain custody of your two daughters so that they may grow up in Islam. According to Islamic shareeah, in such cases custody should be awarded to the Muslim parent, because Islam should prevail, not be prevailed over. As regards the second part of your question, and this man whom you say is a Muslim, you must make sure that he is a chaste man, not one who is immoral or corrupt. Do not establish any relationship with him before marriage. If you find out for sure that he is chaste and solidly religious, I advise you to marry him as soon as your iddah (waiting period after divorce) is over. I ask Allaah to take care of you by His mercy, to make the right thing easy for you, to help you enter this religion and to save you from kufr and its followers. Remember the story of Pharaohs wife, who was Muslim although her husband was a kaafir. Allaah said about her (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And Allaah sets forth an example for those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh, when she said: My Lord! Build for me a home with You in Paradise, and save me from Pharaoh and his work, and save me from the people who are zaalimoon (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in Allaah).&quot; [al-Tahreem 66:11] May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Is All Seafood Halal?</title>
    <question>Please forgive me for my ignorance in this matter. I am very interested in learning the ways of Islam. My question concerns dietary rulings. What types of fish and seafood are permissible?
Thank you for your help.</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Islam: Easy to follow Is seafood halal? Forbidden water animals Praise be to Allah.Islam: Easy to follow Among the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon us is the fact that He has made our religion easy for us, and has not made it too difficult or unbearable. He has allowed us many things that were forbidden according to previously-revealed laws. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  Allah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you [al-Baqarah 2:185] Is seafood halal? Hence all kinds of food from the sea are permissible, whether they are plants or animals, alive or dead. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food  for the benefit of yourselves and those who travel [al-Maidah 5:96]. Ibn 'Abbas said:  Sayduhu (lit. hunting, pursuit) refers to whatever is taken from it alive, and taamuhu (lit. its food) means whatever is taken dead. Forbidden water animals There are a few things  certain types of water animals  which some scholars exclude from the permission outlined above. These are: 1- Crocodiles: The correct view is that eating these is not allowed, because they have fangs and live on land  even though they may spend a lot of time in the water  so precedence should be given to the reason for forbidding it (it is a land animal that has fangs). 2- Frogs: It is not permitted to eat them because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade killing them, as is reported in the hadith of Abd al-Rahman ibn Uthman, who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) forbade the killing of frogs. (Narrated by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Majah; see also Sahih al-Jami, 6970). The rule is that everything which we are forbidden to kill, we are not allowed to eat; if we are allowed to eat it we are allowed to kill it. Some scholars exclude sea snakes, but the correct view is that as they live nowhere except in the water, we are permitted to eat them, because of the general nature of the ayah (interpretation of the meaning): Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food  for the benefit of yourselves  [al-Maidah 5:96] 3- Otters and turtles: The correct view is that to be on the safe side, it is permissible to eat them after slaughtering them properly, because they live both on land and in the sea. Here the rule is that in the case of animals that live both on land and in the sea, the rules concerning land animals should be given precedence, to be on the safe side, so they must be slaughtered properly, except for crabs which do not need to be slaughtered, even though they live both on land and in the sea, because they do not have blood. Everything that can cause harm is forbidden as food, even if it comes from the sea, because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):  And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allah is Most Merciful to you. [al-Nisa 4:29] and:  and do not throw yourselves into destruction [al-Baqarah 2:195] (See al-Mughni, 11/83; Hashiyah al-Rawd, 7/430; Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 3/197; and Ahkam al-Atimah by al-Fawzan).

    <title>Trees mentioned in the Quraan and Sunnah</title>
    <question>As salaamo alaikum wa rahmatullah wa barakatahu

Could you please give me some Hadith references and Quranic references to the Following:

Tuba tree
Tree of Life
Tree of Knowledge
The Cosmic Tree
The Fartherest Tree of the Heavens
These trees are mentioned in muslim literature and I am looking for their credibility
Jazak Allah Khairun</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. A number of trees are mentioned in the Quraan and Sunnah, some of which will be discussed below: The date palm tree This is a good tree to which Allaah likened the word of Tawheed when it is established in the sincere heart, where it bears fruits of good deeds that strengthen eemaan (faith). Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;See you not how Allaah sets forth a parable?  A goodly word is as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the sky (i.e., very high).&quot; [Ibraaheem 14:24] This is the tree to which Allaah likens the believer because it is good in all aspects, it is lasting and it offers different kinds of benefit. Ibn Umar reported: &quot;The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: There is a kind of tree whose leaves do not fall and it is like the Muslim. Tell me what it is. The people mentioned different kinds of desert trees  and I said to myself, It is the date palm tree, but I felt too shy to speak up. Then the people said, Tell us what it is, O Messenger of Allaah. He said: It is the date palm tree.&quot; (al-Bukhaari, 60) The blessed olive tree the purity of which Allaah set forth as a parable Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Allaah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a niche and within it a lamp, the lamp is in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east (i.e., it neither gets sun-rays only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e., nor does it get sun-rays only in the afternoon  but it is exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil would almost glow forth (of itself), though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allaah guides to His Light whom He wills. And Allaah sets forth parables for mankind, and Allaah is All-Knower of everything.&quot; [al-Noor 24:35] In Soorat al-Muminoon, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And a tree (olive) that springs forth from Mount Sinai, that grows oil, and (it is a) relish for the eaters.&quot; [al-Muminoon 23:20] Abu Aseed said: &quot;The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Eat the oil and use it on your hair and skin, for it comes from a blessed tree.&quot; (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1775; see also Saheeh al-Jaami) The tree which Allaah caused to grow for Yoonus (upon whom be peace) for food and healing. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And, verily, Yoonus was one of the Messengers  Then a (big) fish swallowed him and he had done an act worthy of blame. Had he not been of those who glorify Allaah, he would have indeed remained inside its belly until the Day of Resurrection. But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick, and We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him.&quot; [al-Saaffaat 37:139, 142-146] The mufassireen (commentators) said: The gourd (al-yaqteen) is a kind of pumpkin. Some of them described the benefits of the pumpkin, such as: it grows quickly, it provides shade, it has large, smooth leaves, it keeps flies away and its fruit provides good nourishment: it can be eaten raw or cooked, and its skin may be eaten too. It is known that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) liked this kind of pumpkin and used to look for it on the plate of food. (Tafseer Ibn Katheer). The great tree in heaven where our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw his father Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace) Samurah ibn Jundub reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, describing his vision: &quot;Then we went up until we reached a green garden, in which there was a great tree, with an old man and children at its base, and another man near the tree, trying to light a fire in front of him. They took me up to that tree and into a house; I have never seen any more beautiful than that house. In it there were men, old men, youths, women and children. Then they brought me out and took me up to the tree and into another house, even better than the first one. In this house there were old and young men. I said: You have shown me around tonight; tell me about what I have seen. They said, Yes the old man at the foot of the tree was Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace), and the children around him were the children of mankind&quot; (al-Bukhaari, 1270). Sidrat al-Muntaha, by which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw Jibreel when he was taken up into the heavens Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And indeed he (Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw him (Jibreel) at a second descent (i.e., another time), near Sidrat al-Muntaha (the lote tree of the utmost boundary, beyond which none can pass), near it is the Paradise of Abode, when that covered the lote-tree which did cover it! The sight (of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)) turned not aside (right or left), nor did it transgress beyond (the) limit (ordained for it). Indeed, he did see of the Greatest Signs of his Lord (Allaah).&quot; [al-Najm 53:13-18] The phrase translated here as &quot;when that covered the lote-tree which did cover it&quot; is explained by the hadeeth narrated by Imaam al-Bukhaari from Abu Dharr, in which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;It was covered in colours, I do not know what they are&quot; According to a hadeeth narrated by Abu Saeed and Ibn Abbaas, he said: &quot;It was covered by the angels.&quot; According to a report narrated by Muslim, he said: &quot;When it was covered with whatever covered it by the command of Allaah, it changed, and none of the creation of Allaah could describe its beauty.&quot; In the famous hadeeth about his Miraaj (ascent into heaven), the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said that when Jibreel took him up into the heavens, he went through from one heaven to the next by the command of Allaah, until he reached the seventh heaven. He said: &quot;Then I was taken to Sidrat al-Muntaha; its fruits were like the pitchers of Hajar and its leaves were like the ears of elephants. He said, This is Sidrat al-Muntaha&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 3598). The reason why it is called Sidrat al-Muntaha is stated in the hadeeth narrated from Ibn Masood by Imaam Muslim: &quot;There everything that comes up from earth stops (yantahee), and it is taken from there, and there everything that comes down stops, and it is taken from there.&quot; Al-Nawawi said: It is called Sidrat al-Muntaha because the knowledge of the angels stops at that point, and no one has gone beyond it except the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). It is the tree at which the knowledge of every Prophet who has been sent and every angel who is near to Allaah stops. What lies beyond it is unseen; no one knows it except Allaah or the one to whom He tells it. It was said that this is the ultimate destination of the souls of the martyrs. The fruits described in the hadeeth are well known: they are the fruits of the lotus tree. Al-Khattaabi said that the phrase &quot;like the pitchers of Hajar&quot; meant that they were big like pitchers; this is something that was known to the first listeners, which is why this analogy was used. Hajar is a place-name. The phrase &quot;its leaves were like the ears of elephants&quot; is also indicative of huge size. The Tree of Tooba in Paradise Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;In Paradise there is a tree in whose shade a rider could travel for a hundred years without crossing it. Recite, if you wish: In shade long-extended [al-Waaqiah 56:30]&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4502) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Tooba is a tree in Paradise, one hundred years big. The clothes of the people of Paradise are made from its calyces (outer casing of its flowers).&quot; (Reported by Ibn Hibbaan; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 3918) Utbah ibn Abdin al-Salami said: &quot;A Bedouin came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him about al-Hawd (the cistern). He mentioned Paradise, then the Bedouin asked him, Is there fruit there? He said, Yes, and there is a tree called Tooba. The Bedouin asked, What tree of this world does it resemble? He said, It does not resemble any tree of your land. Have you been to Syria? He said, No. He said, It resembles a tree in Syria called al-Jawzah (walnut) which grows on one trunk then spreads its branches higher up. The Bedouin asked, How big is its trunk? He said, If one of the camels of your people was to go around it, it would not complete one circuit before its neck broke of old age and exhaustion. The Bedouin asked, Are there grapes there? He said, Yes. He asked, How big is a bunch? He said, The distance a crow could fly without stopping in a month. He asked, How big is one grape? He said, Does your father ever slaughter a he-goat from his flocks? He said, Yes. He said, And does he skin it and give the hide to your mother, and say, &quot;Make me a bucket&quot;? He said, Yes. The Bedouin asked, Is one grape big enough to satisfy me and my family? He said, Yes, and your whole tribe.&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad). The tree of Zaqqoom, which is the food of the people of Hell This tree is described in the Quraan as (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; the accursed tree (mentioned) in the Quraan&quot; [al-Israa 17:60]. Allaah also says about it (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Then, moreover, verily, - you the erring-ones, the deniers (of Resurrection)! You verily will eat of the trees of Zaqqoom. Then you will fill your bellies therewith, and drink boiling water on top of it, so you will drink (that) like thirsty camels! That will be their entertainment on the Day of Recompense!&quot; [al-Waaqiah 56:51-56] &quot;Verily, the tree of Zaqqoom, will be the food of the sinners, like boiling oil, it will boil in the bellies, like the boiling of scalding water. (It will be said): Seize him and drag him into the midst of blazing Fire, then pour over his head the torment of boiling water, taste you (this)! Verily, you were (pretending to be the mighty, the generous! Verily! This is that whereof you used to doubt!&quot; [al-Dukhaan 44:43-50] &quot;Is that (Paradise) better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqoom (a horrible tree in Hell)? Truly We have made it (as) a trial for the Zaalimoon (polytheists, disbelievers, wrongdoers, etc.). Verily, it is a tree that springs out of the bottom of Hell-fire, the shoots of its fruit-stalks are like the heads of shayaateen (devils); truly they will eat thereof and fill their bellies therewith. Then on the top of that they will be given boiling water to drink so that it becomes a mixture (of boiling water and Zaqqoom in their bellies). Then, thereafter, their return is to the flaming fire of Hell.&quot; [al-Saafaat 37:62-68] The tree under which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted his Companions pledge of allegiance unto death and not to desert him. This happened during the campaign of al-Hudaybiyah, when he heard of the betrayal of the mushrikeen. This tree is also mentioned in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Indeed, Allaah was pleased with the believers when they gave the Bayah (pledge) to you (O Muhammad) under the tree&quot; [al-Fath 48:18] The tree next to which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to preach Jaabir ibn Abdullaah (may Allaah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to go and stand next to a tree or palm-tree on Fridays. A woman or a man of the Ansaar said: &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, should we not make for you a minbar (&quot;pulpit&quot;)?&quot; He said, &quot;If you wish.&quot; So they made a minbar for him, and when the next Friday came, he was shown to the minbar. The tree cried like a small child, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came down and hugged the crying tree until it calmed down.&quot; Jaabir said: &quot;It was crying because of the dhikr (remembrance of Allaah) that it used to hear.&quot; (al-Bukhaari, 3319). The tree from which Allaah spoke to Moosa (upon whom be peace) and sent him as a Prophet Allaah says in the Quraan (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;So when he reached it (the fire), he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed place from the tree: O Moosa! Verily! I am Allaah, the Lord of the Aalameen (mankind, jinns and all that exists)!&quot; [al-Qasas 28:30] The tree from which Allaah forbade our father and mother (Aadam and Hawwa) to eat Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both wish, but approach not this tree, otherwise you both will be of the Zaalimoon (unjust and wrong-doers).&quot; [al-Araaf 7:19] &quot;Then Shaytaan whispered to him, saying: O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?&quot; [Ta-Ha 20:120] &quot;So He misled them with deception. Then when they tasted of the tree, that which was hidden from them of their shame (private parts) became manifest to them and they began to stick together the leaves of Paradise over themselves (in order to cover their shame). And their Lord called out to them (saying): Did I not forbid you that tree and tell you: Verily Shaytaan is an open enemy to you?&quot; [al-Araaf 7:22] The cedar tree to which Allaah likened the kaafir (disbeliever) Abu Hurayrah said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The example of the believer is like that of a plant which is continually bent over by the wind; the believer is continually beset with afflictions. The example of a hypocrite is like that of the cedar tree, which does not yield until it is uprooted in one go.&quot; (Muslim, 5024) The scholars of Arabic language said: the cedar (al-arz) is a tree similar to the stone pine tree, which grows in Syria and Armenia. According to another report, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;The example of the kaafir is that of the firmly-rooted cedar which does not yield to anything until it is uprooted in one go.&quot; The scholars said: The meaning of this hadeeth is that the believer suffers a great deal, in his physical health, with his family and with his wealth, but this is an expiation for his sins and will raise his status. The kaafir, however, suffers little, but even if something happens to him it will not expiate for his sins at all; he will come with a full burden of sin on the Day of Resurrection. The tree in the righteous vision that was narrated concerning the sajdah (prostration) to be performed when reciting certain aayaat of the Quraan Ibn Abbaas said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said: &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, last night I had a dream in which it was as if I was praying behind a tree. I prostrated and the tree prostrated after me. I heard it saying: Allaahumma uktub li bihaa indaka ajran wada anni bihaa wizran wajalhaa li indaka dhukhran wa taqabbalha minni kamaa taqabbaltahaa min abdika Daawood (O Allaah, record for me because of it (the sajdah) a reward, alleviate some of my burden, and make it an investment on my behalf with You. Accept it from me as You accepted it from Your slave Daawood).&quot; Ibn Abbaas said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) recited an aayah where a sajdah is required, then he prostrated, and I heard him saying the same words that the man had reported that the tree had said. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 528) The two trees which came together to conceal the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) when he was answering the call of nature This was recorded in the saheeh report narrated by Imaam Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, from Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him): &quot; We stopped in a fragrant valley, and the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) wanted to answer the call of nature. I followed him, bringing a bottle of water, but he could not find anywhere where he could conceal himself. There were two trees at the edge of the valley, so the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to one of them, took hold of one of its branches, and said: Follow me, by the permission of Allaah. So it followed him like a camel being led by a rope, until he came to the other tree. He took one of the other trees branches and said: Follow me, by the permission of Allaah. So it followed him until he reached the halfway point between them, then he put them together and said: Stay together and cover me, by the permission of Allaah. So they stayed together.&quot; Jaabir said: &quot;I kept away, for fear that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) might feel my presence and move even further away. So I sat down, thinking to myself, and when I turned around, I saw the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) coming towards me, and the two trees had separated and taken up their former positions.&quot; (Saheeh Muslim, 5328) Trees (plants) with foul-smelling &quot;fruits&quot; after eating which the Muslims are forbidden to come to the mosque Jaabir said: &quot;The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever eats of these vegetables (the first time he said garlic, then garlic, onions and leeks), let him not come near us in our mosques, for the angels will be offended by whatever offends the people.&quot; (al-Nisaai, 700) The trees (all except the gharqad) which will show the Jews to the Muslims so that they may kill them during the great battle at the end of time The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;The Hour will not come until the Muslims fight the Jews and kill them. The Jews will hide behind rocks and trees, and the rocks and trees will say: O Muslim, O slave of Allaah! There is a Jews behind me, come and kill him! (All the trees will say this except for the gharqad (box-thorn), for it is one of the trees of the Jews.&quot; (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; it is a saheeh hadeeth). These are a number of the trees mentioned in the Quraan and Sunnah, from which we may learn many lessons. We ask Allaah to help us benefit from these lessons. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on eating raw meat</title>
    <question>My question is that in some cultures people are found of eating raw meat. I would like to know if there is any Islamic rulings on that? Meaning wether it is ok or not.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Some scholars said that it is disliked to eat raw meat, but the correct view is that it is permissible, on the basis of the principle that all things are permitted except those which have been expressly forbidden. There is no evidence to suggest that this is forbidden, but it is allowed on the condition that no harm is caused to the person who eats it  in which case it would not be allowed, because everything that causes harm is haraam, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  and do not throw yourselves into destruction [al-Baqarah 2:195]. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Wife not interested in intercourse</title>
    <question>I've married 4 years ago, and I have a 3 years old
 daughter. My wife is not interested in sex at all. We've tried several doctors
 but [with] no progress. I do masturbate a lot, which caused some bad effects but I
 can't stop as we live in Canada, where you can't marry more than one wife. Is this a
 good reason to marry a second wife, or is there any other solution to my problem?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Arabic Answer in audio: Real Audio format -- Press here to play (To download player, click on icon: ) English translation: , and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger. I ask Allaah to help you, my brother, to cope with this problem which you are suffering from, and which has to do with the mother of your daughter, the closest of people to you. I would like to make three points to you: You are permitted to enjoy your wife in any of the ways which Allaah has permitted to you. This includes masturbation by her hand. The reason you have mentioned in your question is sufficient grounds for taking another wife. If you can find no other solution to this problem except divorcing this woman, between whom and you there is no longer any relationship in the marital bed, and marrying another woman afterwards, there is nothing wrong with that, in shaa' Allaah. You should consult the brothers around you who know your situation, and seek the guidance of Allaah by praying istikhaarah. May Allaah guide you to the right way. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Emission of semen due to illness does not require ghusl</title>
    <question>I understand one of the causes that make ghusl a must are:
1. The emission of semen, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;What requires water (ghusl) is if you see water (i.e., semen) coming out of you.&quot; (Reported by Muslim, no. 1/269) .
My question is: like my case sometimes I see semen emitting with my urine and I confirmed that it is a semen as recently I have done a medical check and found trace of semen in my urine. Is it compulsory for me to perform ghusl when I see semen emit with my urine?
I am really appericiate this website because a lot of the questions
and answers make me more convinced to practice Islam in my life.
Thank you very much</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. The emission of semen due to enjoyment or a &quot;wet dream&quot; requires ghusl, but if semen is emitted in the urine or because of sickness, with no pleasure involved, this does not require ghusl. All you have to do is clean yourself properly after passing urine or stools, and perform wudoo before praying. This is sufficient, Al-hamdu-lillaah.</answer>

    <title>Doubts of one who is interested in Islam</title>
    <question>I am a non-Muslim who is very much interested in Islam. I have been trying to do research on my own.
However, I came upon some information that I found rather disturbing.
It is regarding the Kaaba and the origin of Islam. I was told that Abraham and Ishmael removed all the idols from the Kaaba, but there was one in particular who's name meant &quot;diety&quot;. I read that this is where the name &quot;Allah&quot; came from and that this diety was the pagan Moon god.
His symbol is the crescent moon and Ramadhan is scheduled around lunar activity. I would like an answer to whether or not such a religion existed and is Islam really connected to this pagan practice?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Welcome to a lady who is seeking the true religion and is interested in Islam. We ask Allaah to show you the truth and help you to follow it, and to protect you from Shaytaan and his doubts, and the misguidance of the enemies of Islam. Before I answer your question, I would like to remind you that the way to find out the truth about a religion is to refer to its authentic sources, which in the case of Islam means the Quraan, which is the Word of Allaah, and the Sunnah, which is the words of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), to whom Allaah sent Revelation. One of the mistakes made by some of those who investigate Islam is to refer to sources that are not authentic or material written by those who have ulterior motives and who are enemies of Islam spreading lies about it, to put people off and lead them astray from the Way of Allaah. Turning to your question about the Kabah, and Ibraaheem and Ismaaeel (upon whom be peace), it is very strange to say that they removed all the idols from the Kabah except one. This contradicts the historical facts, and does not make sense, because it is known that Ibraaheem and Ismaaeel were the ones who built the Kabah, on the command of Allaah how could they then have taken idols out of it? How could there have been any idols in it when they were supervising its construction and maintenance by remembering Allaah and calling people to perform Tawaaf around it and come on pilgrimage to it only for the sake of Allaah? The idols came many years afterwards, when some of the Arabs travelled to the kaafir lands outside the Arabian Peninsula and brought back idols, some of which were placed around the Kabah. Then the mushrikeen added more idols until there were 360 of them around the Kabah. This remained the case until Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). This was the dawning of the light of Tawheed which drove out the darkness of idolatry. Through him, Allaah defeated the mushrikeen; he broke the idols and purified the Sacred House, thus restoring the Kabah to the pure worship of the One God, as it had been at the time of his forefather Ibraaheem, the Friend (Khaleel) of Allaah. There follows an account of the building of the Ancient House, from the Quraan and the Ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). We will begin by quoting from the Quraan, where Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;And (remember) when Ibraaheem said: My Lord, make this city (Makkah) a place of security and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in Allaah and the Last Day. He (Allaah) answered, As for him who disbelieves, I shall leave him in contentment for a while, then I shall compel him to the torment of the Fire, and worst indeed is that destination! And (remember) when Ibraaheem and (his son) Ismaaeel were raising the foundations of the House (the Kabah), (saying): Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. Our Lord! And make us submissive unto You and of our offspring a nation submissive unto You, and show us our manaasik (all the ceremonies of pilgrimage Hajj and Umrah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One Who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful. Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them Your Verses and instruct them in the Book and al-Hikmah (full knowledge of the Islamic laws and jurisprudence or wisdom or Prophethood, etc.), and sanctify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&quot; [al-Baqarah 2:126-129] &quot;And (remember) when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the (Sacred) House, (saying): Associate not anything (in worship) with Me, and sanctify My House for those who circumambulate it, and those who stand up for prayer, and those who bow (submit themselves with humility and obedience to Allaah), and make prostration (in prayer, etc.) And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage). They will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, they will come from every deep and distant (wide) mountain highway (to perform Hajj).&quot; [al-Hajj 22:26-27] As regards the story of the construction of the Kabah in the Sunnah, Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated the story of Haajar, the wife of Ibraaheem and the mother of his son Ismaaeel. In his report, he said: &quot; Ibraaheem brought her and her son Ismaaeel, while she was still breast-feeding him, and left them in a place near the Kabah (meaning near the place where the Kabah was later built) under a tree on the spot of Zamzam (meaning the place where Zamzam later appeared), at the highest place in the mosque. In those days there was no-one in Makkah nor was there any water. So he left them there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a water-skin containing some water, then he set off for home. Ismaaeels mother followed him and said: O Ibraaheem, where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)? She said this many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him, Has Allaah commanded you to do this? He said, Yes. She said, Then He will not forsake us, and returned, while Ibraaheem went on his way. When he reached al-Thaaniyah, where they could not see him, he turned to face the Kabah, raised his hands and offered the supplication: O Our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in an uncultivable valley, by Your Sacred House in order, O Our Lord, that they may perform al-Salaat (iqaamat al-salaat), so fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allaah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks. [Ibraaheem 14:37] Ismaaeels mother went on suckling Ismaaeel and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him tossing in agony; she left him because she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of al-Safaa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from al-Safaa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the mountain of al-Marwa, where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between al-Safaa and al-Marwa) seven times.&quot; Ibn Abbaas said: &quot;The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: This is the origin of the tradition of al-Saee (the walking) of people between them (al-Safaa and al-Marwa). When she reached al-Marwa (for the last time), she heard a voice and she made herself quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, O (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me? And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hands in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water from her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&quot; The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: &quot;May Allaah bestow mercy on Ismaaeels mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&quot; The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further added: &quot;Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angels said to her: Dont be afraid of being forsaken, for this is the House of Allaah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allaah never forsakes His people. The House at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way until some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kadaa. They stopped and stayed in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, This bird must be flying around water, although we know that there is no water in this valley. They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them about it. So, they all came (towards the water).&quot; The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: &quot;Ismaaeels mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, Do you allow us to stay with you? She replied, Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water. They agreed to that.&quot; The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) further added: &quot;Ismaaeels mother was pleased with the whole situation, as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (Ismaaeel) grew up and learnt Arabic from them, and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up. When he reached the age of puberty, they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ismaaeels mother had died, Ibraaheem came after Ismaaeels marriage in order to see his family that he had left before Then Ibraaheem came and saw Ismaaeel under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibraaheem, he stood up to welcome him and they greeted one another as a father greets his son or a son greets his father. Ibraaheem said, O Ismaaeel, Allaah has given me an order. Ismaaeel said: Do what your Lord has ordered you to do. Ibraaheem asked, Will you help me? Ismaaeel said, I will help you. Ibraaheem said, Allaah has ordered me to build a house here, pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.&quot; The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added: &quot;Then they raised the foundations of the House (Kabah). Ismaaeel brought the stones and Ibraaheem was building, and when the walls became high, Ismaaeel brought this stone and put it for Ibraaheem, who stood on it and carried on building, while Ismaaeel was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying: Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. [al-Baqarah 2:127]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) added, &quot;Then both of them went on building and going around the Kabah saying, Our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily! You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.&quot; (Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 3113) Having outlined the historical details of the building of the Kabah, we move on to the idea mentioned in your question that the name of Allaah was derived from the name of an idol. This is an extremely odd idea. How can the name of the Creator, the Evolver, the First, the Almighty, the Compellor be derived from the name of a created idol that could neither benefit nor harm anyone? Allaah says, rebuking the mushrikeen (polytheists) (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Yet they have taken besides Him other gods that created nothing but are themselves created, and possess neither hurt nor benefit for themselves, and possess no power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead.&quot; [al-Furqaan 25:3] &quot;You worship besides Allaah only idols, and you only invent falsehood. Verily, those whom you worship besides Allaah have no power to give you provision, so seek your provision from Allaah (Alone), and worship Him (Alone), and be grateful to Him. To Him (Alone) you will be brought back.&quot; [al-Ankaboot 29:17] Allaah describes how Ibraaheem (upon whom be peace) rebuked his father and his people for worshipping idols (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;When he said to his father: O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything?&quot; [Maryam 19:42] &quot;And recite to them the story of Ibraaheem, when he said to his father and his people: What do you worship? They said: We worship idols, and to them we are ever devoted. He said, Do they hear you, when you call (on them)? Or do they benefit you or do they harm (you)? They said, Nay, but we found our fathers doing so. He said, Do you observe that which you have been worshipping, - you and your ancient fathers? Verily! They are enemies to me, save the Lord of the Aalameen (makind, jinn and everything that exists), Who has created me, and it is He Who guides me.&quot; [Al-Shuaraa 26:69-78] Concerning Ibraaheems destruction of his peoples idols, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Then he turned to their gods and said, Will you not eat (of the offering before you)? What is the matter with you that you speak not? Then he turned upon them, striking (them) with (his) right hand. Then they (the worshippers of idols) came towards him, hastening. He said, Worship you that which you (yourselves) carve? While Allaah has created you and what you make?&quot; [al-Saaffaat 37:91-96] After reading all this, how can it be said that Ibraaheem left one idol near the Kabah, and that the name of Allaah is derived from the name of an idol? Do you know what &quot;Allaah&quot; means and where this name is derived from? The blessed name &quot;Allaah&quot; is derived from the Arabic verb alaha/yalahu/malooh [the root of which is the three letters alif, laam, haa]. This verb includes the meaning of love as well as worship. Allaah, may He be glorified and exalted, is the One Who is loved, glorified and feared by the believers, and they put their hope in Him. As regards to your last question, about whether Islam has anything to do with the worship of idols or heavenly bodies, this is a strange matter indeed. Islam proclaimed the absolute unity of Allaah (Tawheed) and taught that He Alone is to be worshipped, with no partners or associates. Islam came to fight idolatry and put an end to it, so how can it possibly be connected to idol-worship? Perhaps you have read in the Quraan the story of the hoopoe who believed only in Allaah; he knew Who his Lord was, and denounced the worship of stars and planets. Allaah says, relating how His Prophet Sulaymaan (upon whom be peace) conveyed the story to the queen of Yemen at that time (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;[The hoopoe said] and I have come to you from Saba (Sheba) with true news. I found a woman ruling over them, and she has been given all things that could be possessed by any ruler of the earth, and she has a great throne. I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allaah, and Shaytaan has made their deeds fair-seeming to them, and has barred them from (Allaahs) Way, so they have no guidance, so that they do not worship (prostrate before) Allaah, Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knows what you conceal and what you reveal. Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!&quot; [al-Naml 27:22-26] There is also the story of how Ibraaheem rebuked his people for worshipping heavenly bodies, the sun and moon, which Allaah has told us in Soorat al-Anaam (the sixth soorah). The fast of Ramadaan is not connected to the moon because we worship the moon, but because the Lord of the moon has made it a marker of time for us, by which we may organize our worship and other affairs. So we look for the new moon of Ramadaan so that we may worship Allaah Alone by fasting, and we look for the new moon of the following month to mark the end of this annual act of worship. We also look for the timings of Hajj and other acts of worship in a similar way. We hope that this has helped you understand anything that was not clear to you before. Note that this is a serious issue, and it is not something to be taken lightly. The only religion with Allaah is Islam, which He has chosen for His slaves, and He will not accept any other religion. Come and join the religion of truth, and follow what your Lord has revealed.</answer>

    <title>Halaal food mixed with haraam</title>
    <question>Asalamu Alaikum,
, by Allah's (swt) Grace and Mercy I have recently begun practicing Islam, may Allah bless you for establishing a light on the Internet when there is so much darkness and evil present on it.
I am a little confused about what foods are haram/halal. What to do when 'people of the book' offer meat (besides pork) to us? Also, I have heard that certain ingredients in food may be derived from animals, such as mono- and diglycerides, lecithin, gelatin, etc. Are these permissible to eat?
As well, I have heard certain chocolate bars have trace amounts of alcohol in them. But they are so small that there is no way of being even slightly intoxicated from them.
Please clarify these issues, Allah-willing.
Jazak-Allah</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Who has guided you to follow His laws and religion. We ask Allaah to give you and us even more of His Bounty. In response to your question, there is nothing wrong with eating any halaal food offered to us by the People of the Book, so long as it is not mixed with haraam like pork and so on. As regards sweets that contain unchanged alcohol, we are not permitted to eat them, whether the alcohol in them is in big amounts or only a little. The answer to the remainder of your question may be found under question #210 . And Allaah is the Source of help.</answer>

    <title>Wife and Husband's Brother</title>
    <question>Assalaamu'alaikum! Ya Sheikh, I have a very important question to ask you and this will Insha'Allah benefit many other Muslims. A friend of mine was telling me that a wife cannot come in front of the husband's brother as he is not her Mahram. My question is this: I live with my parents and brother and sister. I and my brother pay the rent of the apartment. Insha'Allah we are going to move to a rented house which will be bigger and the rent will be payed by me and my brother. I had thought of getting married because of the bigger house, but I don't know whether I could do this now unless I get my own separate house. Please answer my question as soon as possible, Jazakumulah Khyran</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah. There is no harm in you and your wife living in one house with the rest of the family members you mentioned. All that you have to be careful about is that your wife does not go out in front of your brother or be alone with him in the house, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade non-mahrams (unrelated men) to enter upon women. He said: &quot;Beware of entering upon women.&quot; One of the Sahaabah said to him, &quot;O Messenger of Allaah, what about the brother-in-law?&quot; He said: &quot;The brother-in-law is death!&quot; (Reported by al-Bukhaari, Fath al-Baari, 9/330). Al-Nawawi, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: &quot;What is referred to in the hadeeth is all the husbands (male) relatives apart from his father and sons. People customarily take the matter of a man being alone with his brothers wife as being of little consequence; to indicate the seriousness of the matter, it was likened to death. Indeed, one should be more cautious about the brother-in-law than about a stranger. The phrase &quot;the brother-in-law is death&quot; may have a number of meanings: That being alone with a brother-in-law may lead to disaster if a sin is committed, or may spell divorce for the woman if her husband cannot contain his jealousy; Or: Beware of being alone with a non-mahram woman fear this as you fear death. All this stems from Islams keenness to protect households, to avoid evil and to preserve marriages in the best possible way. You will find more details under question #217 . May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Taking a family name other than that of ones father (or attributing oneself to someone other than ones father)</title>
    <question>A woman before becoming Muslim changed her last name from her family name to her husband's. Now that she is Muslim, she is no longer married to that man. Also, she would like to formally change her name to a Muslim name to affirm her Islamic identity. She would like to also change her last name back to her family name, however, she would like to adopt her mother's maiden name (maternal grand-father's name) instead of her father's name, since there is some conflict between them, and that she said he did not have much to do with her upbringing. Is it permissible for her to take her mother's maiden name?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. This womans desire to take an Islamic name and to change her family name from that of her former husband is quite correct, but it is not permissible for her to call herself after anyone except her legitimate father no matter what the reasons for wishing to do so. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot;Call them (adopted sons) by the names of their fathers&quot; [al-Ahzaab 33:5]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Whoever calls himself by other than his fathers name (or attributes himself to someone other than his father), will be cursed by Allaah, the angels and all the people.&quot; (Reported by Ibn Maajah, 2599; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 6104). And Allaah is the Source of help.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on making    bets in matters of shari knowledge</title>
    <question>Some students of shari knowledge make a kind of bet whereby the one who is wrong (on a given issue) has to buy a book, for example, for the one who gets it right. Is this halaal?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.This is a competition, and Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allaah have mercy on him) thought that there was nothing wrong with competitions on issue of shareeah. He explained this by pointing out that jihaad may be either with knowledge or with weapons. He also used as evidence the reports about Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) when the aayah (interpretation of the meaning) Alif-Laam-Meem. The Romans have been defeated in the nearer land (Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Palestine), and they, after their defeat, will be victorious, within three to nine years [al-Room 30:1-4] was revealed. The Persians were the ones who had defeated the Romans; the Romans were Christians, People of the Book, whilst the Persians were Magians (Zoroastrians), who had no revealed Book. Allaah said (interpretation of the meaning):  And on that day, the believers (i.e., Muslims) will rejoice (at the victory given by Allaah to the Romans against the Persians). [al-Room 30:4], because the believers wanted the Christians to defeat the Persians as the Christians were People of the Book and therefore closer to Islam than the Magians. Quraysh, on the other hand, wanted the Magians to defeat the Romans, and said, The Romans cannot defeat the Persians, because the Persians are stronger than they are, and they do not believe in the Quraan. So Abu Bakr bet them a number of camels that (the Romans) would prevail within seven years. The seven years passed and nothing had happened. Abu Bakr (may Allaah be pleased with him) went to the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who told him, Add two years, and increase the bet (reported by Ibn Jareer in his Tafseer, 10/165, 166, no. 27876)  because the word bid used in the aayah refers to any number between three and nine. So the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him to play it safe by increasing the time period and increasing the prize. Abu Bakr did this, and before the two years had passed, travellers brought news that the Romans had defeated the Persians. From this report Shaykh al-Islam deduced that it is permissible to bet in matters of shari knowledge.</answer>

If people can be encouraged to observe naafilah fasts through words, then this is sufficient and there is no need to do so through deeds.</answer>

    <title>Teaching Children About Unwanted Hair</title>
    <question>My question is in reference to the sunnah (prophetic guidance) of shaving the underarms and the pubic region. At what age should we instill this practice with our children who may have reached the stage of puberty? May Allah guide us in seeking this knowledge in Islam.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.The child  male or female  needs to know about this ruling when he or she approaches the age of puberty and when you think that this hair, which has been made one of the signs of puberty, and which we have been commanded to remove for the sake of tahaarah (purity), cleanliness and good health, has started to grow. You could introduce this idea gradually in the context of other points and ideas that the child needs to know and be reminded of as he or she approaches the age of puberty, such as the meaning of takleef (accountability), the rights of Allaah over a person, the duties of the person who has reached the age of accountability, the fact that his or her evil deeds will be recorded from puberty onwards, and the rules of ghusl for janaabah (bathing for impurity), etc. If the parents find it embarrassing to talk about this subject directly with the child, they can give him or her a book or pamphlet about the rules that have to do with puberty. And Allaah is the source of strength.</answer>

    <title>Helping sinful neighbours</title>
    <question>Assalamu'alaykum
In my neighborhood there are many needy people. My question is if they request me for some money which alhamdulillah I have right now, can I give it to them knowing that they will not only use it to buy food but also drugs and alcohol? Some of these needy people are Muslims also.
Some people say that I should not give them any money until I have proof that they are not buying anything illegal or haraam. Others say that I should keep giving them money but calmly give them a little da'wah. May Allah most high reward you for your answer.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. You can buy things they need, such as food, clothing and so on, or you can let them buy things that are permissible, and pay the bill for them, whilst continuing to advise them, warn them, and call them to Islam, because your neighbours rights over you are great indeed. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: &quot;Jibreel kept advising me of the rights of neighbours so much that I thought he would make them my heirs.&quot; (Agreed upon). And Allaah is the Source of help.</answer>

    <question>Can you pay zakat before its due date? Assume it is due in July , and you decide to give it in April or portions of it in may.
Thank you...</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. Yes, it is permissible to pay zakaat before its due date, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) accepted two years zakaat in advance from al-Abbaas ibn Abd al-Muttalib. But we should remember here that the annual payment of zakaat is worked out according to the Hijri (Islamic) calendar, and not the Gregorian (western) calendar  the difference between them is well known.</answer>

    <title>Ruling on aborting a deformed fetus</title>
    <question>If a fetus is found to have some defects (at about 4.5 months of pregrancy), one which includes anencephaly:no brain, and the doctors strongly suggest an abortion since the longest an anencephalic born baby survived was 21 days and since most of such pregnancies end up in miscarriages at a later and riskier stage of pregnancies, or still born baby. what is a muslim couple to do? especially since consulting two knowledgeable islamic scholars each came up with a different solution ie one suggesting abortion the other one suggesting continuing with pregnancy. The couple had to make a decision the soonest possible. what do the laws of islam say?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. If the fetus has reached the age of four months, then the soul has already been breathed into it, so deliberately aborting it would be regarded as killing a soul - which is a very grave major sin. The doctors' opinion that it is malformed is no excuse at all. If it is miscarried or stillborn, or it is born alive and dies shortly thereafter, the parents will be rewarded for bearing the calamity of their loss, and if it lives and has some kind of disability, they will be rewarded for their patience in taking care of it. Everything that happens to the believer is good for him, but wilfully destroying a soul is nothing but evil and sin. We must also take into consideration the errors that may occur in doctors' reports, and that fact that the condition of the fetus may change and improve. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Are Earrings Haram for Men?</title>
    <question>In the basis of our religion, is it okay for men to wear earrings (whether that being one or several)? Is it okay for men to wear jewelry which is silver and not gold? I hope that this is not a silly question because a lot of the Muslim men that I associate with wear earrings. Some people say that the members of the Prophet's tribe - the Quraysh used to wear earrings in the old days and that is why it is okay for us. Could you please find out if this is true and give me a definite answer? Thank you very much!</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Are earnings haram in Islam? Can men wear silver rings? The prohibition to imitate non-Muslims Praise be to Allah.Are earnings haram in Islam? Earrings and bracelets are forms of adornment for women. Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who make themselves look like women and women who make themselves look like men . (Al-Bukhari, 5435) Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) cursed men who wear womens clothes and women who wear mens clothes. (Reported by Abu Dawud in al-Sunan, Kitab al-Libas, Bab fi libas al-nisa) On this basis, it is not permitted for men to wear earrings or nose-rings. The claim that this is permissible because the people of Quraysh used to do that needs to be proven, in the first place, and where is the proof? Even if they used to do this in the Jahiliyyah (Time of Ignorance before Islam), Islam came and forbade men to wear the adornment of women or to make themselves look like them, as is clear from the hadiths quoted above. What matters is the ruling of Islam, not what Quraysh or other tribes may have done. The kinds of female adornment known among Quraysh and others include earrings, bracelets, anklets and bangles worn on the upper arm. The point is that these are known as forms of womens adornment since ancient times. Can men wear silver rings? Islam has given men sufficient scope to adorn themselves by allowing them to wear silver rings . Ibn Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) wore a ring made of silver, and the people did likewise. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 5417) Islam also allows men to wear gold and silver when necessary to replace a lost tooth or nose, and so on. The prohibition to imitate non-Muslims We would say that any Muslim man who wears jewellery is making himself look like the disbeliever , because this is known to be their style of adornment. The latest fashion among them is to wear earrings and the like in their ears, noses , lips, cheeks and other parts of the body (so-called body-piercing ). The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: Whoever imitates a people is one of them. (Reported by Abu Dawud, al-Sunan, Kitab al-libas, Bab libas al-shuhrah). Whoever does this should repent to Allah and not engage in the futile defence of falsehood. He should be distinct in both his personality and his dress from the disbelievers, as Islam has commanded us to be. Allah is the One Who guides to the Straight Path. And Allah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Is there a specific number of times that one should visit Makkah?</title>
    <question>I was recently told by two sources
 that in the Sunnah there is a reference to fulfilling an Islamic precept that one should
 visit Mecca 7 times in ones life and Jerusalem once. Could you please help me verify
 this as I have been unable to.
 Thank you very much for your help.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Whoever makes any claim about Islamic teachings should produce sound evidence. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  Say: Produce your proof if you are truthful.  [al-Baqarah 2:111] So it is not permitted to accept anyones opinion without evidence or proof. What evidence is there that a Muslim should visit Makkah seven times and Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) once in his lifetime?! Allaah has made it a duty to perform Hajj once in a lifetime. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: O people, Allaah has made Hajj a duty upon you, so perform Hajj. A man asked, (Should we do it) every year, O Messenger of Allaah? but he remained silent. The man asked the question three times, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If I say yes, it will be obligatory for you, and you will not be able to do it. Then he said: Do not push me to tell you more than I have told you. Those who came before you were destroyed because they asked too many questions and argued with their Prophets. If I command you to do something, then do as much of it as you can, and if I forbid you to do something, then leave it well alone. (Reported by Muslim, 2380) Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): And perform properly (i.e., all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and Umrah (i.e., the Pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allaah [al-Baqarah 2:196] The person who performs Hajj and Umrah once in his lifetime does not have to do them again, but it is encouraged to repeat Hajj and Umrah, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Follow up one Hajj or Umrah with another, for they eliminate poverty and sins as the fire eliminates dross from iron, gold and silver. An accepted Hajj brings no less a reward than Paradise. (Reported and classed as hasan by al-Tirmidhi, al-Sunan, 738). The Muslim who is capable and healthy is encouraged not to stay away from the Ancient House (i.e., the Kabah) for too long, as Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah says: If a slave to whom I have given good health and ample provision does not come to visit Me once every five years, he is indeed deprived. (Reported by Ibn Hibbaan and others; see Saheeh al-Jaami, 1909). All of the above reports indicate that frequent visits to Makkah are encouraged, but they are not obligatory. As far as visiting Bayt al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) is concerned, if a Muslim never visits it in his lifetime, there is nothing wrong with that. There are no obligatory acts of worship connected with it, but it is the third of the great Mosques which a Muslim is permitted to travel to visit; it is not permitted to travel to any other place for the purpose of prayer and worship, except these three mosques. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No one should set out on a journey (of pilgrimage) except to three mosques: Masjid al-Haram [in Makkah], the Mosque of the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Masjid al-Aqsaa [in Jerusalem]. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 1115). The reward for praying in Masjid al-Aqsaa will be multiplied over the reward for praying in any other mosque, apart from Masjid al-Haram in Makkah and Masjid al-Nabi (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) (The Prophets Mosque) in Madeenah. The author of Mughni al-Muhtaaj said: It has been proven that prayer in Masjid al-Aqsaa is worth five-hundred times more than other prayers, as was reported by Ibn Abd al-Barr; al-Bazzaar said: its isnaad is hasan. Jaabir ibn Abd-Allaah said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: One prayer in this Mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers in any other mosque except for al-Masjid al-Haram, and one prayer in al-Masjid al-Haram is better than one hundred thousand prayers offered elsewhere. (Reported by Imaam Ahmad; see also Saheeh al-Jaami, 3838). And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <question>I go to a 95% muslim school and I have been talking to them, some girls, about Islam and I really understand the islam religion and the ways of life. I want to know all i can find out about islam but there is one problem . My mom .
I want to convert but I'm not sure if I know all I need to know now to convert. What should I learn more about???</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah. This is a great effort that you have undertaken, and you are to be congratulated for the results of your research and your questioning of the Muslim girls. What you need to know are the basic matters which are easy to learn, such as the meaning of the Shahaadatayn (the two statements of faith) - which are the key to Islam - and the six pillars of faith (eemaan) and the five pillars of Islam. You should also learn how to pray so that you can begin to pray after you pronounce the Shahaadatayn. You can find a lot of information on these matters on this website, in the section on 'aqeedah (correct belief), under the headings &quot;Issues relevant to accepting and embracing Islam&quot; and &quot;Basic tenets of Islam for non-Muslims.&quot; As regards your mother, we hope that she will not try to stop you becoming a Muslim. Treat her with kindness and tell her about Islam in beautiful words - maybe she will embrace Islam too. If you are afraid that she may turn against you if she knows about your Islam, then you do not have to tell her about it. Embrace Islam in secret, and do as much as you can of your duties towards Allaah. Allaah will never forsake you; in fact, He will help you and support you, if you turn to Him. We ask Allaah to help you follow the truth and adhere to it. We are prepared to offer any help that we can. Peace be upon those who follow true guidance. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <question>When did Islam start, and how long was the period between Jesus  (upon whom be peace) and Muhammad  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Islam began with the beginning of the Prophet's mission, when Jibraa'eel (the Archangel Gabriel) brought down the Revelation from Allaah in Makkah (Mecca) in the Arabian Peninsula. This occurred on a Monday in the month of Ramadaan, in the fortieth year of the Prophet Muhammad's (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) life, thirteen years before his Hijrah (migration) to Madeenah (which marks the beginning of the Islamic or Hijri calendar). According to the Gregorian calendar, the beginning of the Prophetic mission happened around 608 or 609 CE. Salmaan al-Farsi, may Allaah be pleased with him, one of the Companions of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) reported that between Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and Jesus (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), there were six hundred years.

    <question>Asalam mu alay koem
Dear Brother,
 Please let me know if this is true or not, a lady whom i go to Talim
 Classes with has told me that vegetables grown under ground are makroo, and to cook many
 makrooh things in one pot is Haram.
 We are very used to making stew with more than 5 or 6 vegetables which are
 grown underground all in one pot. Is she telling the truth or is she mistaken.
 Wasalaam,
Sha</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): He it is Who created for you all that is on earth [al-Baqarah 2:29] O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth [al-Baqarah 2:168] Say: Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-Tayyibaat [all kinds of halaal (lawful) things] of food? [al-Araaf 7:32] From this, we know that everything that grows from the earth is in principle halaal (permitted), and no-one should decree it to be haraam (forbidden) or makrooh (disliked) without sound Islamic evidence (daleel). What evidence is there that things that grow beneath the ground, like potatoes, carrots and onions, etc., are makrooh? What is the strange principle on the basis of which this lady  about whose background we know nothing  states that cooking a number of makrooh things in one pot results in haraam food? If the resulting dish was intoxicating or poisonous, or was cooked with something haraam such as pork, then we would say that it is haraam to eat it. But the cooking of five or six kinds of root vegetables together, as you describe, is something permissible, and there is nothing wrong with it. We advise you not to give any weight to the words of those who have no knowledge. Allaah is the One Whom we ask to guide us to the truth and to help us understand our religion. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <answer>Praise be to Allah.There is nothing wrong with that, but if the water is extremely hot, is OK but it is makrooh, because it may harm the skin by burning it and causing pain. There was a dispute long ago about whether heated water would remove impurity or not.

    <title>Discipline of Orphans</title>
    <question>There is a Muslim who married a widow who has two children from her first marriage.Which Islamic rights has this man towards the children? Has the man the right to tell or force the children to pray? Is the boy allowed to call him &quot;daddy&quot;? 
Is there any case he must treat them differently?</question>
    <answer>Related Praise be to Allah.Yes, he should order them to pray, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Instruct the child to pray when he reaches the age of seven (Reported by Abu Dawood in al-Sunan, Kitaab al-salaat, Baab mataa yumar al-sabiyyu bil-salaat). The scholars said: The child should be taught about tahaarah (purity and cleanliness, i.e., wudoo etc) and prayer when he reaches the age of ten years. The meaning of discipline or instruction is to smack (lightly when and if necessary), threaten and rebuke. The childs guardian should teach him about tahaarah and salaat (prayer), and tell the child to do these things, when he reaches the age of seven, and he should discipline him and force him to do them when he reaches the age of ten. The guiding principle here is the hadeeth (narration)of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him): Teach the child to pray when he is seven, and smack him (lightly)if he does not pray when he is ten. (Reported by al-Tirmidhi, who said it is a hasan/sound hadeeth). According to another report, he said: Tell the child to pray when he is seven, and smack him (lightly) if he does not do it when he is ten, and separate them in their beds. This training is ordained by Islam to teach the prayer and let the child get used to praying, so that he will be accustomed to it and will not forget it when he reaches puberty. There is no difference between boys and girls in this matter of discipline. (See Al-Mughni by Ibn Qudaamah, Baab sifat al-salaat). Some people may not feel comfortable about disciplining orphans, but the right approach is for their guardian to teach them and direct them in whatever way is beneficial, even if this involves being harsh with the child for his own sake. There is nothing wrong with that, as the poet said: He was harsh so that they would understand. Let the one who is determined and resolved be harsh sometimes towards those for whom he cares. The scholars said: (A guardian) has the right to (lightly) smack an orphan under his care just as he would (lightly) smack his own child. (See Al-durr al-mukhtaar: Baab al-tazeer). As regards the matter of an orphan calling his guardian Father or Daddy, this question has already been answered: please see question # 1041. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Corruption of the Tawraat (Torah) and Injeel(Gospel)</title>
    <question>What sura in the Quran is related or mentions about the curruption of the Torah and Gospel?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.Allaah says about the Jews (interpretation of the meaning): Do you (faithful believers) covet that they will belive in your religion in spite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allaah (the Tawraat), then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it? [al-Baqarah 2:75] Qutaadah said: The phrase then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it refers to the Jews, who used to hear the words of Allaah, then they altered it after they had understood what it meant. Abu Aaliyah said: They took what Allaah had revealed in their Book describing Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and changed its meaning. Ibn Zayd said: The phrase [they] used to hear the Word of Allaah (the Tawraat), then they used to change it refers to the Tawraat which Allaah revealed to them; they changed it, making what it permitted forbidden, and what was forbidden allowed, changing the truth to falsehood and falsehood to truth [Tafseer Ibn Katheer] Allaah also said (interpretation of the meaning): Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: We hear your word (O Muhammad) and disobey, and Hear and let you (Muhammad) hear nothing. And Raaina [in Arabic this means, Be careful, listen to us and we listen to you, whereas in Hebrew it means an insult.] with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islam). And if only they had said, We hear and obey, and Do make us understand, it would have been better for them, and more proper, but Allaah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except for a few. [al-Nisaa 4:46] The phrase [they] displace words from (their) right places means that they misinterpret them and understand them in a way that Allaah did not intend, doing this deliberately and inventing lies against Allaah. [Tafseer Ibn Katheer] Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): So because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them, and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them. And you will not cease to discover deceit in them, except a few of them. But forgive them, and overlook (their misdeeds). Verily, Allaah loves al-Muhsineen (good-doers). [al-Maaidah 5:13] The phrase because of their breach of their covenant, We cursed them refers to the fact that they broke the Covenant which had been made with them, so Allaah cursed them, i.e., He kept them away from following the True Guidance. [We] made their hearts grow hard means that they will not benefit from any preaching because their hearts are so hard. They change the words from their (right) places means that they play havoc with the words of Allaah and misinterpret His Book, taking it to mean things that were never meant and attributing to Allaah things that He never said; may Allaah protect us from that. [They] have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them means that they stopped following its teachings because they did not want to follow them. Al-Hasan said: They did not adhere to their religion or keep their duties towards Allaah, without which no deeds are acceptable to Him; their fitrah (innate nature) was not sound and their deeds were not righteous. [Tafseer Ibn Katheer] So it becomes quite clear that the ways in which the Children of Israel tampered with the Tawraat and Injeel include the following: Changing Omitting Adding things and attributing to Allaah words that He did not say Misinterpreting the words of Allaah. When Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sent, the original Tawraat and Injeel had already been altered and distorted. Allaah revealed the Quraan to His Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and guaranteed that He Himself would preserve it, as He says (interpretation of the meaning): Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e., the Quraan) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption). [al-Hijr 15:9] This distinguishing feature was not found in any Book before the Quraan. From the time of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) until the present (more than fourteen hundred years) the Quraan has stayed the same, and not a single letter of it has been changed, as ancient manuscripts and the hearts of generation after generation of people who have memorized the entire text and earned the title of haafiz bear witness. We ask Allaah to guide us to the true and straight path. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>Can You Eat Fish Eyes?</title>
    <question>I need to know whether we as Muslims are allowed to eat the eyes of a fish. I was eating at a seafood restaurant with a friend and I was enjoying the head of the fish and then I ate the eye and he was quite disgusted and said that it is not allowed in Islam. Is that true?</question>
    <answer>Contents Related Is seafood halal? Can you eat fish eyes? Disliking certain foods does not mean prohibiting them Praise be to Allah.Is seafood halal? Allah has permitted us all the produce of the sea . Hence we know that all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc. {Lawful to you is (the pursuit of) water-game and its use for food} [al-Maidah 2:96 interpretation of the meaning]. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) told us that it is halal (lawful) to eat dead creatures from the sea and dead fish , and no part of the fish was excluded from this permission. Can you eat fish eyes? Hence we know that all parts of the fish are halal, including its skin, tail, eyes, etc. It is strange indeed that a person could dare to forbid something that Allah has permitted. This is a very serious matter, as Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): {O you who believe! Make not unlawful the tayyibat (all that is good) which Allah has made lawful to you, and transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the transgressors.} [al-Maidah 5:87] {Say: Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and al-Tayyibat [all kinds of halal (lawful) things] of food? Say: They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them). Thus We explain the ayat (Islamic law) in detail for people who have knowledge.} [al-Araf 7:32] {Say: Tell me, what provision Allah has sent down to you! And you have made of it lawful and unlawful. Say: has Allah permitted you (to do so), or do you invent a lie against Allah?} [Yunus 10:59] Allah has also warned His slave against forbidding anything without knowledge. He said (interpretation of the meaning): {And say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely: This is lawful and this is forbidden, so as to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper.} [al-Nahl 16:116] This person who has invented a lie against Allah by saying that it is haram to eat the eye of a fish must repent to Allah, and not go beyond the limits in talking about the Religion of Allah. He should not speak without knowledge. Even if he is put off by something or feels disgusted by it, he has no right to say that it is haram. Disliking certain foods does not mean prohibiting them The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) hated the smell of garlic, and said: Whoever eats anything from this unpleasant plant should not approach us in the mosque. The people said, It has become haram (forbidden), it has become haram. When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) heard what was being said, he said: O people, it is not for me to forbid something that Allah has permitted; this is just a vegetable whose smell is unpleasant. (Reported by Ahmad and Muslim, 877) The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) explained that the fact that he disliked garlic and told people not to come to the mosque after eating it did not mean that it was haram. Although the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) disliked the idea of eating lizard-meat, he did not forbid others to eat it, as is reported in the following story: Khalid ibn al-Walid reported that some grilled lizard meat was brought to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and put in front of him. He stretched out his hand to take some, but one of the people present said, O Messenger of Allah, it is lizard meat, so he pulled his hand back. Khalid ibn al-Walid asked, O Messenger of Allah, is lizard haram? He said, No, but it is not known among my people and I cannot face eating it. So Khalid took some of the lizard meat and ate it, whilst the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) looked on. (Reported by al-Bukhari, 4981, al-Nasai, 4242, and Abu Dawud, 3300) After explaining this answer to you, I want to warn you about something that I noticed in your question, where you said that you went to the seafood restaurant with a male friend. If this person is not your husband or a mahram (blood-relative whom you are permanently forbidden to marry), then you should fear Allah. Ask yourself: which is more serious, eating the eye of a fish or going out with a man to whom you are not related to sit and chat with him in a restaurant? I ask Allah to protect us from all things that earn His wrath and to help us remember and fear Him. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad.

    <title>A woman refusing to have intercourse with her husband</title>
    <question>If wife deos not allow his husband to
   have intercourse than what will    happen to women.
  1.Women will be divorced.
   2.Man should give her divorce.
   3.Man should marriage someone else.
   4.Others.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If a woman refuses her husbands request to come to bed with no Islamically-sound reason (such as sickness, or his being drunk, for example), what happens is as described below: Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: If a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses [and does not come], and he spends the night angry with her, the angels will curse her until morning. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4794; the additional phrase quoted in square brackets is from Abu Dawood, al-Sunan, Kitaab al-Nikaah, Bab haqq al-zawj alal-marah). In the phrase if a man calls his wife to his bed, the word bed is obviously a metaphor for intercourse. Metaphors are used in the Quraan and Sunnah to refer to things about which people usually feel shy. Does this apply only to the nighttime, or does it include daytime too? The answer may be found in a hadeeth narrated by Muslim: By the One in Whose hand is my soul, there is no man who calls his wife to his bed and she refuses, but the One Who is above the heavens [i.e. Allaah] will be angry with her, until he (her husband) is pleased with her. Ibn Khuzaymah and Ibn Hibbaan report a hadeeth narrated by Jaabir: There are three whose prayers will not be accepted and none of whose good deeds will ascend to heaven: a runaway slave, until he returns to his master; a drunken man until he becomes sober; and a woman with whom her husband is angry, until he is pleased with her. These are general terms, which include both night and day. The phrase and he spends the night angry with her refers to the cause of the angels curse, because this confirms that she is a sinner, which is a different matter than if he accepts her excuse and is not angry with her, or lets the matter drop. Is she to blame if he keeps her away from his bed? The answer is: no, unless she is the one who started the separation and he is keeping away from her because of it, and she did not apologize but prolonged the separation. But if he is the one who started it, and is thus treating her unfairly, then she is not to blame. In one report, instead of the words the angels curse her until morning, the wording is  until she returns  and this is a useful variant. This hadeeth tells us that denying a spouses rights  whether physical or financial  is something that will inevitably bring about the wrath of Allaah, unless Allaah grants His mercy to the sinner. We also learn that the angels will pray against a sinner so long as he or she persists in the sin. The hadeeth also directs a wife to help her husband and seek his satisfaction, because a man is less patient than a woman when it comes to doing without intercourse. The most disturbing thing for a man is his sexual impulse, so Islam urges women to help their husbands in this regard. (Adapted and abbreviated from the commentary by al-Haafiz Ibn Hijr  may Allaah have mercy on him  on this hadeeth in Fath al-Baari). Whether the husband wants to discipline his wife, or forgive her, or take another wife, or divorce her, this is all up to him to choose. Let the woman beware of incurring her husbands wrath because this will lead to Allaahs being angry with her. We ask Allaah to rectify this situation. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Permissibility of marrying a second wife</title>
    <question>Is it permissible for a person who cannot adjust with his current wife to marry a second wife? He does not want to leave his first wife.</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger. It is OK for you to marry a second wife, and in fact this could be the solution to your problem, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): &quot; then marry women of your choice, two or three, or four&quot; [al-Nisaa 4:3] - as long as you are going to treat them equally with regard to where you spend your nights and how much you spend on them. So if you spend one night with one, and the next night with the other, and spend on them equally, there is nothing wrong at all with marrying a second wife. And Allaah knows best.</answer>

    <title>How to give classes to a mixed group of (teenage) boys and girls</title>
    <question>I am a high school student who
   recently came to Toronto, Canada, I was in riyadh for 13 years and I am giving islamic
   halaqas in my high school to Muslim students. Boys to my left and girls to my right,
   the question is: Is this ikhtilat ?? Mixing between boys and girls?? I am the MSA
   leader and not quite sure of this issue ,,,, Salam</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.May Allaah reward you for your efforts in giving useful lessons to these Muslim students in your city, who are in the greatest need of learning about their religion in a land of kufr. Perhaps your background of having lived in Saudi Arabia will help you with this. I advise you to concentrate on teaching them about Tawheed and correct Islamic aqeedah (belief), explaining how to do acts of worship from a Fiqh point of view, and teaching them the biographies of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his Companions. As for the matter which you raised in your question, letting boys and girls sit together facing one another in one halaqah is not free from dangers, as you know. I think that you feel the same way, which is what made you ask this question, especially when we expect that the hijaab of the girls where you live is incomplete and that the faces of some of them, at least, are uncovered in front of the boys. For this reason I suggest one of two things: either get the girls to sit behind the boys, wearing full hijaab, so that you dont feel embarrassed when you face the group to give a lesson; or put up a barrier or screen between the boys and girls, such that they can still hear your voice, if the girls do not want to wear full hijaab. Then they can ask questions from behind the screen, so long as they are not soft in speech, or they can write questions on pieces of paper. May Allaah help us and you to do good and to call people to His way and earn His pleasure. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Asking about a persons past</title>
    <question>As-salam wai lai kum,
 When helping brothers/sisters to find
   suitable Muslim partners, what questions can be asked, and what is forbidden to ask ?
   Can one ask about their past when they were
   non-Muslim or not practicing Muslims ?
 Can one ask ones wife/sister to describe in
   detail the appearance of an intended wife or describe in detail to them regarding a
   brother ?
   Was Salam</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If you want to look for a wife for someone, or a husband for a woman, then you can ask him about his wishes, such as the desired age, level of education, employment situation, country and origin and position of the family, and whether he has any preferences about her general appearance, such as skin colour, height, etc. The most important characteristic to ask about is a persons level of commitment to Islam. This kind of useful question is fine. But asking for details of a persons past and wanting to know what sins they might have committed when they were ignorant about Islam  this is not right at all. Allaah covers peoples sins and loves to see them covered (i.e., not dragged out into the open). So long as a person has repented, his sins have been wiped out. Islam deletes whatever came before, so why should we ask questions that will only embarrass people? Allaah accepts peoples repentance without their having to confess or expose their sins to any other person. A number of the Sahaabah had committed adultery and murder repeatedly, or had buried infant girls alive, or stolen things, but when they entered Islam they were the best of people. No one needs to be reminded of a shameful past; it is over and done with, and Allaah is the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful. What matters when considering a person for marriage is how that person is now: is he righteous or not? Has he cut all ties with his past and his wrong deeds, or not? If he is clearly living a good and righteous life now, then it is wrong to dig up the past. If there is any fear of anything that could have future implications, such as certain diseases and so on, then there are medical tests which can give the answer and put your mind at rest. As far as giving a detailed description of a prospective wife to someone is concerned, this can be done in writing: one of her mahram relatives (i.e. a blood relative to whom marriage is permanently forbidden) or a woman who knows her can write down a description, then a trustworthy person can deliver it to one who is seriously considering a marriage proposal. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: No woman should describe another woman to her husband as if he can see her. (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4839) The wisdom behind this prohibition is the fact that a husband might like the sound of what he hears, so he may divorce the one who described the other to him, or there may be temptation to do wrong. (Commentary on the above hadeeth in Fath al-Baari). We ask Allaah to help us all to do that which He loves and will earn His pleasure. May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad.</answer>

    <title>Upon whom is it obligatory to call to Allah?</title>
    <question>Is calling to Allah obligatory on every Muslim, be a man or a woman, or is propagation confined to scholars and knowledge seekers?</question>
    <answer>Praise be to Allah.If one is knowledgeable of what he is propagating, it does not matter whether he is a great scholar, a knowledge seeker, or a common Muslim. The Prophet, Peace and blessings be upon him said, Report from me even if a verse. Therefore, the caller to faith does not have to be of great knowledge, but one should be knowledgeable of what he is calling to otherwise one be a caller with sheer passion, which is not allowed. Those people are apt to falling into dangerous abyss: preventing what Allah has permitted and imposing what He has not imposed. This is devastating because prohibiting something that has been made legal by Allah is similar to legalizing something He has prevented.</answer>
